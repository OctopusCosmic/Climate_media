0,"Candidates for the 1st District congressional seat responded Sunday to a broad range of questions on environmental sustainability, ranging from global warming and alternative transportation to how highly they regard the environment.\Democrat Chellie Pingree and Republican Charlie Summers answered questions posed by moderator Irwin Gratz, host of Maine Public Radio's ""Morning Edition."" The forum was held in the library of the University of Southern Maine in Portland.\Questions were determined by forum sponsors - a group of Maine-based organizations concerned about the environment.\Both candidates said protecting Maine's environment would be a top priority if they are elected to Congress.\""I can't think of anything that would be a higher priority for me,"" Summers said. ""We all breathe the same air and drink the same water. And we all have a responsibility to ensuring we have a clean environment.""\Pingree pointed out that she is from an island community where one instance of pollution can affect the entire population.\""For me (protection of the environment), it's critical,"" Pingree said. ""It's an underpinning of my value system.""\On the issue of Mainers' reliance on heating oil - Gratz said Maine people spend more than $1.5 billion per year out-of-state to buy heating oil - Pingree said she'd like to see more funds spent on weatherization programs because such measures will save money in the long run.\Pingree also said she supports developing more alternative sources of energy, including wind power.\Summers said he would support offshore drillling, adding that every day the United States imports a barrel of oil, ""we are less secure.""\Summers said he would support legislation that would give a tax credit to people who purchase energy-efficient cars.\Gratz asked the candidates where they stood on cap-and-trade, a way for government to get large-scale polluters to gradually reduce carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.\Summers and Pingree took different positions on a federal cap-and-trade program to reduce global warming pollution 80 percent by the year 2050.\""I don't support a cap-and-trade system,"" Summers said. ""All it does is allow someone to purchase the right to pollute. We need to punish bad behavior by discouraging companies from polluting.""\Pingree said she would support cap-and-trade agreements because they encourage economic growth while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. ""It is clearly one of the best ideas out there,"" she said.\The candidates were asked how they will ensure that the needs of bicyclists and pedestrians are met in the 2009 federal transportation bill.\Pingree, who described herself as an ""avid bicyclist,"" said she would like to see more people riding their bikes to work and on errands - especially in urban areas. She vowed to work toward putting more funds toward Amtrak and passenger rail service.\Summers said he is a ""huge fan and user"" of public transportation. But rather than have the government legislate alternative forms of transit, Summers called upon Americans to take the lead.\""We can't expect the government to do this for us. We have to be active participants in becoming an energy-independent country,"" he said.\Staff Writer Dennis Hoey can be contacted at 791-6365 or at:\dhoey@pressherald.com\Credit: By DENNIS HOEY Staff Writer"
1,"Maine and nine other northeastern states will break new ground Thursday with the launch of a regional effort to fight global warming.\The effort - called a cap-and-trade program - means large power plants that want to discharge carbon dioxide after this year will have to buy pollution allowances from the states or from each other.\The carbon market will open for business Thursday, when Maine and some of the other states hold an Internet-based auction that will be watched around the country.\""This is the wave of the future and we're going to be on the cutting edge of it,"" said Michael Stoddard of Environment Northeast, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization focused on environmental concerns.\No one knows for sure what the market price for allowances will be Thursday, or how soon the cap-and-trade system will lead to actual cutbacks in pollution. But state officials, conservationists and power generators say it is a historic step that might lead to a broader national program.\""Certainly, one of the biggest things we were trying to do is serve as a national model and sort of lead by example,"" said Jim Brooks, director of the air bureau for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. ""It has spurred a lot of discussion all across the country.""\Both major presidential candidates have said they support a national cap-and-trade system to cut pollution, and states in other regions of the country are considering their own versions.\Maine and the other northeastern states have been working for five years to create the program known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI (pronounced ""reggie"").\Starting in 2009, the region's 233 largest power plants will need one allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from burning coal, oil or natural gas. The entire region is capped at 188 million tons each year for the next six years, and each state gets to sell a portion of the allowances depending on the capacity of its power plants.\Starting in 2014, the overall cap will then decrease 2.5 percent each year, for a 10 percent reduction by 2019, making the allowances increasingly scarce and hard to get.\In Maine, six power plants are covered by the program and awaiting Thursday's initial auction. Maine will have 6 million tons of carbon dioxide allowances to sell the first year, and it will put a little less than 1 million on the auction block Thursday, with the remainder being available for distribution at future auctions.\As the new market is established and power companies figure out what the allowances will cost them, Mainers can expect to see electricity rates climb from 1 percent to 3 percent, according to the DEP. That could add $1 to $3 a month to the power bill of a typical household.\But state officials and advocates expect customers to ultimately save money because of how the proceeds will be used. Maine stands to earn $10 million to nearly $30 million a year from the sale of the allowances, and will put most of the revenues into energy efficiency programs that could help consumers reduce their electricity usage or heating bills.\A trust set up by the Maine Legislature has yet to decide how to distribute the money for conservation.\The cap-and-trade system eventually will force the region's dirtiest power generators to improve or shut down, and it will immediately make cleaner alternatives more attractive to investors, Stoddard said.\""Carbon pollution carries a cost to our environment, and now that cost is being reflected in market prices,"" he said. ""All those alternatives will be a little more competitive.""\The program, which is similar to programs in Europe, is administered by a nonprofit based in New York.\The auction on Thursday and the others that will follow - there will be six in the first year - will be done electronically, with buyers not knowing who else is placing bids.\State officials will not release any results from the first auction until they are officially certified, probably Sunday or Monday, according to the DEP.\Some observers have been predicting a weak demand at Thursday's auction as power generators take a wait-and-see approach. Also, there is not expected to be any shortage of allowances in the first year, at least, because mild weather and high energy costs have reduced overall demand for power.\On the other hand, a cold winter or a rebounding economy could increase power generation - and the demand for pollution allowances, observers said. And no one knows whether some private buyers will place bids as a way to keep allowances out of the hands of the power plants to prevent pollution.\""I hope that we have brisk trading. We're predicting anywhere from $2 to $5"" for each one-ton allowance, Brooks said.\""The generators in Maine could choose to sit on the sidelines for this first auction or they could dip their toes in just to get the experience,"" Stoddard said.\Spokesmen for the power plants weren't revealing their plans.\""We're certainly anxious to partake in the auction and see how it all works out,"" said Al Wiley of Florida Power & Light, owner of the Wyman Station power plant in Yarmouth.\At the same time, there will be plenty more opportunities to buy, he said.\Like other Maine generators, Florida Power & Light has generally supported the program while also saying it should include all carbon dioxide sources - not just large power plants - and should not be limited to just one region of the country.\""If you really want to deal with climate change in an appropriate way,"" Wiley said, ""you really ought to broaden your influence.""\Staff Writer John Richardson can be contacted at 791-6324 or at:\jrichardson@pressherald.com\[Sidebar]\THE PROGRAM\THE REGIONAL Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, requires large power-generating plants in 10 northeastern states to buy one allowance for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the atmosphere starting in 2009. Allowances can be purchased at auctions directly from the states or from each other in the private market. The overall number of allowances will be capped for six years and then gradually reduced, making it increasingly expensive to pollute and forcing the dirtiest plants to improve or shut down. Maine and other states will use revenue from the sale of allowances to encourage energy efficiency and conservation.\THE 10 PARTICIPATING STATES ARE: MAINE, VERMONT, NEW HAMPSHIRE, MASSACHUSETTS, CONNECTICUT, RHODE ISLAND, NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, DELAWARE AND MARYLAND.\MAINE HAS SIX FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS THAT GENERATE MORE THAN 25 MEGAWATTS AND MUST BUY ALLOWANCES.

2," Maine's two Republican senators broke ranks and joined Democrats on Wednesday, giving life to an effort to overturn new federal rules for controlling mercury pollution. Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe signed a petition that now has enough signatures to force a full Senate vote on the rules, which will help to determine how much mercury is allowed to drift into Maine in the years ahead.\ The fight is over how strict to make the regulations. The Maine senators and environmentalists contend that the Environmental Protection Agency was too lenient in setting standards for the neurotoxin. State officials say mercury pollution is the primary reason Maine's lakes and freshwater fish are contaminated.\ ""I'm very disappointed in the EPA rule,"" said Collins, who signed the petition along with Snowe to force a full Senate vote. ""It's disturbing, to me, that EPA is proposing such a weak rule.""\ Representatives of the coal-burning power plants that face the regulations say that opponents are trying to derail the country's first standards for mercury.\ ""Frankly, I think it's bad policy to try and stop the first mercury regulations ever because they're not fast enough,"" said Frank Maisano, a lawyer representing the industry. ""It proves the old adage that no good deed toward pollution control goes unpunished.""\ The Senate effort could be largely symbolic, because even advocates acknowledge that it could be opposed in the House and by President Bush. But supporters argued that the vote would put the Senate on record in the contentious debate on air pollution, and could pave the way for success in the future.\ ""I don't know that we'll be successful, but at least we'll . . . shine a spotlight on the EPA,"" Collins said.\ Enactment of the regulation is pending. It was finalized on March 15 and published in the Federal Register. Basically, it aims to reduce mercury emissions about 70 percent by 2018, from about 48 tons per year to 15 tons. The strategy for reaching the goal includes a cap-and-trade system to allow cleaner plants to offset pollution from dirtier plants.\ The complaint from Maine officials and environmental groups is that the Clinton administration, in its waning days, proposed stricter limits under a different strategy, called maximum achievable control technology. Legislative proposals called for a 90 percent reduction by 2010.\ Mainers worry about air pollution because an estimated 80 percent of mercury pollution floats into the state from power plants in the Midwest. Brownie Carson, executive director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said the Bush administration's rule would allow three times as much pollution to reach Maine.\ ""It's impossible to overstate how destructive this rule is of public health and the environment because of mercury and other toxic pollution,"" he said.\ The proposed regulation's path has already been controversial. Both the Governmental Accountability Office and the EPA's inspector general criticized the way the rule was drafted. A dozen states, including Maine, filed lawsuits challenging the regulation in court.\ But power-industry representatives argued that the mercury rule should be allowed to reduce pollution under the same strategy that has been used to reduce acid rain.\ ""Had the agency plowed ahead with a mercury `maximum achievable control technology' rule, as critics of the current rule proposed, the resulting regulation would have fallen like a house of cards in a hurricane,"" said Dan Riedinger, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute.\ The latest congressional effort calls for a joint resolution disapproving of the regulation, which is rare. The last time such a move was successful was in March 2001, when Congress scuttled a Clinton administration rule to prevent workplace injuries.\ To force a vote on the mercury resolution, 30 senators had to sign a petition to send the resolution directly to the Senate floor, rather than through the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee. Collins became the 30th senator, and the first Republican, to sign the petition, followed by Snowe.\ ""The EPA has refused to make any accommodation to those of us who have deeply held concerns regarding this rule,"" Snowe said. ""The stakes are too high for Congress not to have a say.""\ The petition requires a vote within 60 legislative days, which means it could occur before the August recess.\ Forecasts in the Senate are murky. As part of the debate on an energy bill, the Senate rejected proposals to limit emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide or require better mileage from sport-utility vehicles. But even if the resolution passes, the presumption is that the House will oppose the resolution.\ In the House, Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, and others proposed a companion resolution. But it is much tougher to force a vote in the House, where 218 signatures are needed on such a petition.\ ""In all honesty, prospects in the House are somewhere between slim and none,"" Carson said. And even if it passed both chambers, two-thirds majorities would be needed to override a possible veto.\ Still, Carson applauded Collins and Snowe for forcing the vote.\ ""Senators are going to have to either vote for the health of children and protection of the environment or they're going to be siding with polluting coal and oil plants,"" Carson said.\ Washington Correspondent Bart Jansen can be contacted at 202-488- 1119 or at:\ bjansen@pressherald.com"
3,"A one-year-old regional experiment with carbon cap-and-trade has so far generated $13.5 million for energy conservation efforts in Maine.\But it could ultimately have a far bigger impact, in Maine and nationwide.\A much more ambitious cap-and-trade plan introduced in the U.S. Senate last week is based, at least in part, on the lessons learned here.\""The hope ... was that it would influence the national policy,"" said Thomas Tietenberg, a retired Colby College economics professor who helped develop Maine's piece of the program. ""And I think it did.""\Maine was one of 10 states to create the nation's first market-based system to fight climate change. By putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions, it encourages large power plants to become cleaner and more efficient.\It's too early to measure any effects on pollution or on electricity prices, especially given a recession that has reduced production - and thus emissions - far more than any government action.\The program has its flaws, including a cap on emissions that turned out to be too generous. But it also is seen as an innovative way to fight climate change, and as a model.\""Clearly (it) has established that a cap-and-trade system can work and work very well in the United States,"" said David Littell, commissioner of Maine's Department of Environmental Protection. ""Before that, people were skeptical.""\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, was effectively launched in September 2008 with the first carbon allowance auction in the United States.\RGGI, which is pronounced ""Reggie,"" requires large electricity producers in the Northeast to have one allowance for every ton of carbon dioxide they put into the atmosphere from burning coal, oil or gas. They can either buy the allowances at quarterly government auctions or trade among themselves.\The basic idea is that the power industry has a new incentive to shift to cleaner-burning fuels, such as gas, and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that scientists say contribute to global warming.\The other principle behind cap-and-trade systems is that the number of overall allowances in the marketplace - the cap - will gradually be reduced over time, ensuring across-the-board pollution reductions.\TRYING TO 'GET IT RIGHT'\RGGI is similar to a cap-and-trade system in Europe, with an American twist. The Europeans gave allowances away, while RGGI auctions them off to the highest bidders.\Ted Koffman, former House chairman of the Legislature's Natural Resources Committee, remembers how a visit from members of Britain's Parliament helped convince state officials in the Northeast to try something new.\""They felt they had failed because they gave away the allowances. It didn't create a market,"" said Koffman, who is now executive director of Maine Audubon. ""We felt if we got it right, we could help the nation get it right.""\Giving away allowances reduces the initial cost to the companies and to electric ratepayers but opens the door to unpredictable prices in the private trading market for allowances.\Auctioning off allowances sets a stable, and public, clearing price, while contributing to an increase in electricity costs. However, the Northeastern states decided to use the revenue generated by the auctions to pay for energy efficiency improvements, ranging from small residential projects to large industrial ones. That, according to economists, would eventually reduce the need for new power generating capacity and, as result, reduce electricity rates.\""The notion that you would auction off the allowances was a completely alien philosophy until RGGI,"" Tietenberg said.\In Maine, RGGI is expected to increase electricity costs about 1.5 percent over 10 years.\RGGI has so far held five electronic auctions of carbon allowances, with power plants and other investors paying a total of $432.7 million to the states.\Who buys the allowances, and how many they buy, is confidential under the rules set up by the states. Because the recession has led to such big price drops for oil and natural gas, any impact on electricity prices so far is unknown.\""The auctions have worked well,"" said Bill Cohen, a spokesman for Verso Paper, which has to buy allowances because it generates and sells power at mills in Bucksport and Jay. Cohen would not discuss how much the company has spent on the allowances, but said the program has not created any hardships.\""We didn't anticipate a whole lot of problems,"" he said. ""We had already made significant reductions in our CO2 output.""\Of the $13.5 million raised through the auctions of Maine's allowances, only $650,000 has been spent. It was allocated on an emergency basis last fall, when heating oil prices were approaching $5 a gallon, to weatherize the homes of low-income Mainers.\The Maine State Housing Authority used the bulk of that money $500,000 to weatherize about 120 homes. The Passamaquoddy Tribe and Community Concepts Inc., a South Paris-based agency, shared the remainder.\Other RGGI funds are dedicated to a combination of energy efficiency programs, from incentives to promote compact fluorescent bulbs and energy-efficient home appliances to large industrial projects valued between $100,000 and $1 million.\""It means now we have put programs in place that are helping our citizens and our consumers use energy more efficiently,"" said Michael Stoddard, deputy director of Environment Northeast, a Portland-based advocacy group. ""And that's going to serve us well when a new federal cap-and-trade system is implemented.""\The RGGI experiment hasn't been perfect, however.\WHAT THE CRITICS SAY\The cap on the number of allowances was intentionally set high to start out so that it wouldn't immediately restrict emissions and raise the cost of allowances. Then the recession pushed energy production and emissions down farther.\Regulated emissions in the region are now believed to be about 20 percent below the overall cap. In Maine, the gap appears to be even bigger. Maine has about 6 million allowances to sell each year, but the six power plants that are covered by that cap only produced 3.6 million tons of carbon emissions last year, in part because of mild weather, according to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.\That surplus of allowances is one reason that auction prices have declined since a year ago, from $3.51 per ton in a March auction to $2.19 in the latest auction last month. Uncertainty about a future national cap-and-trade program, and how RGGI allowances will fit in, also is keeping prices down, experts say.\Another criticism of RGGI has to do with the spending side.\Anthony Buxton, a Portland lawyer who represents paper mills and other large industrial electricity customers, said it is industry that faces the largest costs if auction revenue isn't used to reduce electricity use and prices. And, he said, the first use of money winterizing homes was a poor precedent.\""We were concerned that it would not be a program focused on cutting carbon but instead become a welfare program, and that in fact happened,"" Buxton said. ""We regard it as unconscionable that no money has gone out into some very valuable carbon-saving projects (in large industrial plants). If you're going to do something about climate change, you've got to take the best projects first.""\Officials with the Energy and Carbon Savings Trust, which oversees the auction proceeds, say it took time to create the new program, but that the money is coming. Last week, in fact, state officials announced a new $9 million grant program for large-scale energy-efficiency and renewable energy projects that will be paid for with auction proceeds and federal economic stimulus funds.\SHAPING THE DEBATE\Given its strengths and weaknesses, it's not clear exactly how much of the RGGI concepts will end up in the national plan.\The congressional proposal does include auctions and the use of proceeds to promote energy efficiency, hallmarks of the RGGI program. However, most allowances would be given away in the beginning to reduce the immediate costs.\While officials in Maine and the other RGGI states want more use of auctions, they only dealt with one industry and a region that isn't reliant on the coal or oil industries. The federal plan would be much broader, going beyond power plants to include virtually all sources of emissions nationwide. Even motorists would effectively be covered because fuel importers would need to hold allowances.\The federal cap also would decline more aggressively and cover other heat trapping gases, such as methane, in addition to carbon dioxide.\Still, there is little doubt that Maine and the other RGGI states are shaping the debate.\""It's the only functioning compliance program in the United States right now,"" said Kathy Lee, a Maine-based global carbon markets consultant. ""You go to a carbon meeting internationally and everyone knows RGGI. ... People continue to look at it as a model. Not that it's perfect, but it's working.""\Staff Writer John Richardson can be contacted at 791-6324 or at:\jrichardson@pressherald.com\[Sidebar]\RGGI: LEADING THE WAY ON CAP-AND-TRADE\THE REGIONAL Greenhouse Gas InitiativeI requires large power-generating plants in 10 Northeastern states to buy one allowance for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the atmosphere, starting in 2009.\ALLOWANCES CAN be purchased at auctions directly from the states or from each other in the private market.\THE OVERALL NUMBER of allowances will be capped for six years and then gradually reduced by 10 percent by the end of 2018, making it increasingly expensive to pollute and forcing the dirtiest plants to improve or shut down.

This has kept the coal-burning power-generation industry from making the necessary changes to its plants, which would help the environment.

When is a tax not a tax? When it can be hidden under another name, of course.
\
Anyone who lives in one of nine Northeastern states, including Maine, and uses electricity pays for ""emission allowances"" to support ""green"" energy projects and efficiency programs under a 6-year-old law called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI, commonly pronounced ""Reggie"").
\
It used to be 10 states, but in 2011, Republican Gov. Chris Christie took New Jersey out of the compact.
\
The New York Times quoted Christie as saying, ""RGGI does nothing more than tax electricity, tax our citizens (and) tax our businesses, with no discernible or measurable impact upon our environment.""
\
When the program took effect in 2008, The Times noted, ""Ten Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states ranging from Maine to Maryland set a ceiling on carbon dioxide emissions (that would) require power plants to purchase credits or allowances that allow them to emit specified amounts of carbon dioxide.""
\
The ""cap-and-trade"" program, it said, lets ""companies that cut their emissions below their designated caps ... to sell or trade their excess carbon allowances in online auctions.""
\
Christie, however, called RGGI ""a failure,"" noting that ""power suppliers have easily met their caps, and carbon allowances are trading at bottom-level prices because plants are taking advantage of cheap prices for natural gas, which is less polluting than fuels like coal.""
\
The government had a ""fix"" for RGGI's woeful ineffectiveness: Raise the cost of the permits.
\
A new analysis of the program, prepared jointly by the Maine Heritage Policy Center and the Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University (two think tanks that make no apologies for defending the free market), says, ""RGGI changed its 'Model Rule' to cut the number of allowances available for auction by almost half. ... As a result, allowance prices increased dramatically,"" potentially tripling by 2020.
\
Needless to say, it's not the power companies that pay for those permits. Ratepayers are the ones on the hook, and Mainers have paid $48 million into the program since 2008.
\
What happens to the money? State governments ""invest"" it in projects favored by politicians and bureaucrats, including high-cost, but low-return, wind and solar projects and energy-efficiency programs directed not by consumer choice but by government-approved grants to companies favored by the states.
\
In Maine, at least, 35 percent of RGGI payments subsidizes home energy upgrades and conversions for the next three years.
\
Many may think those purposes are worthwhile, but if these programs are good ideas, they should be supported by taxes whose purposes are openly linked to their outcomes. That's just simple honesty.
\
But the justification for charging us for these ""allowances"" is false for two reasons: First, RGGI, as Christie noted, fails in its reason for existing, as it has no impact on the environment that anyone can determine.
\
While global warming theorists say carbon dioxide emissions will inevitably lead to higher temperatures, a 30 percent increase since the 1850s has produced no discernible warming for almost two decades.
\
And carbon dioxide emissions in the United States have been dropping without any national ""cap-and-trade"" program (which Congress has refused to pass), partly because of the recent business downturn but primarily because of the widespread adoption of cleaner natural gas for power generation.
\
Second, the emissions saved by RGGI are ""a rounding error of a rounding error"" when viewed globally, as Beacon Hill's director of research, Paul Bachman, told a MHPC gathering last week.
\
With China, India and other nations building new coal-fired power plants by the hundreds, what Maine saves is metaphorically equivalent to taking a pail of water out of Sebago Lake.
\
And yet, RGGI is costly: According the MHPC/Beacon Hill analysis, a Maine withdrawal from RGGI would save consumers ""$106 million to $132 million from 2015 to 2020; raise employment by an expected 270 to 330 jobs over the period; increase Mainers' real disposable income by $10 million to $11 million; and boost investment by $5 million to $6 million.""
\
(The studies claiming these savings are available on the organizations' websites: www.mainepolicy.org and www.beaconhill.org.)
\
RGGI's defenders dispute those figures, using thumb-on-the-scale economic models that claim a huge ""multiplier effect"" for government spending while simultaneously minimizing the effects of private investment.
\
As with any dueling studies, you can pick whichever one you like. But let's set aside liberals' self-serving claims that the think tanks are ""biased"" while tax-rising bureaucrats and lawmakers are ""objective.""
\
As if. Instead, progressive politicians wanted to raise money for their pet ""green"" programs, but figured that might not be an easy sell to taxpayers. So they disguised their tax-and-spend programs under the camouflage of ""global warming,"" raising taxes behind a smokescreen of environmental virtue.
\
Christie saw through it, and saved his state's consumers tens of millions of dollars. Why can't we do that for Mainers?

Many may think those purposes are worthwhile, but if these programs are good ideas, they should be supported by taxes whose purposes are openly linked to their outcomes. That's just simple honesty.
\
But the justification for charging us for these ""allowances"" is false for two reasons: First, RGGI, as Christie noted, fails in its reason for existing, as it has no impact on the environment that anyone can determine.
\
While global warming theorists say carbon dioxide emissions will inevitably lead to higher temperatures, a 30 percent increase since the 1850s has produced no discernible warming for almost two decades.
\
And carbon dioxide emissions in the United States have been dropping without any national ""cap-and-trade"" program (which Congress has refused to pass), partly because of the recent business downturn but primarily because of the widespread adoption of cleaner natural gas for power generation.
\
Second, the emissions saved by RGGI are ""a rounding error of a rounding error"" when viewed globally, as Beacon Hill's director of research, Paul Bachman, told a MHPC gathering last week.
\
With China, India and other nations building new coal-fired power plants by the hundreds, what Maine saves is metaphorically equivalent to taking a pail of water out of Sebago Lake.
\
And yet, RGGI is costly: According the MHPC/Beacon Hill analysis, a Maine withdrawal from RGGI would save consumers ""$106 million to $132 million from 2015 to 2020; raise employment by an expected 270 to 330 jobs over the period; increase Mainers' real disposable income by $10 million to $11 million; and boost investment by $5 million to $6 million.""
\
(The studies claiming these savings are available on the organizations' websites: www.mainepolicy.org and www.beaconhill.org.)
\
RGGI's defenders dispute those figures, using thumb-on-the-scale economic models that claim a huge ""multiplier effect"" for government spending while simultaneously minimizing the effects of private investment.
\
As with any dueling studies, you can pick whichever one you like. But let's set aside liberals' self-serving claims that the think tanks are ""biased"" while tax-rising bureaucrats and lawmakers are ""objective.""
\
As if. Instead, progressive politicians wanted to raise money for their pet ""green"" programs, but figured that might not be an easy sell to taxpayers. So they disguised their tax-and-spend programs under the camouflage of ""global warming,"" raising taxes behind a smokescreen of environmental virtue.
\
Christie saw through it, and saved his state's consumers tens of millions of dollars. Why can't we do that for Mainers?

7,"How did I become that dad? The dad who, when confronted by his offspring's youthful optimism and liberal ideals, mumbles something about how the real world works and shakes his head?\But there I was, talking about the economy and what to do about its sorry state with my 15-year-old, when he piped in with, ""I think the key is green-collar jobs.""\I responded with a smile, and a pinprick of a question: ""And where does the money come from to pay the people with the green-collar jobs?""\The response was a smile then a slack jaw and a quiet, ""I don't know.""\It comes from the economy, I explained. From you and me. There are real and substantial upfront costs associated with protecting the environment, I said. There's no magic ""green"" money fairy who is going to pay us to do the right thing. Protecting the planet is an investment. People who try to dress up environmentalism as economic development are hiding the truth.\This is not to say there isn't money to be made by individuals and corporations working to keep the environment clean. Plenty of companies, from hazardous-waste cleanup specialists to the makers of air-pollution-control equipment, employ plenty of people in the name of protecting our environment.\A CLEANER PLANET IS NOT FREE\But the pollution control equipment we require the local power company to install has to be paid for, and usually it's the power company's customers who get stuck with the tab. That doesn't fit neatly with the environmentalist story line, which often pits corporate profits against a cleaner planet. But, in case you haven't noticed, the corporations still make profits after being required to cut pollution. It's safe to conclude they pass those costs on to someone, and that someone is us.\But here's where I part company with many conservatives who hammer home the point that cleaning the planet is not free. I say that's OK. Protecting the environment is worth the money, and there really is a long-term economic benefit to avoiding bad environmental outcomes.\This money-versus-the-environment story line was playing itself out in Congress last week. A carbon-emissions-reduction plan aimed at getting a start on the problem of global climate change was debated and later withdrawn in the Senate.\Proponents of the plan, known as cap and trade, have promoted it as a market-based approach to cleaning up the environment that will create wealth and promote efficiency while cleaning up the air.\Well, sort of.\A cap-and-trade system starts with setting a limit on the amount of pollution a particular group can emit. Then it creates a system of pollution credits. In this case, polluters would face new limits on their greenhouse-gas emissions. If they pollute less than those limits, then they can sell pollution credits to someone who hasn't met them.\What's good about this system is that it uses market forces to find the cheapest way possible to cut emissions. Those who can make cuts cheaply will exceed requirements so they can sell credits. For those companies than can't reach the targets without spending unreasonable sums, they can buy these credits.\This system works really well for pollution problems that are global in scope, like greenhouse gases and the emissions that cause acid rain. It breaks down a bit when the goal is to cut emissions that matter locally, like soot, mercury and the gases that cause ozone, because the system can't guarantee that pollution will be controlled where it poses a problem.\What's cool about cap and trade is that it lets industry figure out the best way to hit greenhouse-gas targets, and that means it will cost us less to reach those goals than if emissions were restricted across the board.\Some in the environmental movement don't like this approach because it means some companies will still get to keep on polluting as always. On the other end of the spectrum, many conservatives have assailed these plans because - and they're right on this - this is an artificial market, created by government regulation. At the end of the day, it still represents the power of government telling industry what to do.\And that's true. The legislation would still impose costs that we're all going to have to pay in the form of higher prices for electricity and goods and services generally.\Supporters of cap and trade shouldn't run away from that. Cutting greenhouse-gas emissions will cost us in the short- and medium-term. There's no getting around that, and I suppose if you don't regard climate change as a threat, you wonder why we should spend the money.\WELL WORTH THE PRICE\But the risk that climate change could harm the planet is real - notice I didn't say it was a certainty, it's a risk. Also, what we'll get coincidently when we address this problem - less dependence on fossil fuels, fewer pollutants of all kinds put into the atmosphere - has real value.\And finally, what tips the scale for me is the belief that we're smart enough to clean the air without breaking the bank. A system like cap and trade will create incentives for innovation, and the price of cleaning up our act will be far less than the dire predictions made by many conservatives.\Taking good care of the planet may not bring the overall economic boost that my son hopes for, but it will leave him a better, healthier world, and I owe him at least that much.\Credit: By John W.

\
A one-year-old regional experiment with carbon cap-and-trade has so far generated $13.5 million for energy conservation efforts in Maine.
\
But it could ultimately have a far bigger impact, in Maine and nationwide.
\
A much more ambitious cap-and-trade plan introduced to the U.S. Senate last week is based, at least in part, on the lessons learned here.
\
""The hope ... was that it would influence the national policy,"" said Thomas Tietenberg, a retired Colby College economics professor who helped develop Maine's piece of the program. ""And I think it did.""
\
Maine was one of 10 states to create the nation's first market-based system to fight climate change. By putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions, it encourages large power plants to become cleaner and more efficient.
\
It's too early to measure any effects on pollution or on electricity prices, especially given a recession that has reduced production -- and thus emissions -- far more than any government action.
\
The program has its flaws, including a cap on emissions that turned out to be too generous.
\
But it also is seen as an innovative way to fight climate change, and as a model.
\
""Clearly (it) has established that a cap and trade system can work and work very well in the United States,"" said David Littell, commissioner of Maine's Department of Environmental Protection. ""Before that, people were skeptical.""
\
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, was effectively launched in September 2008 with the first carbon allowance auction in the United States.
\
RGGI, which is pronounced ""reggie,"" requires large electricity producers in the Northeast to have one allowance for every ton of carbon dioxide they put into the atmosphere from burning coal, oil or gas.
\
The basic idea is that the power industry has a new incentive to shift to cleaner burning fuels, such as gas, and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that scientists say contribute to global warming.
\
The other principle behind cap-and-trade systems is that the number of overall allowances in the marketplace -- the cap -- will gradually be reduced over time.
\
ensuring across-the-board pollution reductions.
\
Trying to 'get it right'
\
RGGI is similar to a cap-and-trade system in Europe, with an American twist. The Europeans gave allowances away, while RGGI auctions them off to the highest bidders.
\
Ted Koffman, former House chairman of the Legislature's Natural Resources Committee, remembers how a visit from members of Britain's Parliament helped convince state officials in the Northeast to try something new.
\
""They felt they had failed because they gave away the allowances. It didn't create a market,"" said Koffman, who is now executive director of Maine Audubon. ""We felt if we got it right, we could help the nation get it right.""
\
Giving away allowances reduces the initial cost to the companies -- and to electric ratepayers -- but opens the door to unpredictable prices in the private trading market for allowances.
\
Auctioning off allowances sets a stable, and public, clearing price, while contributing to an increase in electricity costs. However, the Northeastern states decided to use the revenue generated by the auctions to pay for energy efficiency improvements, ranging from small residential projects to large industrial ones. That, according to economists, would eventually reduce the need for new power generating capacity and, as result, reduce electricity rates.
\
""The notion that you would auction off the allowances was a completely alien philosophy until RGGI,"" Tietenberg said.
\
In Maine, RGGI is expected to increase electricity costs about 1.5 percent over 10 years.
\
RGGI has so far held five electronic auctions of carbon allowances, with power plants and other investors paying a total of $432.7 million to the states.
\
Who buys the allowances, and how many they buy, is confidential under the rules set up by the states. Because the recession has led to such big price drops for oil and natural gas, any impact on electricity prices so far is unknown.
\
""The auctions have worked well,"" said Bill Cohen, a spokesman for Verso Paper, which has to buy allowances because it generates and sells power at mills in Bucksport and Jay. Cohen would not discuss how much the company has spent on the allowances, but said the program has not created any hardships.
\
""We didn't anticipate a whole lot of problems,"" he said. ""We had already made significant reductions in our CO2 output.""
\
Of the $13.5 million raised through the auctions of Maine's allowances, only $650,000 has been spent. It was allocated on an emergency basis last fall, when heating oil prices were approaching $5 a gallon, to weatherize the homes of low income Mainers.
\
The Maine State Housing Authority used the bulk of that money -- $500,000 -- to weatherize about 120 homes. The Passamaquoddy Tribe and Community Concepts Inc., a South Paris-based agency, shared the remainder.
\
Other RGGI funds are dedicated to a combination of energy efficiency programs, from incentives to promote compact fluorescent bulbs and energy efficient home appliances to large industrial projects valued between $100,000 and $1 million.
\
""It means now we have put programs in place that are helping our citizens and our consumers use energy more efficiently,"" said Michael Stoddard, deputy director of Environment Northeast, a Portland-based advocacy group. ""And that's going to serve us well when a new federal cap and trade system is implemented.""
\
The RGGI experiment hasn't been perfect, however.
\
What the critics say
\
The cap on the number of allowances was intentionally set high to start out so that it wouldn't immediately restrict emissions and raise the cost of allowances. Then the recession pushed energy production and emissions down farther.
\
Regulated emissions in the region are now believed to be about 20 percent below the overall cap. In Maine, the gap appears to be even bigger. Maine has about 6 million allowances to sell each year, but the six power plants that are covered by that cap only produced 3.6 million tons of carbon emissions last year, in part because of mild weather, according to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
\
That surplus of allowances is one reason that auction prices have declined since a year ago, from $3.51 per ton in a March auction to $2.19 in the latest auction last month. Uncertainty about a future national cap-and-trade program, and how RGGI allowances will fit in, also is keeping prices down, experts say.
\
Another criticism of RGGI has to do with the spending side.
\
Anthony Buxton, a Portland lawyer who represents paper mills and other large industrial electricity customers, said it is industry that faces the largest costs if auction revenue isn't used to reduce electricity use and prices. And, he said, the first use of money -- winterizing homes -- was a poor precedent.
\
""We were concerned that it would not be a program focused on cutting carbon but instead become a welfare program, and that in fact happened,"" Buxton said. ""We regard it as unconscionable that no money has gone out into some very valuable carbon-saving projects (in large industrial plants). If you're going to do something about climate change, you've got to take the best projects first.""
\
Officials with the Energy and Carbon Savings Trust, which oversees the auction proceeds, say it took time to create the new program, but that the money is coming. Last week, in fact, state officials announced a new $9 million grant program for large scale energy efficiency and renewable energy projects that will be paid for with auction proceeds and federal economic stimulus funds.
\
Shaping the debate
\
Given its strengths and weaknesses, it's not clear exactly how much of the RGGI concepts will end up in the national plan.
\
The congressional proposal does include auctions and the use of proceeds to promote energy efficiency, hallmarks of the RGGI program. However, most allowances would be given away in the beginning to reduce the immediate costs.
\
While officials in Maine and the other RGGI states want more use of auctions, they only dealt with one industry and a region that isn't reliant on the coal or oil industries. The federal plan would be much broader, going beyond power plants to include virtually all sources of emissions nationwide. Even motorists would effectively be covered because fuel importers would need to hold allowances.
\
The federal cap also would decline more aggressively and cover other heat trapping gases, such as methane, in addition to carbon dioxide.
\
Still, there is little doubt that Maine and the other RGGI states are shaping the debate.
\
""It's the only functioning compliance program in the United States right now,"" said Kathy Lee, a Maine-based global carbon markets consultant. ""You go to a carbon meeting internationally and everyone knows RGGI. ... People continue to look at it as a model. Not that it's perfect, but it's working.""
\
RGGI: LEADING THE WAY ON CAP-AND-TRADE
\
THE REGIONAL Greenhouse Gas Initiative, RGGI, requires large power-generating plants in 10 Northeastern states to buy one allowance for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the atmosphere, starting in 2009.
\
ALLOWANCES CAN be purchased at auctions directly from the states or from each other in the private market.
\
THE OVERALL NUMBER of allowances will be capped for six years and then gradually reduced by 10 percent by the end of 2018, making it increasingly expensive to pollute and forcing the dirtiest plants to improve or shut down. Maine and other states will use revenue from the sale of allowances to encourage energy efficiency and conservation.
\
THE 10 STATES participating are Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland.

10," President Bush will highlight efforts to protect natural resources during his Earth Day visit to Maine today, but he faces protests by environmentalists who say his administration's policies are polluting the state's air and water, and putting Mainers' health at risk.\ Bush is scheduled to give his annual Earth Day speech just before noon today at the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve. He is expected to talk about the role of citizen stewardship and conservation partnerships in protecting the country's natural resources.\ ""When we were collecting our short list of places that best demonstrate the spirit of partnership, the combination of the Wells Reserve, the Rachel Carson refuge and the Laudholm Trust Farm was high on our list as a great example of how that can work well,"" said James Connaughton, chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality and Bush's senior environmental adviser.\ Bush also will take a tour of the Wells reserve and do some water- quality sampling with volunteers.\ Maine environmentalists said the visit amounts to a ""greenwashing"" of Bush's environmental record - a record they say is regressive and harmful to public health. Several groups plan demonstrations outside the reserve to coincide with Bush's visit.\ ""What's deeply troubling is that this administration has undertaken a concerted, systematic, very vigorous effort to undermine or repeal every important environmental law protecting the people and the environment of the United States,"" said Brownie Carson, executive director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine.\ While not billed as a campaign stop by the White House, Bush's visit to Maine has political overtones. Maine is one of 18 so- called ""swing"" states in the presidential election. Sen. John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has spent the week attacking Bush on the environment.\ The issue that has perhaps received the most attention in Maine is clean air. More than 13 percent of Maine children have asthma, a problem that is exacerbated by air pollution that blows in from out- of-state industrial facilities. The state also has the second- highest rate of adult asthma in the country.\ Last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency listed more than 100 coastal Maine towns - including Wells - as places where there is a serious summer smog problem.\ Environmentalists have protested what they say is the Bush administration's weakening of a key provision of the Clean Air Act, requiring aging coal-fired power plants, oil refineries and other industrial facilities to upgrade pollution controls when the plants are modernized or expanded.\ Maine officials are fighting that weakening of the law through two lawsuits, and has filed a third lawsuit over the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions, which are a contributor to global warming.\ Bush's Clear Skies Initiative would eliminate the section of the Clean Air Act that lets states like Maine petition the EPA to crack down on out-of-state polluters, according to the Maine Attorney General's Office.\ ""I don't think since Sen. (Edmund) Muskie wrote the Clean Air Act that there has been a worse record by a president on air,"" said Conrad Schneider of the Clean Air Task Force in Brunswick.\ Connaughton called concerns over Bush's air policies ""misinformed."" He said new rules announced by the EPA last week will help Maine communities that are struggling with smog.\ ""We are moving forward with and implementing the new, much more stringent air quality standards to battle smog,"" he said. ""Later this year, we will be moving forward with new standards on fine particles. That's going to take us to a brand new, much stricter air pollution standard than we've ever had in the country before.""\ Connaughton also pointed to the new Interstate Air Quality Rule, which will require additional controls on power plants in 25 states that contribute to Maine's air pollution problem. The rule cuts down on emissions of nitrogen oxide, a pollutant that is a precursor to smog, and includes a cap-and-trade program.\ He also cited the new EPA rule that targets pollution from non- road diesel vehicles such as construction equipment and off-road farm equipment.\ Maine has filed comments with the EPA protesting its proposed new mercury rule, which officials say would allow coal-fired power plants to emit more mercury over a longer period of time than a previous EPA proposal.\ ""If the rule is finalized as it's currently proposed, it's likely a significant number of states would file a lawsuit about that, including Maine,"" said Assistant Attorney General Jerry Reid.\ Mercury is a toxic contaminant that has been linked with neurological and developmental problems. Maine has statewide advisories that caution children under 8 and women of child-bearing age not to eat more than one fish meal a month from Maine waters.\ Connaughton said Bush committed to cutting mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants as soon as he entered office in 2001.\ ""As we sit here today, there is no regulation of mercury from power plants,"" he said. ""What we have proposed is a 70 percent cut in the mercury pollution from power plants, and we have proposed two different ways of getting there.""\ The Bush administration prefers a market-based approach that creates an incentive for facilities to reduce pollution earlier and more than legally required, he said.\ But environmentalists say that taking 15 years or more to reduce mercury pollution is too long, and they prefer the earlier EPA proposal that would cut mercury pollution by 90 percent, with a target compliance date of 2008.\ Environmentalists are also upset about Bush administration policies that exempt the Defense Department from laws protecting marine mammals and endangered species. And they say there has been a 40 percent drop in federal prosecution of criminal pollution cases.\ Environmentalists contend that taxpayers, instead of polluters, are being forced to pay for cleaning up toxic Superfund sites. Fewer toxic waste sites are being added to the national priorities list, they say, and others - including the Eastland Woolen Mill in Corinna - are taking longer to clean up.\ Wetlands such as those found on the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve are also in trouble, said Maureen Drouin, Northeast regional representative of the Sierra Club.\ ""Wetlands and small streams filter pollutants out of our water,"" she said. ""But the Bush administration has eliminated Clean Water Act protections from 20 million acres of wetlands.""\ Kate Moffat of Kennebunk, a teacher, said the Wells reserve is one of her favorite places to spend her free time. She said to have President Bush at the reserve on Earth Day ""is an insult.""\ ""I was kind of upset that he is literally coming to our back yard on Earth Day, because his environmental record is just awful,"" she said. ""It just feels to me like he's trying to look green for a day by coming up here to this beautiful spot.""\ But Jonathan Reisman, associate professor of economics and public policy at the University of Maine in Machias, said he believes Bush's policies are important for a healthy economy. He accused environmental groups of playing on people's fears when they talk about issues.\ ""The reality is the air and water are substantially cleaner than they were 30 years ago, but you wouldn't know it by listening to our environmental groups,"" he said.\ Staff Writer Meredith Goad can be contacted at 791-6332 or at:\ mgoad@pressherald.com"
11," The message to the Environmental Protection Agency, coming from states, members of Congress and the public, is clear: Rules proposed by the Bush administration to reduce mercury pollution fall short of what is necessary to protect human health and the environment. Instead, the agency should move forward with a more stringent rule developed by the previous administration.\ Rather than adopting regulations requiring the installation of maximum achievable control technology (MACT) as required by the Clean Air Act, the agency late last year proposed a new cap-and- trade program that would allow power plants to buy and sell the right to emit mercury, a potent neurotoxin. MACT would have reduced mercury emissions 90 percent by 2008. The cap-and-trade rules, which allows companies that cannot reduce their share of mercury emissions to pay for cuts at other facilities, would result in a 70 percent reduction by 2018.\ Officials at power plants, refineries and factories have said they cannot meet the MACT requirements. That contention was countered last year by testimony from industry before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. A study by the National Environmental Trust analyzed federal data and concluded that ""50 power plants, with about 150 boiler units, are already achieving mercury emissions reductions of at least 90 percent, without even installing the best controls.""\ The Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, an association of state air quality control divisions, last fall concluded, ""Toxic mercury emissions from power plants could be reduced by over 90 percent - from 48 tons annually down to only 7 tons - through a combination of benefits achieved from existing air pollution controls and utilization of commercially available mercury reduction technologies ... without undue economic burden.""\ The EPA's own analysis of the rules has been delayed by political appointees at the agency. Further, language in the new rule was taken directly from memos on the subject written by lawyers representing the regulated industries and an advisory committee charged with providing the EPA with feedback on regulatory alternatives was disbanded without explanation earlier this year, according to media reports.\ EPA administrator Michael Leavitt has said he will re-evaluate the cap-and-trade plan. He'll have plenty to evaluate. More than 540,000 comments have been filed on the plan. Among them are strong opposition from 11 states, including Maine. The states, which also include California, New Mexico and Wisconsin, argue that the rule favored by the Bush administration favors power company interests at the expense of public health. A group of 45 senators, including Maine's, have also asked the agency to withdraw the rule in favor of the MACT approach.\ In her comments to the EPA, Sen. Susan Collins noted that data collected by the agency shows that existing technologies can reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants by 98 percent or more. ""In inexplicably, the proposed Utility Mercury Reductions Rule does not reflect this technological capability,"" she wrote. Environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Council of Maine have sued the agency, saying the cap-and-trade rules violate the Clean Air Act.\ After evaluating all the data, the agency must adopt the rule that will accomplish the largest reduction in mercury emissions in the shortest period of time."

AUGUSTA - It's been a champion year for the environment in the Legislature, advocates and legislators said Tuesday.
\
Six significant bills have passed, said Maureen Drouin, executive director of the Maine League of Conservation Voters.
\
Communities along the Androscoggin River stand to benefit from the state bond package, which allocates $20 million for infrastructure improvements to state parks, historic sites and riverfront recreational, tourism and community facilities. The money would also support downtown revitalization and expansion of tourism and Maine's ""creative economy.""
\
Another $17 million state bond is earmarked for the Land for Maine's Future program to continue conservation efforts.
\
""I've seen firsthand their (LMF) efficient staff at work during the past 15 years and am impressed with their thorough processes and citizen involvement with willing sellers of special lands,"" said bill sponsor Rep. Patrick Flood, R-Winthrop.
\
The bonds are pending voter approval, and would be distributed through grant requests.
\
Also noted during a news conference Tuesday were two of the most publicized issues of the session.
\
Gov. John Baldacci on Monday signed the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative into law. The bill, being discussed in nine other states, seeks to control greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide) through a cap-and-trade system. Under such a system, power plants are offered financial incentives to cap the emission of carbon dioxide and other pollutants.
\
Baldacci also recently put his signature on a bill phasing out use of the flame retardant deca from furniture and electronics.
\
Wildlife habitat and endangered species also got a look. A bill by Rep. Ted Koffman, D-Bar Harbor, clarifies and makes technical changes to the Natural Resources Protection Laws regarding significant wildlife habitat.
\
A bill by Rep. Mark Bryant, D-Windham, will update the list of state endangered species. The bill was signed at the end of May.
\
Some of the species added to the list were the New England cottontail, short-eared owl and boreal snaketail.

13," Coal-fueled power plants are the nation's largest contributor of airborne mercury, a toxin so potent that relatively small amounts can damage the nervous system, the heart, kidneys and liver in adults as well as cause serious brain-development damage in a fetus or young child. Removing this toxin, however, became more difficult as the smokestack emissions became mixed with politics in the Bush administration, which sought to delay and loosen standards for mercury.\ Former EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman said recently that she was unaware during her tenure that crucial analyses of mercury removal were delayed by political appointees at the agency, according to a story in the Los Angeles Times. They were due last December, but career staff members were prevented from getting them done by political appointees, according to the story. Those analyses would, among other things, model the feasibility and cost of installing maximum achievable control technology (MACT) to meet standards for reducing emissions, something the industry, which is said to have helped write the agency's current proposal for mercury pollution control, did not want.\ The current EPA administrator, Michael O. Leavitt, said his agency would conduct further analysis in preparation for adopting a final rule in December. This is encouraging, but the agency has not yet classified mercury under its hazardous air pollutant standards, which would require MACT standards rather than the less stringent limits for other pollutants under cap-and-trade rules.\ Mr. Leavitt prefers the cap-and-trade model, which focuses more on outcomes than process for reducing pollutants, and his office points to the difficulties of applying a single technology to all power plants and to the absence of any technology that would produce reductions on the scale contemplated by the Clean Air Act. But the current cap-and-trade proposal envisions far lesser reductions - 70 percent reduction by 2018 - than what the Clean Air Act would require under MACT - a 90 percent reduction by 2007. Further, cap and trade doesn't eliminate ""hot spots"" of mercury, places of increased deposition from plants that have purchased mercury credits.\ As to whether the Clean Air Act reductions are possible, the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, an association of state air quality control divisions, last fall concluded, ""Toxic mercury emissions from power plants could be reduced by over 90 percent - from 48 tons annually down to only 7 tons - through a combination of benefits achieved from existing air pollution controls and utilization of commercially available mercury reduction technologies ... without undue economic burden.""\ Testimony from industry last year before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works also supported these reductions. And so did a study by the National Environmental Trust. Using federal data, it concluded that ""50 power plants, with about 150 boiler units, are already achieving mercury emissions reductions of at least 90 percent, without even installing the best controls.""\ .\ Mr. Leavitt did not create the delays at the EPA and deserves the benefit of the doubt in Congress, but he inherited an agency that repeatedly withheld key information or failed to perform tests that may have pointed toward increased regulation. Sen. Susan Collins, who with Sen. Olympia Snowe and many other senators, wants the MACT standards to be used for mercury, recently noted the EPA itself in 2001 described current technologies that could reduce emissions from coal-fired plants by 99 percent for new sources and 98 percent for existing sources. ""Inexplicably,"" she wrote to Mr. Leavitt, ""the proposed Utility Mercury Reductions Rule does not reflect this technological capability.""\ House Democrats would go even further. After reading a new EPA advisory concluding the estimated number of infants exposed to high levels of mercury is likely double the 320,000 previously believed, Rep. Tom Allen joined others in requesting an investigation by the EPA inspector general ""into allegations of undue industry influence in the rule-making process.""\ This is a difficult request in an area of policy where Democrats hope to highlight the president's weaknesses. But given the lack of cooperation from the administration, members of Congress have few other options. Mr. Leavitt seems to understand this entirely, and should promote cooperation with Congress and take steps to dramatically toughen the agency's mercury standards to meet the rules of the Clean Air Act."

WASHINGTON - Mainers, from environmentalists to members of Congress, lauded a federal appeals court decision Friday that struck down a Bush administration policy allowing some power plants to exceed mercury emission levels. The court ruled that the government failed to consider the policy's effect on public health and the environment.
\
Maine and 13 other states sued to block the Bush regulation, saying it would allow dangerous levels of mercury into the environment. The toxic metal is known to contaminate seafood that, when eaten, can damage the developing brains of fetuses and young children.
\
""This ruling represents a significant victory for both the health of Maine people and our natural environment,"" Maine Attorney General Steven Rowe said in a statement Friday. ""The courts have rejected a Bush administration attempt to put the profits of corporate polluters above the health of the American people.""
\
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia negated a rule known as cap-and-trade. That policy allows power plants that fail to meet emission targets to buy credits from plants that did, rather than having to install their own mercury emissions controls. The rule was to go into effect in 2010.
\
The three-judge court unanimously struck down the cap-and-trade policy and the federal Environmental Protection Agency's plan to exempt coal- and oil-fired power plants from regulations requiring strict emissions control technology to block emissions. Before instituting the new regulation, the court held, the government was required to show that emissions from any power plant would not harm the environment or ""exceed a level which is adequate to protect public health with an ample margin of safety.""
\
The EPA argued it was not required to follow that rule, a stance the court held was ""not persuasive.""
\
The agency defended the rule, saying it represented the nation's first attempt to control such emissions and that it would reduce mercury emissions by 70 percent.
\
""Keep in mind, the U.S. now has no national mercury emissions regulation for these plants,"" EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said, adding that the EPA would consider whether the cap-and-trade policy could be resurrected under a different regulation. ""It's good for America and it's good for the environment. We want to be a global leader on this issue,"" he said.
\
Industry organizations strongly supported the plan.
\
""The court's decision represents a major setback for federal efforts to establish clear mercury regulations for coal-fired power plants,"" said Dan Riedinger, a spokesman for Edison Electric Institute, an association of power companies. ""Now EPA has to go back to the drawing board, pushing mercury regulations far off into the future.""
\
High mercury levels in the state's fish, loon and eagle populations prompted the Maine Bureau of Health to issue a statewide advisory in 1994 to limit fish consumption for pregnant women and young children. The advisory remains in effect because mercury levels have not diminished sufficiently.
\
""This is good news for every family in America,"" said Matt Prindiville of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, one of four environmental organizations involved in the case. ""It means that someday our kids will be able to eat the fish they catch from our lakes and rivers.""
\
Mercury is a powerful neurotoxin. The National Academy of Sciences estimates that 60,000 newborns a year could be at risk of learning disabilities because of mercury their mothers absorbed during pregnancy. About 8 percent of U.S. women of child-bearing age have enough mercury in their blood to cause concern for a future pregnancy.
\
Members of Maine's congressional delegation all support the federal court decision.
\
""Maine's environment should not be for sale to the lowest bidder,"" Republican U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe said. ""Today's decision underscores the lunacy of having a standard that allows plants to purchase their way out of compliance.""
\
Snowe and U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, sent a letter to the EPA last November, along with other senators from the Northeast, in a bipartisan effort to expedite mercury emission reductions. Collins has also co-sponsored a bill with U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn., that would create nationwide mercury monitoring sites.
\
Democratic Reps. Tom Allen and Mike Michaud of Maine joined the senators in approving the court decision.
\
""The court has affirmed what Tom has said all along: The Bush rules do not comply with the Clean Air Act,"" Allen's spokesman, Mark Sullivan, said Friday.
\
Maine has taken great steps to reduce mercury, but continues to suffer because of out-of-state pollution, Michaud said.

15," Members of Maine's congressional delegation are calling for tougher limits on mercury emissions and the establishment of a monitoring program in response to new evidence of heavily contaminated ""hot spots"" in Maine and other Northeastern states.\ Researchers who spent three years testing yellow perch and loons across the Northeast have identified five areas where mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants and other sources accumulated to levels considered unsafe for animals and for humans.\ The findings were published in the January issue of the scientific journal BioScience and presented publicly Tuesday by the lead authors.\ One hot spot cited in the study spans the upper Androscoggin River and Kennebec River watersheds in western Maine.\ A lead author of the report, David Evers, is executive director of the BioDiversity Research Institute in Gorham. The study was coordinated and financed in part by the Hubbard Brook Research Foundation, a nonprofit forest research organization based in New Hampshire.\ Evers said the research demonstrates a need for ongoing monitoring to protect people from exposure to mercury, which is toxic to the nervous system. Maine and 43 other states already warn residents, especially children and pregnant women, to limit their consumption of fish caught in inland rivers and lakes.\ ""We found fish in remote areas of Maine with mercury levels four times higher than the (federal) human health criterion,"" Evers said. ""We believe people need to know where these highly polluted lakes exist so that they can take appropriate precautions when choosing where to fish and whether or not to consume that fish.""\ Evers and the other authors said the study raises concerns about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's plans for a ""cap-and- trade system"" to reduce mercury emissions. The system would let power companies decide if they want to clean up their emissions or pay another to cut back its pollution. Critics fear the system would let older, dirtier plants keep pumping mercury into the environment.\ The EPA issued a formal response to the study Tuesday.\ ""Under the Bush Administration, the U.S. is the first nation in the world to regulate mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants,"" the agency said. It projects an 80 percent reduction in mercury deposition across the Northeast.\ The EPA, while not promising it will monitor fish or loons, said it is working to establish a nationwide network of atmospheric mercury monitoring sites to estimate how much mercury is settling onto the ground or into waterways.\ Maine's congressional delegation has been united in favor of more aggressive cutbacks in mercury emissions.\ Aides for Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Rep. Tom Allen, D- Maine, said both will keep pushing for Congress to write tougher mercury restrictions. Both also now plan to submit new legislation calling for monitoring of mercury in the environment.\ Collins issued a statement Tuesday saying the study makes it clear that the EPA should not rely only on computer models to protect people from the risks. ""I have long-argued that EPA used faulty science in order to justify an insufficient mercury rule, and these studies prove it,"" said Collins, who is calling for a 90 percent reduction in mercury emissions.\ Scott Segal, a lawyer for the electricity industry, said a 90 percent cut is not feasible without switching from coal to an energy source such as natural gas, which is far more expensive.\ Segal also said the latest research should prompt support for the EPA cap-and-trade program, not criticism of it, because it will encourage the dirtiest plants to clean up fastest.\ ""Only a cap-and-trade program ensures faster reductions at the higher emissions,"" Segal said. ""If you have a high-emitting plant, you have an economic incentive to improve faster.""\ Staff Writer John Richardson can be contacted at 791-6324 or at:\ jrichardson@pressherald.com"

Environmental coalitions support state's entry into cap-and-trade agreement
\
After weeks of lost logging opportunities because of unfrozen ground, Eliot Jordan, a third generation owner of a Maine logging company, told newspapers in January, ""These stretches of warm weather are not normal, and we are losing time. This is the second year in a row...We need cold weather; and a stretch of it. It's becoming a big issue for us.""
\
Mainers know our climate is changing. We are increasingly educated about the growing number of scientific reports on the effects of global warming. And we are aware of the changes in seasons right here in Maine. We recently experienced the warmest December on record, a real problem not just for ski areas and loggers, but for a whole host of small businesses that rely on winter recreation. Coastal towns are already losing ground to rising seas. Asthma rates are high and rising and Lyme Disease is spreading north.
\
Scientists tell us that without a real change in course, these trends will increase tenfold. What can little Maine do? A lot. Two years ago, Gov. John Baldacci signed an agreement with other states in the northeast to put a mandatory cap on global warming pollution from power plants. If this ten-state partnership were its own country, it would be the seventh largest emitter of global warming pollution in the world. Nearly 40 percent of this pollution comes from power plants.
\
The agreement signed by our governor, known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative or RGGI, also requires emissions to go down by 10 percent by 2020. This all adds up to a big impact, and Maine should be part of it.
\
RGGI uses a market-based mechanism to achieve global warming reductions in the most cost-effective way possible. It establishes a fixed supply of emissions ""credits"" and requires power plants to hold a credit for every ton they emit. Power plants have complete flexibility about whether, and how, to reduce emissions. If emissions reductions aren't feasible, they can buy credits from other power plants that make extra reductions. This flexibility is good for energy consumers, and the mandatory reductions are good for the environment.
\
""Cap and trade"" programs like RGGI are already working effectively to reduce acid rain and ozone pollution. This model is being used by the European Union to reduce global warming. One thing we have learned from other applications of this model is that policymakers can auction off these credits to power plants. Most RGGI states are choosing to auction credits and use the revenue to benefit energy consumers.
\
The best way to benefit energy consumers is with energy efficiency - improvements in our homes and businesses that dramatically reduce our demand for electricity, and how much we pay. The Public Utilities Commission, the Public Advocate, and economists across the region agree with this approach.
\
Maine currently invests less in energy efficiency than any other state in New England. We are wasting much more energy than we need to. The good news is that we have a big reservoir of energy efficiency that we can tap into at very low costs. Efficiency costs 60 percent less per kilowatt-hour than having to produce additional electricity at a power plant, and it causes zero pollution.
\
Research across the region and in Maine shows that RGGI plus energy efficiency will save Mainers about $90 million over the length of the program - in other words, RGGI could actually lower utility bills by 5 percent or more.
\
Energy efficiency investments are good for another reason: they are capital investments that are screwed in, nailed on, and bolted down in Maine, and they stay in Maine. Savings from energy efficiency allow businesses to prosper and expand; a winning recipe for Maine jobs. Many, many businesses are already investing in energy efficiency, but there are obstacles, so incentives are a key ingredient in boosting their investment.
\
One strong RGGI bill, LD 1090, already has bipartisan support. The governor and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection have been working with stakeholders to draft their own bill. RGGI is the most important thing we can do about global warming, and all eyes will be on the legislature to ensure that we adopt this program and do the right thing for our climate and our economy.Dylan Voorhees is the Clean Energy Director for the National Resources Council of Maine.

18," State legislators have enacted a bill banning a potentially hazardous chemical used in household products and are poised to approve a measure enrolling Maine in a regional compact on climate change.\ On Tuesday, the Senate voted 32-2 to approve a bill, LD 1658, that bans the sale of new televisions and other plastic-encased electronics made with the chemical flame retardant known as deca. The ban goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2010, although a ban on the sale of mattresses made with deca begins next year.\ Supporters of the legislation, which was sponsored by House Majority Leader Hannah Pingree, D-North Haven, claim the ban is necessary to protect the public from a chemical linked to development and neurological problems in laboratory animals.\ Deca is the most common flame retardant used in televisions today. The chemical's critics say equally effective but safer alternatives are available. The bill had the support of Professional Firefighters of Maine, the Maine Fire Chiefs Association, the state fire marshal and the Maine Fire Protection Services Commission, as well as environmental and health organizations.\ ""We've performed exhaustive studies on deca for years,"" Pingree said in a statement. ""There's no question that the chemical is harmful to women and children, animals and the environment. It has no place in Maine homes, and we hope that other states will follow our lead in moving toward safer alternatives.""\ Deca manufacturers opposed the bill, claiming the chemical is safe and effective.\ Also Tuesday, the Senate gave initial approval to a bill that would enroll Maine in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10- state compact aimed at reducing the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by power plants.\ The Senate endorsed the measure, LD 1851, by a unanimous vote. The House voted 120-7 in support of the bill last week. Gov. John Baldacci has indicated strong support for Maine's participation in the initiative.\ Known as RGGI, or ""Reggie,"" the compact caps emissions of carbon dioxide - a primary culprit in global warming - from fossil fuel- burning power plants beginning in 2009 and then requires a 10 percent reduction by 2019. Six power producers in Maine will be regulated by the bill.\ The bill also establishes a regional carbon trading system in which companies can buy or sell carbon ""credits."" Supporters hope RGGI, the nation's first multistate compact on carbon dioxide, will serve as a model for any future federal cap-and-trade program dealing with greenhouse gases."
19," If the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency needs more evidence that a Bush administration plan to reduce mercury pollution misses the target, it got it this week with its own report on the increasing number of water bodies across the country that are contaminated with the toxic heavy metal. The report reiterates that the agency should move ahead with more stringent mercury emission rules required under the Clean Air Act instead of a cap-and-trade program proposed by the administration.\ EPA administrator Michael Leavitt recently put the cap-and-trade program on hold so he can re-evaluate it. His agency's report, which found that the number of water bodies with fish contamination advisories due to high levels of mercury increased almost 10 percent between 2002 and 2003, must be added to the many documents the administrator will review. According to the report, more than 3,000 lakes and rivers were under fish consumption advisories, with 280 new water bodies added last year. In Maine, 19 rivers and lakes have been under such advisories for a decade.\ The advisories typically warn pregnant women and young children not to eat more than a specified number of fish from fresh water sources in a month. All other freshwater species are off-limits to pregnant and nursing women, women who may get pregnant, and children under 8, because of the high risk; everyone else can have two meals a month, according to Maine's fish advisories. A federal advisory recommends that children and nursing and pregnant women eat only two 6-ounce meals a week of low-mercury fish like canned tuna, salmon, shrimp, pollock and catfish.\ EPA officials say that the increasing number of contaminated lakes and rivers is due to the fact that state and federal regulators are looking harder for mercury in water bodies. This may be partially true, but it also shows that rules aimed at keeping mercury out of the environment in the first place must be strengthened.\ Dropping the administration's mercury emissions rule in favor of tougher regulations requiring the installation of maximum achievable control technology (MACT), as required by the Clean Air Act, is a good place to start. MACT would reduce mercury emissions by 90 percent by 2008. The administration's cap-and-trade rules, which would allow companies that cannot reduce their share of mercury emissions to pay for cuts at other facilities, would result in a 70 percent reduction by 2018. Industry testimony before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, as well as that from environmental groups, confirms that the MACT rule can be implemented without undue economic burden.\ The evidence is mounting that this approach, which will accomplish the largest reduction in mercury emissions in the shortest period of time, should be adopted."

Time to drop this ""war on coal"" talk. Time to ignore the hollering by coal country politicians over President Obama's beefed-up plan to combat global warming.
\
No, the Clean Power Plan will not ruin their local economies, because coal has already done that, certainly in Appalachia. Look at those barren flats where majestic mountains once stood. The coal industry lopped off the mountaintops and fouled the streams, depriving West Virginia and eastern Kentucky of a key recruiting tool for modern employers prizing a healthy environment.
\
But let's not go overly negative here. Coal did its job. It powered 20th-century America. The Appalachian coal regions gave and gave. We honor their sacrifice.
\
So rather than call the new plan a war on coal, let us call it a retirement party for coal. Coal is the largest source of planet-warming gases. It must make room for 21st-century power.
\
Mother Nature has already offered us a foretaste of what she has in mind should global warming go unchecked. Higher temperatures have worsened drought in the West, igniting large swaths of California, Washington and Oregon.
\
Glacier National Park in northern Montana may sound like a cool, watery place. But tourists there have been abandoning their cars to flee wildfires. The glaciers themselves are melting and may be gone in 30 years.
\
Flooding in other parts of the country is part of the same climate phenomenon.
\
Natural gas emits about half as much carbon as does coal and can transition us to truly clean power. But the future is clearly renewable energy from such sources as the sun and wind.
\
The new rules push us in that direction. They will require utilities to generate at least 28 percent of their electric power from renewable sources by 2030. (Renewables accounted for only 13 percent last year.)
\
This is not mission impossible. In 2011, California mandated that 33 percent of its electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2020. California's economy is booming -- aided no doubt by all that clean-energy venture capital (almost 60 percent of America's total) flowing into the state.
\
Obama's plan promotes a cap-and-trade system. States place a limit on greenhouse gases and let businesses buy and sell permits to emit them. This market-based approach started off as a conservative idea. Do remember that when the opposition rails against the idea as ""cap and tax.""
\
California already has a cap-and-trade system, and 10 other states have followed suit. At least 30 other states also have mandates for renewable energy.
\
Foes will no doubt bash the Clean Power Plan as radical, but the public should know that even these stricter regulations will not save us from global warming. They will only stop a free fall into planetary catastrophe.
\
What about other countries? A reasonable question. The plan will give Obama something serious to unfurl at the climate change summit this December in Paris. When the United States offers a plausible blueprint to meet the challenge, other countries, notably China, will be pressed to follow suit.
\
And what about the coal regions? Appalachia has considerable natural beauty left, a great location and plenty of water. Coal-producing Wyoming has its own attractions, some quite magnificent.
\
Coal is yesterday's fuel. Give it a respectful goodbye and dry the tears.

21," A Maine-based environmental policy group released a regional plan Monday that its authors said would dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in New England and eastern Canada while setting a national precedent on energy policy.\ Representatives of Environment Northeast said implementation of the more than two dozen recommendations in their ""Climate Change Roadmap"" could yield a 75 percent reduction in regional emissions linked to global warming by 2050. In terms of total tonnage, that would translate into reducing emissions from 345 million metric tons of emissions to 86 million metric tons.\ That is consistent with a 2001 goal set by the governors of the six New England states and five eastern Canadian provinces.\ The report seeks to capture all sectors of the economy, including industry, government and everyday shoppers. The recommendations range from tougher efficiency standards for appliances to more- stringent emission standards for new power plants and hefty state investment in biofuels.\ While some of the recommendations would require significant regulatory changes - such as new emissions standards for vehicles - other proposals are based on policies already in place in some but not all areas of the region.\ Working together, the Northeastern states could shape the national policies likely on the horizon as the U.S. seeks to reduce its contribution to the global warming problem, the authors said.\ ""We really have the opportunity to set the direction for the rest of the country,"" said Michael Stoddard, project director for Environment Northeast, a Portland-based environmental research and advocacy group.\ The organization's 275-page report is the first to recommend an energy policy agenda for all of New England and the eastern Canadian provinces.\ The recommendations fall under three categories: energy, transportation and sequestration, the term used for the removal and storage of atmospheric carbon.\ Stoddard said Maine is setting the example in some areas. For example, the group recommends that states and provinces follow Maine's lead in requiring that all new state buildings exceed energy codes by 20 percent.\ But like all other states, Maine still could be more aggressive in other areas, such as energy efficiency and transportation, he said.\ ""The state of Maine needs to start implementing these kinds of measures and stop the hand-wringing about the need to do more studies or more pilot projects,"" Stoddard said.\ Other recommendations include:\ . Adopt minimum efficiency standards for appliances and update standards for furnaces.\ . Offer incentives to create combined heat and power operations that reuse heat from electricity generation.\ . Shift state policies to encourage construction and integration into the power grid of renewable energy sources, such as wind or biomass, while discouraging construction of coal-burning plants.\ . Increase regional collaboration to fund and develop biomass fuel opportunities from wood and other fiber-based sources.\ . Shift 10 percent of all truck freight to rail or waterways by 2015.\ Stoddard said his group strongly supports the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade system that requires major fossil- fuel-burning power plants to reduce emissions. But he said Maine and the other member states eventually should expand the program to cover other pollution sources and greenhouse gases.\ David Littell, commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, said Monday evening that he had read through a summary of the report but had yet to review the list of recommendations. Littell called what he did read ""very informative"" and predicted it would be useful to lawmakers, DEP staff and the general public as Maine continues to develop its greenhouse gas reduction policies."

In a new Gallup Poll asking who is the national leader of the Republican Party, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels didn't even rate an asterisk. That's unsurprising. The governor of the country's 16th most populous state won't normally garner much national attention, especially when he's an unassuming, old-school budget cutter.
\
It's also a shame, because more than any other Republican officeholder, Daniels points the way ahead for his bedraggled party. He's a Reaganite who's not trapped in 1980s nostalgia; he's a fiscal conservative who believes not just in limiting government, but in reforming it to address people's everyday concerns; he's a politician of principle who refuses to sell his program in off-puttingly partisan or ideological terms.
\
As they grapple with President Barack Obama, Republicans at the national level could do worse than ask themselves: What would Daniels do?
\
At a recent forum in Washington sponsored by the Bradley Foundation and Hudson Institute, Daniels noted that Ralph Waldo Emerson said every polity tends to have a party of memory and a party of hope. ""Hope"" has of late become a kind of swearword for conservatives, so Daniels could have been expected to be winding up for a jab at Obama. Instead, he said, ""We must be, as we have been in our better days, our more successful days, a party of hope.""
\
Daniels went on to give a plug for empathy as an animating attitude for the GOP: ""We must not only assert, but assert with credibility, that we understand what is going on in the lives of everyday people."" His pitch included a plug for Republicans directing themselves ""almost entirely to the young people of this country."" In Indiana, Daniels explained, the GOP is ""the party of purpose,"" arrayed against Democrats who are ""reactionary"" and ""negative"" - ""everything we must not be, as we address national events.""
\
If this sounds like a call for a mushy me-tooism, it isn't. When Daniels took office, the state had an $800 million deficit. He turned it into a $1.3 billion surplus (although it will be eaten into in the current downturn). Since 2005, he's saved roughly $450 million in the state's budget and reduced the state's rate of spending growth from 5.9 percent to 2.8 percent. ""I tell you with certainty,"" Daniels told his Washington audience, ""concern about the debt and deficit has not gone out of style.""
\
""Mitch the Knife,"" as he was nick-named when he headed George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget, has matched his fiscal probity with the restless innovation of a devoted policy entrepreneur. He leased the state's faltering toll road to a European operator for nearly $4 billion. He created health savings accounts for Indiana's poor. He deregulated telecommunications. And he attracted business to the state, with Indiana winning more foreign investment than any other state during the past two years.
\
A populist outcry against the toll-road deal dragged Daniels approval rating down to 37 percent at one point, and his tenure seemed a warning against putting a tightfisted technocrat in elected office. But opinion turned. He won re-election by 18 points last year. He won 20 percent of the black vote, and beat his Democratic opponent among voters under age 30 by 7 points.
\
Daniels counsels national Republicans to adopt a ""no, but"" approach. As he told an interviewer from National Journal, on cap-and-trade he'd say: ""No, let's not double the tax on poor people in the vain hope of moving the world's thermometer. Here's a way to conserve energy and protect the environment that doesn't impoverish the nation."" On health care, he'd say, ""Sure, let's get people covered with health insurance, but here's a much better way.""
\
His success has stoked speculation about a possible 2012 presidential run. Daniels has made Shermanesque disavowals of national ambitions, and expressed confidence that new national leaders will soon emerge. When they do, they should heed the lesson and message of Mitch Daniels, an exemplar of a winning conservatism.Rich Lowry is a syndicated columnist.

23,"
From the moment he was declared the winner in his re-election campaign, Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., has been billed as a new kind of Republican. Is it a fair characterization? Yes and no.
\
Yes, this likely presidential candidate has done a few things other GOP politicians don't usually do. Yes, he has won re-election in a traditionally Democratic state. And yes, for a few weeks he was actually cordial to President Obama. Even considering the context -- he only won against an underfunded opponent and he was only nice to the president when asking for hurricane relief funds -- these are, indeed, rare accomplishments for a Republican.
\
That said, these atypical parts of Christie's record have little to do with the concrete policies that he has touted and that he would probably champion if he were elected president. On that score, Christie isn't new at all. He is the opposite -- a Bush/Cheney-esque neoconservative promoting the old politics of division and ignorance.
\
Take, for instance, Christie's declarations about civil liberties.
\
A few months ago, Christie alluded to 9/11 when calling criticism of the National Security Administration ""dangerous."" Then, in truly Cheney-esque fashion, he warned that ""the next attack that comes, that kills thousands of Americans as a result, people are going to be looking back."" Christie's insinuation, of course, was that if America is hit again, it will rightly blame those who dared to question the NSA's mass surveillance programs.
\
Yet, in his eagerness to instill fear, Christie failed to address the serious constitutional concerns about the NSA programs. Worse, he didn't mention that, as ProPublica recently reported, ""there is no evidence"" that such surveillance has stopped terrorist attacks or is making the country safer.
\
It is a similar situation when it comes to budget issues. Christie has pushed a Bush-like agenda of tax breaks for the wealthy and cuts to social services, education and retirement benefits. He has portrayed this agenda as proof that he is fearlessly ""advocating for the taxpayer."" Yet, as the New York Times recently reported, Christie has also channeled Bush by cheerily handing out hundreds of millions of dollars worth of wasteful taxpayer subsidies to huge corporations.
\
Then there is the fight against climate change. It should be a cause Christie passionately endorses, considering the ample evidence that climate change is intensifying storms, like the 2012 hurricane that pummeled his state. Instead, like a standard-issue Republican politician, he is in the climate-change denial camp.
\
As the Newark Star-Ledger notes, Christie has ""been a catastrophe on the environment, draining $1 billion from clean energy funds and calling a cease-fire in the state's fight against climate change."" More specifically, Mother Jones magazine reports that Christie ""got rid of the Office of Climate Change and Energy within the Department of Environmental Protection shortly after taking office, withdrew the state from the Northeast's cap and trade plan known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (and) weakened the state's renewable energy standard."" Meanwhile, when a local radio correspondent asked him about the scientific connection between climate change and superstorms, Christie angrily brushed off the query by declaring that ""liberal public radio always has an agenda.""
\
As he prepares to run for president, Christie is betting that his dangerously outdated policy agenda will be obscured by his seemingly novel style. He is betting, in other words, that the media will ignore his record, fetishize his bluster and thus shower him with all the cliches (""tough,"" ""determined,"" ""straight talking,"" etc.) that tend to dominate presidential campaign coverage.
\
It is certainly a cynical bet. But it is not a stupid one in an era that so often replaces inquiry with hagiography and makes the old seem new again.

24,"MERCURY IMPACTS Coal- and oil-fired power plants account for more than 40 percent of the country's mercury emissions. Maine is one of 44 states that have issued fish-consumption advisories because of mercury content. Maine loons have some of the highest levels of mercury in their blood in the country.\ The Natural Resources Council of Maine, the National Wildlife Federation and the Izaak Walton League are suing the Environmental Protection Agency over its proposed mercury pollution standards.\ The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., claims the EPA is violating the Clean Air Act by refusing to adopt pollution standards that best protect public health and the environment from mercury emitted by power plants.\ The EPA announced its first-ever mercury rules in December, but environmentalists say the emissions cuts the agency proposed do not go far enough and would take too long to achieve results.\ ""We think they're flat-out wrong,"" said Jon Hinck, toxics project director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine. ""Up until December, we assumed the EPA would make a good-faith effort to comply (with the Clean Air Act), and the signs are otherwise.""\ The lawsuit comes just before the EPA's April 30 deadline for public comment on the rules.\ Hinck said the conservation groups wanted to take action before the end of the public comment period ""just in case they use the argument that we had the opportunity in the comment period to make this claim and that it's really too late.""\ ""We didn't want to take that chance,"" he said.\ The lawsuit seeks a court-ordered judgment that the Clean Air Act requires the most protective mercury standard, as well as an ""expeditious"" schedule for issuing that standard.\ Cynthia Bergman, a spokesperson for EPA in Washington, D.C., said lawsuits have already led to years of delay on the mercury issue, ""and more litigation is only going to tie things up and prevent us from taking action and regulating mercury for the first time.""\ Mercury is a neurotoxin that can have serious neurological, developmental and behavioral effects in both people and wildlife. Coal- and oil-fired power plants are the largest source of unregulated mercury pollution in the United States, accounting for more than 40 percent of the country's mercury emissions.\ The regulations are aimed at large power plants around the country, many of which are upwind of Maine and send pollutants this way.\ Maine is one of 44 states that have issued fish-consumption advisories warning young children and women of childbearing age not to eat most freshwater fish because of the risks of neurological damage.\ Maine loons have some of the highest levels of mercury in their blood in the country.\ EPA issued two proposals in December for reducing mercury pollution, both of which would cut emissions by nearly 70 percent over the next 15 years or more.\ One proposal takes a plant-by-plant approach to reducing emissions. Early goals would be met by using pollution controls that are already in place to control smog and acid rain.\ The second proposal takes a market-based approach and is the proposal the EPA favors. Under this plan, the EPA would set a cap on the total amount of mercury emissions allowed, and plants could buy and sell pollution ""credits"" through a cap-and-trade program.\ Neither proposal satisfies the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Hinck said.\ ""I actually think that if the court grants the relief we seek, those two proposals are gone,"" he said.\ Environmentalists and Maine officials say that EPA's own scientists concluded two years ago that emissions could be cut by more than 90 percent if power plants were forced to install new technology that achieves the strictest emission reductions.\ Hinck said it's important to reduce emissions sooner rather than later because mercury accumulates in the environment and does not degrade or dissipate like other pollutants.\ ""If you reduce the level of (mercury) it doesn't mean that you are getting a reduction in the environment,"" he said. ""You're just adding to the current load.""\ If it is successful, the lawsuit would affect 1,118 boilers at more than 600 of the nation's power plants.\ Assistant Attorney General Jerry Reid said the lawsuit does not change the state's plans for fighting the EPA's position on mercury. The state will be sending off 75 pages of comments this week that say the EPA is misinterpreting the Clean Air Act, he said.\ Reid said the state's comments will object to the cap-and-trade approach because it could result in ""hot spots"" of pollution downwind of power plants that buy a lot of pollution credits.\ The EPA is expected to issue its final mercury rules by Dec. 15.\ Dan Riedinger, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, which represents 190 utilities, said the industry is working on its own cap-and-trade proposal that it will submit to the EPA. He said the industry disagrees with the lawsuit's claim that the EPA is violating the Clean Air Act.\ Staff Writer Meredith Goad can be contacted at 791-6332 or at: mgoad@pressherald.com"
25,"WASHINGTON - A federal appeals court struck down a Bush administration policy allowing some power plants to exceed mercury emission levels, ruling Friday that the government failed to consider the effect on public health and the environment.\The court's rebuke of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was cheered by both Maine officials and environmental organizations that were party to a nationwide effort to scrap the controversial mercury rule.\""The simple truth is the EPA's approach failed to reflect the severity of the situation and would have inevitably failed to protect either the health of our children or Maine's natural resources and the economies that depend on them,"" Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said in a statement.\""The court's ruling that the EPA's mercury rule was improperly crafted and ignored federal law is a welcome judgment,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. ""The agency's flawed rule had excluded major sources of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants until 2018, despite clear evidence that cost-effective mercury control technologies are available.""\The office of Democratic Rep. Tom Allen of Maine's 1st District issued a statement that said in part: ""Maine has some of the most stringent regulations of mercury emissions in the nation. This ruling recognizes that the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to impose regulations on utility company practices in the Midwest and South to curb their emissions that cause mercury pollution nationwide.""\More than a dozen states sued to block the regulation, saying it would allow dangerous levels of mercury into the environment. The toxic metal is known to contaminate seafood and can damage the developing brains of fetuses and young children.\The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit negated a rule known as cap-and-trade. That policy allows power plants that fail to meet emission targets to buy credits from plants that did rather than having to install their own mercury emissions controls. The rule was to go into effect in 2010.\""This three-judge panel has done the world a favor and helped save lives,"" said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, one of many attorneys general who joined a lawsuit originally brought by New Jersey.\The three-judge court unanimously struck down the cap-and-trade policy and the EPA's plan to exempt coal- and oil-fired power plants from regulations requiring strict emissions control technology to block emissions. Before instituting the new regulation, the court held, the government was required to show that emissions from any power plant would not harm the environment or ""exceed a level which is adequate to protect public health with an ample margin of safety.""\The EPA argued it was not required to follow that rule, a stance the court held was ""not persuasive.""\Snowe called allowing power plants to purchase their way out of compliance ""lunacy"" and repeated her calls for a uniform national standard.\The agency defended the rule, saying it represented the nation's first attempt to control such emissions and that it would reduce mercury emissions by 70 percent.\""Keep in mind, the U.S. now has no national mercury emissions regulation for these plants,"" EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said, adding that the EPA would consider whether the cap-and-trade policy could be resurrected under a different regulation. ""It's good for America and it's good for the environment. We want to be a global leader on this issue,"" he said.\Industry organizations strongly supported the plan.\""The court's decision represents a major setback for federal efforts to establish clear mercury regulations for coal-fired power plants,"" said Dan Riedinger, a spokesman for Edison Electric Institute, an association of power companies. ""Now EPA has to go back to the drawing board, pushing mercury regulations far off into the future.""\Mercury is a powerful neurotoxin. The National Academy of Sciences estimates that 60,000 newborns a year could be at risk of learning disabilities because of mercury their mothers absorbed during pregnancy. About 8 percent of U.S. women of childbearing age have enough mercury in their blood to cause concern for a future pregnancy.\Maine was among the states that argued that the cap-and-trade system would endanger children near some power plants that pollute but use credits to do it legally.\In a statement, Maine Attorney General Steven Rowe said the courts ""have rejected a Bush administration attempt to put the profits of corporate polluters above the health of the American people.""\""It is especially disturbing to me that the EPA, the federal agency responsible for protecting the environment, would actively look for ways to avoid its legal obligation to address this most serious environmental threat,"" Rowe said. ""The unanimous decision by the D.C. Circuit Court means that the EPA is going to have to regulate the emission of toxins in a real and meaningful way, just as Congress required in the Clean Air Act.""\Several Maine environmental groups that joined the legal fight against the mercury rule also praised the court action.\""Today's court decision means that dirty old coal plants will have to clean up their act and stop spewing so much mercury pollution,"" Matt Prindiville of the Natural Resources Council of Maine said in a statement. ""This is good news for every family in America and wildlife including loons, fish and eagles. It means that someday our kids will be able to eat the fish they catch from our lakes and rivers.""\The states involved in the lawsuit were California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.\BDN staff writer Kevin Miller contributed to this report."
26,"Greg Kimber knows his U.S. senators care about the environment, but he's upset that they haven't done more to pass a comprehensive energy measure addressing climate change and curbing greenhouse gas emissions.\""It's frustration with the whole Senate,"" Kimber said.\On Wednesday, the Temple native and eight other Mainers protested outside the Augusta offices of Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins.\""At points in their history, they have had an environmental conscience and understanding, so I think they could have been senators that could have pushed for it or done more,"" Kimber said in an interview Friday.\The U.S. House passed a bill last year that included a national cap-and-trade system to regulate carbon emissions, but the Senate has yet to bring forward a parallel measure.\Snowe and Collins are widely viewed as ""get-able"" Republican votes on the issue. While each has offered ideas for a climate measure, they have resisted signing on to the most popular Senate proposal, drafted by John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut.\Snowe said that as long as a year ago, she suggested that a carbon-capping measure should focus on the utility sector, similar to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in which Maine participates.\""Confine it to utilities - Maine is part of the RGGI and it's worked exceptionally well,"" she said in a recent interview. ""Maine coupled it with investments in efficiency and has kept the rates down. So already you've got a model.""\Collins is the only Republican to sign on to a comprehensive energy bill, having crafted a bipartisan measure that includes many of the same goals as the Kerry-Lieberman version.\Beyond the environmental benefits, Collins said, passing a comprehensive measure would help Maine economically.\""It's an opportunity to help transform Maine's economy, to make us a net exporter of energy rather than an importer of energy,"" she said in a recent interview. ""I want the state of Maine to be the world leader in deep-water wind technology, and the best way to bring that about is twofold. One, it's supporting federal investments in the University of Maine and the consortium's research and development; and two, is for clean energy legislation to pass that helps us transition from polluting fossil fuel-based energy to clean energy.""\However, both Snowe and Collins voted recently for a resolution that would have prevented the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating carbon emissions. The Republican-sponsored resolution failed, and the EPA will move forward with regulations in January if Congress does not act.\Tom Tietenberg, a retired economics and environmental studies professor from Colby College, is a leading expert in carbon trading. He said a federal cap-and-trade law is inevitable. It's just a matter of when it gets enacted, and how much environmental damage occurs before Congress acts.\""One of the things that we've learned by studying this is that delay costs money,"" he said. ""I'm disappointed not only from the point of view from the planet, but I'm disappointed from the point of view from economics, because I think we're digging ourselves into a deeper hole that will take us longer and more resources to get out of.""\In cap-and-trade, those who exceed established emission limits can buy ""credits"" from those who don't pollute as much.\Tietenberg, who serves on the board of the Natural Resources Council of Maine and the Efficiency Maine Trust, said cap-and-trade shouldn't be a partisan issue.\""As sort of a political independent, I'm very disappointed that this has become a partisan issue, because it seems to me that saving the planet is something that everybody ought to be concerned about,"" he said. ""The science is relatively clear.""\Tietenberg echoed Kimber's disappointment with the role that Snowe and Collins have played on the issue.\""They have both been active generators of ideas that I think actually have influenced the national process,"" he said. ""Would I like to see more? Yes. ... It's going to be inevitable and highly desirable to do something about climate change, and they are in a position to do more than most people are.""\Tiernan Sittenfeld, legislative director for the Washington, D.C.-based League of Conservation Voters, said the group doesn't regret endorsing Collins over Tom Allen, her Democratic opponent in the 2008 U.S. Senate race.\""She's been a longtime champion on energy and global warming and a number of other environmental issues. Ultimately, I guess she ended up being the only Republican who is officially on a climate bill,"" Sittenfeld said.\Democratic leadership recently announced plans to take up a modified energy bill after the Senate returns from recess in mid-September. The bill would include renewable energy standards, as well as new offshore oil drilling safety regulations. Both Snowe and Collins have said they support such measures.\Kimber said he'd just like to see lawmakers do something.\""We've got an emergency on the horizon globally,"" he said, ""and whatever angles we can take to address it, we should be going for.""\MaineToday Media State House Reporter Rebekah Metzler can be contacted at 620-7016 or at:\rmetzler@centralmaine.com\Credit: By REBEKAH METZLER MaineToday Media State House Writer"
27,"The whole climate-change controversy is at the boiling point on several levels, but they tend to get reported episodically: This law is before Congress, that conference met in Copenhagen, these scientists signed yet another report supporting or contradicting this or that claim about the environment, and so forth.\But there is a unifying theme about what's happening very rapidly now on the three major fronts of the controversy, which are 1) domestic politics; 2) international actions; and 3) the mounting challenges to the U.N. report on humanity's influence on future climate.\Let's take the last one first, because it is the springboard to address the first two.\We're finding out that the fabled ""consensus on climate change"" never was much of a consensus at all. But now it's being shredded by major public disputes led by hundreds, if not thousands, of reputable, credentialed scientists who contradict a famous (but flawed) U.N. report's conclusions about environmental changes.\If you haven't heard much about this, don't blame yourself. While much of the debate is occurring here, U.S. media have been curiously silent about it. But much is happening abroad, too, and foreign media are far less reticent about reporting what has happened in Australia, Japan, Poland, Britain, France, New Zealand and many other places, specifically including the coal-powered industrial giants of India and China.\As Kimberly Strassel pointed out in a Wall Street Journal column on June 26 titled ""The Climate Change Climate Change,"" the common theme behind the hurry disaster-predicting advocates are in to pass their hugely expensive and expansive programs is that the science behind ""global warming,"" as described in the U.N.'s IPCC report, is falling apart.\For example, as Strassel noted, 54 prominent U.S. physicists have demanded their professional society reverse its position that ""the science is settled,"" but both Nature and Science magazines have refused to print their statement.\Dissent is growing in Poland, where the Academy of Sciences says climate change is likely not anthropogenic; in Australia and New Zealand, where the governments are backing away from cap-and-trade policies; and in Norway, where Nobel physics prize-winner Ivar Giaever says warming advocates practice ""a new religion.""\In the United States, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., has 700 credentialed scientists' names on a statement challenging the IPCC's conclusions - ""13 times the number who authored the report's summary for policymakers,"" Strassel notes.\On the international front, the invaluable Benny Peiser issues a daily e-mail digest of stories, comments and links (subscribe by searching ""Peiser CCNet"") that cover international events.\You'll find why Britain is reeling from the projected costs of its CO2 reduction policies; why the president of France wants the nation's top climate skeptic to head up the ministry of industry and innovation; and why India and China, along with many less-developed countries, are demanding hundreds of billions of dollars in direct transfer payments from the United States before they will join in any sort of climate agreement that will abort their economic growth.\In fact, restrictions on imports from China contained in the House-passed ""cap-and-trade"" law have outraged the Chinese government, which threatens a full-fledged trade war in the midst of a recession.\Did you know that global temperatures have been falling, not rising, for the past decade - despite the IPCC's predictions of a steady rise? Have you ever heard the maxim, ""If the facts contradict the theory, find a new theory"" - a maxim now being ignored by our leaders?\Did you know Bjrn Lomborg, the prominent Danish writer on environmental issues, wants advocates to stop spreading scare stories that have caused ""an unbelievable one-third of our children to believe they don't have a future""?\Of course, fear is a big part of the advocates' strategy.\Meanwhile, the ""cap-and-tax"" bill now coming to a Senate near you would impose costs on individual Americans that credible estimates say will be equivalent to a 50 percent hike in an average income tax bill.\True, the president has said the bill will only cost ""the equivalent of a postage stamp a day."" But in 2008 he said, ""Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket"" as power companies passed them on. The price of all fuels and most consumer goods will soar along with power rates.\So, there's a race on. Can the ideologues get a crushing and essentially futile bill in place before the average voter catches on to their scam?\We'll know soon. But this is a fact, not a theory: What's endangered here is your wallet.\M.D. Harmon is an editorial writer.

28,"It is easy to label the just-concluded climate talks in Copenhagen as a failure. But few expected sweeping agreements to come out of the two-week conference. With a modest global outline for moving ahead, the U.S. Senate now turns its attention to a measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that must be passed. This is necessary not just to show the world that America is taking the problem of climate change seriously but also to strengthen our economy, reduce our dependence on foreign energy and lessen our harm to the environment.\Well before delegates from around the globe met in Copenhagen, there was a feeling that the United States - which had refused to ratify the Kyoto accord, the 1997 agreement on emissions reductions - was not doing its part. China was also vilified for balking at ambitious carbon emission reductions while expecting continued international subsidies to develop alternative energy.\If the U.S. Senate passes legislation to significantly reduce emissions, it would go a long way toward dispelling the international hostility. It would also benefit the U.S. and Maine economies. There are currently more than $2 billion worth of alternative energy projects on the drawing board in Maine. Not all of them are likely to come to fruition, but even a portion of this investment could make a big difference to the state economy.\As has been seen elsewhere in the world, if Maine becomes a center of alternative energy generation, it is likely to also become a center of manufacturing for the components needed for that generation. Denmark, for example, produces 20 percent of its electricity from wind and now is a major producer of turbine components. Ditto for Quebec.\""Whether we move ahead with a common-sense plan to create new manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and reduce dependence on foreign oil is not up to other countries; it's up to us,"" Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, said after the Copenhagen meeting. ""A year from now we can be further ahead or further behind, and the Senate will make the difference.\""The sooner the U.S. speaks through Senate legislation, the sooner we can set the terms of engagement for talks to come.""\Senate legislation will focus on a mechanism to cap and trade emissions, similar to what has been done with other pollutants and a system developed by East Coast states to reduce carbon emission while investing in energy efficiency and alternative energy.\Sen. Susan Collins, along with Maria Cantwell, a Democratic senator from Washington, have teamed on a cap-and-dividend bill that would require significant emissions while devoting much of the revenue from the sale of carbon shares to American consumers and businesses, rather than selling the carbon credits in a market system.\""Climate change legislation must protect consumers and industries that could be hit with higher energy prices,"" Sen. Collins said in introducing the bill earlier this month. ""Such legislation also must provide predictability so that businesses can plan, invest and create jobs.""\This approach could be a viable addition to the stalled cap-and-trade legislation. The key is to reduce emissions without unduly burdening consumers and businesses."

LEWISTON - The Androscoggin Valley Soil and Water Conservation District has partnered with the conservation districts in Kennebec and Aroostook counties to continue development of a soil carbon baseline in the state.
\
Establishment of the baseline is necessary for landowners to market soil conservation projects as carbon credits.
\
The conservation districts will be gathering data from representative farms within their counties. Landowners will be contacted this winter to participate in a survey of past and present management and cropping practices.
\
The information, along with other site-specific data, will be entered into a modeling program that will yield the amount of total carbon present in the soils, the baseline. A change in management practices can result in increased carbon and the gain of carbon over time can be counted as a carbon credit and sold on the voluntary cap and trade carbon market.
\
Though this credit is not yet marketed in the state, there are other options that can provide an additional source of income to Maine landowners while also benefiting the environment. Managed forestry projects, tree planting projects, anaerobic manure digester projects, grassland projects and fossil fuel displacement projects are all now acceptable as a source of carbon credits.
\

30,"REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE THE PARTICIPATING STATES are New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont. State leaders are scheduled to meet in Rhode Island Sept. 28 and 29 to sign a final carbon dioxide cap-and-trade agreement. Here are highlights: THE REGION WOULD freeze carbon dioxide emissions from big power plants at about 150 million tons through 2015, then reduce them by 10 percent by 2020. Each state would distribute its share of the 150 million tons to its large power plants, which would have to meet their individual targets by reducing emissions or buying allowances from other plants that can cut pollution more cheaply. STATES COULD RETAIN as much as 20 percent of their carbon dioxide allowances and auction them off to power plants. The proceeds would be used for energy programs. STATES COULD OFFSET as much as half of their mandated pollution cuts with other efforts, such as planting trees to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. MAINE HAS SIX power plants that are large enough to be regulated under the plan: Wyman Station in Yarmouth, Westbrook Energy Center, Androscoggin Energy Center in Jay, Rumford Power, Casco Bay Maine - Independence Energy in Veazie and International Paper in Bucksport.\ Maine and eight other northeastern states are on the brink of setting the nation's first limits on carbon dioxide pollution from power plants.\ After two years of discussion, state officials, energy producers, environmentalists and consumer advocates are debating final details of a proposed cap-and-trade program that is expected to be finalized at the end of this month.\ The plan - called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or ""reggie"" for short - would freeze carbon dioxide pollution at current levels through 2015, then require a 10 percent reduction by 2020. Power generators would have to use cleaner fuels or improve efficiency to stay within the caps, or pay other power plants to make the reductions for them.\ ""We very much support the concept,"" said Dawn Gallagher, commissioner of Maine's Department of Environmental Protection. ""We need to make sure Maine is treated fairly.""\ Gallagher said the pollution limits are projected to cost each household in Maine an additional $9 a year by 2015. But, she said, that is before accounting for efficiency gains, conservation incentives and rebates that the plan would make possible.\ Carbon dioxide, a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion, can cause global warming by trapping heat in Earth's atmosphere.\ When the federal government rejected an international treaty to restrict power plants' carbon dioxide emissions, the northeastern governors decided to create regional rules. The proposal would put the states in step with Canada, Europe and other parts of the world. Newspapers overseas are calling it an environmental rebellion.\ With just about one week until a vote on the plan, there are still intense negotiations that could reshape the scheme. Maine officials are meeting with various parties this morning in Augusta for feedback about the effects here.\ If the agreement is signed as expected, each state will adopt rules next year to begin implementation. Gallagher said she will take the plan to the Legislature for a full public review.\ Maine has six power generating plants that would be subject to the rules. In southern Maine, they include Wyman Station in Yarmouth and Westbrook Energy Center in Westbrook.\ ""We've been cautiously optimistic,"" said John Flumerfelt, a spokesman for Calpine Corp., which owns Westbrook Energy and two other large Maine plants that turn natural gas into electricity.\ Flumerfelt is worried, however, that the company may not get any credit for operating what are already clean and efficient plants, including the three-year-old Westbrook facility. And he said the company objects to a provision that would let the state keep some of the carbon dioxide allowances and sell them to the power plants to raise money for energy-efficiency programs or ratepayer rebates. That would just raise electricity rates, Flumerfelt said.\ ""At a minimum, it's going to cost us a couple million dollars to go out and buy the allowances we will need to operate. We look at that piece of RGGI as a tax,"" he said.\ Maine Public Advocate Steve Ward argues that the auction provision is a critical part of the plan and will actually keep costs down for customers. ""I've been seeing RGGI as an opportunity to greatly increase funding for energy efficiency,"" he said.\ Environmental advocates support auctioning off the allowances. They also are pushing to tighten up parts of the plan that they say would delay or weaken pollution restrictions.\ Matthew Davis of Environment Maine said the proposal would make it too easy for states to avoid cutbacks by claiming credit for other environmental programs, such as planting or maintaining timberlands to take carbon dioxide out of the air. ""It was the program's original stated intent to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants specifically,"" he said.\ Gallagher, the DEP commissioner, disagrees, saying that putting tree growth in the equation would reduce atmospheric carbon in the long run and promote sustainable forestry in Maine.\ Despite the last-minute questions and debates, advocates are hopeful that the plan will become a model for the rest of the country.\ According to Dan Sosland of Environment Northeast: ""This could end up promoting economic development and clean energy in a low- cost way.""\ Staff Writer John Richardson can be contacted at 791 - 6324 or at:\ jrichardson@pressherald.com"
31," Mike Leavitt, administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency, said this week the EPA will rescind a ruling from 2000 that would force power plants to reduce mercury emissions, and instead will debate various methods of reducing this health hazard from the air. Whatever the merits of the alternatives, this new delay - in a line of delays from an administration too often hostile to environmental protection - looks exactly like a decision to put the operation of outdated power plants ahead of the health of the public.\ Mr. Leavitt described his plans as a Dec. 15 deadline approached for his agency to submit rules on how the coal- and oil-fired power plants were to meet standards for use of what is known as ""maximum achievable control technology"" standards. Instead of rules to stop these plants from reducing the 48 tons of mercury they emit annually, the administration now says the need for the rules is just a misunderstanding.\ According to news reports, it argues the Clinton administration misread the Clean Air Act that would require this technology. Instead, a more ""flexible"" plan is to reduce emissions, through a program which would set an overall cap on mercury emissions and allow plants to trade rights (or allowances) for that level of emissions. Called cap-and-trade programs, the idea has been used effectively to reduce pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and to lower the lead content of leaded gasoline.\ But to make such a program more than an excuse to pollute, the EPA must demonstrate that it can be trusted to set tough caps (presumably there would be several, spaced five or six years apart) and ensure the trading program leads to substantial reductions for all plants. Cap-and-trade programs come with a variety of methods, some with the government holding the right to trade allowances, others allowing allowances to be sold among mercury emitters, with or without caps on the price of the allowance. Still others would cap and reduce emissions for individual plants, lowering the cap annually.\ The mechanisms that operate the cap-and-trade system are less important than the intent of the operators. Their intent should be to dramatically lower mercury emissions, which especially affect children and can lead to neurological disorders.\ The administration, understandably, has not earned much trust among environmentalists for its air-quality policies, including others related to power plants. The health risks associated with mercury are not in doubt and the need to reduce emissions has been known for years. All of which makes this latest announcement from the EPA difficult to accept, providing yet another reason for Congress to insist that the agency stop surrendering its mission to protect the environment - and the children who live in it."

An angry national electorate dissatisfied with the Democratic leadership it elected two years ago was poised Tuesday to complete a congressional purge to match forecasts of national pundits.
\
But early returns in Maine showed at least one incumbent Democrat, U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud, positioned to hang on. ""We're feeling good but there are a lot of precincts left to be counted,"" said Greg Olsen, Michaud's campaign manager.
\
According to unofficial results reported by the Bangor Daily News, Michaud led Republican challenger Jason Levesque 59 percent to 41 percent with just under 10 percent of precincts reporting Tuesday night.
\
At 10:30 p.m. CNN was calling Michaud the winner, 57-43 percent.
\
Local unofficial results had Michaud carrying several towns, including Lewiston, Farmington, Bethel, Hanover, Mexico, Oxford, Poland, Gilead and Newry.
\
Levesque won Minot, Lincoln Plantation and Turner.
\
Levesque, an Auburn resident, watched results at a party at the Hilton Garden Inn in Auburn, appeared several times to talk with supporters, which anxiously awaited results.
\
Despite some early favorable results for Levesque, the challenger received a blow when Lewiston went to Michaud, 6,969 to 4,747.
\
Levesque emerged from his hotel room to tell the crowd he'd won Lincoln and Turner. His campaign told the crowd that Republican GOP gubernatorial candidate Paul LePage had won Lewiston, but didn't mention Levesque's loss there.
\
""Well, we won Lincoln and Turner,"" Levesque said. ""It's too early to tell.""
\
The GOP challenger ran a feisty campaign that attacked Michaud's votes on the national health care bill, stimulus spending, and the cap-and-trade bill. Levesque, following the playbook for other Republican congressional candidates, also sought to erode Michaud's Blue Dog image by linking him with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
\
In this election, Pelosi was toxic to incumbent Democrats, just as President George W. Bush was to sitting Republicans in 2008.
\
A Public Policy Poll released in September showed Levesque within seven points of Michaud, but subsequent surveys gave Michaud double-digit leads.
\
Michaud also benefited from a campaign war chest nearly twice the size of his challenger. Latest finance reports show the Democrat with nearly $1 million in campaign donations, much of it from labor and business political action committees.
\
Levesque, by contrast, had about $500,000 less than Michaud. Eighty-two percent of his funding came from individual donors.
\
The funding disparity appeared to hamper Levesque in the closing days of the campaign, forcing him to run Internet ads instead of TV spots.
\
Levesque campaigned almost the entire day in the Lewiston-Auburn region. Michaud campaigned here early before heading to his campaign headquarters in Millinocket.
\
This morning, a woman strode toward the entrance of the Multi-Purpose Center in Lewiston, where Michaud was campaigning.
\
""Hi Mike,"" she shouted.
\
Three heads turned in her direction.
\
One of them was Michaud's, who had propped open one of the entrance doors with his back. He juggled a cup of hot chocolate and a Blackberry, but managed to shakes hands with incoming voters.
\
Dressed down in khakis, black sweater and red down vest, Michaud held open the right door. Across the entrance from him, state Rep. Mike Lajoie, D-Lewiston held back the left door to the city's largest polling place.
\
And standing next to Michaud was the third Mike, state Rep. Mike Carey, D-Lewiston, who wasn't holding a door as he greeted voters.
\
A U.S. Army Reserve retired veteran walked out of the building and turned to Michaud saying, ""You got it. If I could have voted twice, I would have.""
\
A woman followed: ""Good luck, Mr. Michaud,"" she said.
\
Across the river, Levesque was walking into Happy Days Diner in New Auburn behind U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
\
Snowe, who sported a Levesque for Congress sticker on her long black woolen overcoat, stopped at tables, shaking hands like a celebrity.
\
In her wake, Levesque, dressed in dark slacks, a blue dress shirt and red tie, introduced himself as a candidate for the 2nd Congressional District.
\
""I'd be honored to have your vote today,"" Levesque told the diners, explaining he was a husband, father and businessman who grew up in Auburn.
\
He said he hoped to work with Snowe to create the right environment for more jobs.
\
Snowe reminisced with diners about how she started off in the U.S. House of Representatives then moved to the U.S. Senate.
\
""I'd like to follow in her footsteps,"" Levesque said, pointing out that Snowe has held elective office for as long as he's been alive.
\
""I voted for you yesterday,"" said David Thibaudeau of Auburn, who sat eating eggs and a potato pancake.
\
Thibaudeau, 62, a registered Republican, said he was laid off from Poland Spring bottling. Tired of looking for work in a lousy job market, he decided to retire instead.
\
His COBRA health insurance ran out and the estimates he's gotten for private insurance premiums nearly equal his monthly income, he said. He's not eligible for Medicare for three more years.
\
""How can I survive?"" he said.
\
Levesque commiserated, noting his insurance premiums just went up nearly 30 percent.

"
35," AUGUSTA - A delegation from the British Parliament had some advice Tuesday for Maine lawmakers beginning to debate how to meet regional goals to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\ Maine is among 10 states that have signed on to a multistate compact that aims to cap carbon dioxide emissions from power plants beginning in 2009 and then reduce those emissions by another 10 percent over the ensuing decade.\ As Maine and other states prepare to implement the initiative, lawmakers are increasingly looking across the Atlantic for possible guidance.\ On Tuesday, four members of Britain's Parliament traveled to Augusta to share some of their country's successes and stumbles with a European cap-and-trade system on greenhouse gas emissions. They met with Gov. John Baldacci and members of two legislative committees grappling with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\ Their message? It's possible to expand the economy while reducing emissions of the heat-trapping gases that contribute to climate change. But the discussion on how best to achieve those reductions, whether in Europe or New England, is ongoing.\ ""There is still a lot of debate going on,"" said the Right Hon. Greg Knight, the delegation's leader and chairman of the British House of Commons' Procedure Committee. ""But the debate is not about the direction. It's about a means and how to get there.""\ More than two dozen European countries participate in the EU's two-year-old program to reduce greenhouse gases. Under a cap-and- trade program, participating countries set limits on greenhouse gases by allotting a certain number of emissions ""allowances"" or ""credits"" to each power plant based on past emission levels. Plants are then required to reduce those levels over time.\ Power plants that are more efficient than required can either bank their excess allowances for future use or sell them to plants exceeding their limits. This market-based approach is regarded as more flexible than forced regulation because it offers companies a financial incentive to go beyond their emissions goals.\ The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, known as RGGI or ""Reggie"" for short, employs a similar approach to emissions controls.\ The members of Parliament said their country has been aggressively working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for more than a decade.\ From 1990 to 1999, the United Kingdom cut emissions by nearly 14 percent while growing the national economy by 49 percent. Industries related to the environment now employ 400,000 Britons and generate $25 billion to the economy.\ The delegation said such successes were only possible because the British people and politicians have embraced the issue.\ ""We have achieved a political consensus about the issue of climate change,"" said the Hon. Greg Mulholland, who holds the title of junior international development spokesman for Parliament.\ One issue that Maine lawmakers will debate in the coming weeks is whether to force power plants to buy all of their emissions credits upfront and, if so, how to use the money. Officials estimate that selling the credits could generate $30 million.\ RGGI rules require states to auction off at least 25 percent of the credits, but many states have pledged to sell 100 percent. Baldacci officials have announced plans to sell off 100 percent.\ That was one area where the members of Parliament said the Northeastern states could likely learn from European missteps. While the U.K. auctioned 7 percent of its credits, many nations sold less than 1 percent. Yet customers still ended up paying higher rates.\ ""I don't think there is any magic formula,"" said Lord Robin Corbett, a member of the House of Lords since 2001. ""What you have to do is make sure it does serve the purpose of countering emissions and doesn't set up a sort of money-making scheme"" for credit traders.\ The visiting lawmakers praised Maine for its leadership on climate issues, including becoming the first state to set a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Members of the delegation and Baldacci said they also see areas of collaboration between Maine and Britain.\ ""I really think that together we are going to be able to do even more,"" Baldacci said."
36,"Let's hope Maine's U.S. senators enjoy being in the heat of the action on health care reform. It will be a good warm-up for the next item on the congressional to-do list: climate change.\Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins are at the top of the list of Republicans who are most likely to vote for a cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, advocates say it's hard to imagine anything passing without them.\""Maine's senators ... are critical,"" said Rafe Pomerance, president of Clean Air-Cool Planet, a nonprofit group that is lobbying for the law.\The current debate over health care reform has shown what being in that position can mean for Maine and its swing-vote senators.\Snowe helped shape the health care legislation in committee and is the only Republican so far to support the Democratic health care plan.\Now, Collins is getting her share of the heat, and power, as a GOP fence-sitter who could add a measure of bipartisan support.\The stakes could be even higher when it comes to the climate change bill, which will be the focus of committee hearings next week. That's because the Democrats almost certainly cannot pass the bill on their own, at least not with the 60 votes needed to block a filibuster.\Climate legislation will either be bipartisan or dead, says Pomerance, who visited Portland this week for a panel discussion on global warming.\""Energy politics tends to cut regionally rather than along party lines,"" he said. ""Some Democrats from coal states, and some Republicans from coal states, will have problems.""\A cap-and-trade program would have financial winners and losers, and the coal industry would certainly be put at a competitive disadvantage to the natural gas industry, as well as the renewable energy industry.\There are many important details to be worked out before the ""yes"" and ""no"" votes can be counted in the Senate.\How would a cap-and-trade program distribute the emissions allowances? How would the system protect consumers and businesses from higher energy prices? Would the bill promote nuclear energy and offshore oil drilling?\At this point, observers say at least five Republican supporters will be needed to reach 60 votes in the Senate. Those Republicans will be able to make significant changes before adding their support.\Snowe and Collins were the only Republican senators listed as ""probably yes"" votes this week by the online journal Environment & Energy Daily. Several prominent Republicans were labeled ""fence-sitters,"" including John McCain of Arizona (who campaigned for president in favor of cap-and-trade), Lindsay Graham of South Carolina (who called for a compromise in The New York Times this month) and Judd Gregg of New Hampshire (a past supporter of climate change legislation).\It certainly helps that Snowe and Collins represent a state with no coal industry - and aspirations to become the wind and tidal power capital of the Northeast. And it's no coincidence that they also represent a state that helped create the nation's first carbon cap-and-trade system, a 10-state cooperative called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\Those things aside, Snowe and Collins have been studying and talking about climate change for years. They have even co-sponsored unsuccessful bills to reduce climate change emissions and to set up cap-and-trade programs.\When the Senate climate bill was introduced late last month, both Snowe and Collins issued statements saying they were eager to work on the issue. Of course, given the power they are likely to have, they didn't pledge support for anything.\Snowe said Congress must ""end energy paralysis and confront this monumental 21st-century challenge. At the same time, it is imperative any legislation incorporates the well-being of our economy as a foremost priority.""\A spokesman for Collins said she wants to see a bill ""that does not impose onerous burdens on consumers and industry.""\""Both of them are certainly capable of being persuaded to vote for a bill. The large question, however, is what kind of bill,"" said Anthony Buxton, a Portland-based attorney with Preti Flaherty and a member of the firm's Climate Strategy Group.\Buxton helped shape the Northeast cap-and-trade program on behalf of large industry and is closely monitoring the federal debate.\The full Senate debate on climate change may start in earnest this winter, but that depends on when the health care overhaul is finished and whether senators have the stomach for another big battle before the 2010 elections.\Whenever it heats up, Buxton said he's sure that both Maine senators will be right in the middle of it.\""There is no question - they'll have a significant say,"" he said. ""And that's great for Maine and it's good for the country.""\Staff Writer John Richardson can be contacted at 791-6324 or at:\jrichardson@pressherald.com\Credit: by John Richardson staff writer"

\
Let's hope Maine's U.S. senators enjoy being in the heat of the action on health care reform. It will be a good warmup for the next item on the congressional to-do list: climate change.
\
Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins are at the top of the list of Republicans who are most likely to vote for a cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, advocates say it's hard to imagine anything passing without them.
\
""Maine's senators ... are critical,"" said Rafe Pomerance, president of Clean Air-Cool Planet, a nonprofit group that is lobbying for the law.
\
The current debate over health care reform has shown what being in that position can mean for Maine and its swing-vote senators.
\
Snowe helped shape the health care legislation in committee as the sole Republican who was open to supporting it, all the while dodging the national press corps and taking phone calls from President Obama.
\

There are many important details to be worked out before the yes and no votes can be counted in the Senate.

How would a cap-and-trade program distribute the emissions allowances? How would the system protect consumers and businesses from higher energy prices? Would the bill promote nuclear energy and offshore oil drilling?

\
Let's hope Maine's U.S. senators enjoy being in the heat of the action on health care reform. It will be a good warmup for the next item on the congressional to-do list: climate change.
\
Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins are at the top of the list of Republicans who are most likely to vote for a cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, advocates say it's hard to imagine anything passing without them.
\
""Maine's senators ... are critical,"" said Rafe Pomerance, president of Clean Air-Cool Planet, a nonprofit group that is lobbying for the law.
\
The current debate about health care reform has shown what being in that position can mean for Maine and its swing-vote senators.
\
Snowe helped shape the health care legislation in committee as the sole Republican who was open to supporting it, all the while dodging the national press corps and taking phone calls from President Obama.
\
Now Collins is getting her share of the heat, and power, as a GOP fence-sitter who could add a measure of bipartisan support.

39," With the Bush administration determined not to act on climate change, states and cities are doing what they have to - combating the problem on their own. Last week, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced a trans-Atlantic emissions trading program. The next day 22 of the world's largest cities announced plans to bargain for cheaper energy- efficient products and to share ideas on reducing pollution. While these efforts are positive, they would be more productive if they were backed by federal policy.\ The message from Gov. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, was simple: ""We know there is global warming, so we should stop it."" That's why his state teamed up with Britain on a carbon dioxide trading system like the one now in use in Europe to meet emissions reductions in the Kyoto Protocol.\ Eight northeastern states, including Maine, have already teamed up on a trading system. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which includes Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Delaware, aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by 2020. It would do so with a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gases that rewards efficient use of fossil fuels and provides incentives for innovation.\ A cap-and-trade system works by governments setting a cap, or limit, below the current emission level from a specific source; power plants, for example. The emissions amount is divided into credits, which companies can trade, buying or selling based on their levels of efficiency and demand.\ The RGGI model is not the brainchild of a liberal Democrat, but of Republican New York Gov. George Pataki, who encouraged Northeast states to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when it became clear the federal government was not going to set national standards for doing so.\ Other states are considering joining the initiative. California and Britain could, too, further broadening the emissions trading market.\ Because California is the world's seventh largest economy, technological innovations and successful policies there will spread to other states. Maine and many other states, for example, have adopted California's vehicle emissions standards. Such changes, however, would happen nationwide much more quickly if they were supported by the federal government.\ Businesses are already investing in energy efficiency and reducing emissions because it reduces costs. International Paper Co., the country's largest paper company, has cut its carbon dioxide emissions and its costs by increasing its use of wood waste to fuel its operations. DuPont now uses 7 percent less energy that it did in 1990, saving the company $2 billion while producing 30 percent more goods than in 1994 when it began its emissions reductions program. The company has also reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 40 percent since then.\ ""We see that there is not great leadership from the federal government when it comes to protecting the environment,"" Gov. Schwarzenegger said.\ Climate change is a global problem so localized solutions, while helpful, are only part of the answer. Where states, cities and businesses are leading, the U.S. government will eventually have to follow."
40," The state's top environmental regulator and a Maine environmentalist plan to tell a federal hearing in Philadelphia today that proposed federal rules for controlling mercury pollution are dangerous and possibly illegal.\ Officials from the state Attorney General's Office will not attend the Environmental Protection Agency public hearing today and Thursday, but will send written comments asking the EPA not to turn the proposal into policy. All four members of Maine's congressional delegation oppose the proposal.\ Every lake and river in Maine is believed to be contaminated with mercury, much of which blows into Maine in the form of emissions from coal-burning plants in the Midwest.\ Those power plants are the only major mercury polluters not regulated under federal clean air standards, although the Clinton administration classified mercury as a hazardous pollutant, which made it subject to stricter controls.\ The EPA wants to consider mercury a less hazardous pollutant, more similar to smog. It is proposing a ""cap and trade"" program that would set a cap on the amount of mercury that could be emitted but would let power plants buy and sell ""pollution credits."" If they exceeded the cap, they could buy a ""credit"" from a plant that was emitting less than it was permitted to emit.\ The proposal intends to give industry greater flexibility in controlling costs.\ But Maine officials and environmentalists argue that the proposals allow too much mercury, a toxic chemical, into the atmosphere. Dawn Gallagher, commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Protection, will testify against the proposal, her spokeswoman said Tuesday, as will Jon Hinck of the Natural Resources Council of Maine.\ Jerry Reid, an assistant attorney general, is preparing written comments that he will send before the comment period is over March 30.\ ""We think not only is that bad policy, but it violates a section of the Clean Air Act,"" he said.\ U.S. Reps. Thomas Allen and Michael Michaud, Democrats who represent Maine's 1st and 2nd congressional districts, respectively, asked EPA Administrator Michael Leavitt to hold a hearing in New England, but were rebuffed.\ Consequently, Allen will hold his own meeting - from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Monday in the Legislative Council Chambers of the State House in Augusta - to let Maine people offer their thoughts on the proposal. He will forward their comments to the EPA to be entered into the official record.\ Allen said the way to reduce mercury pollution is by restricting the amount of mercury that power plants can emit.\ He said the Clean Air Act demands that mercury be regulated more strictly.\ The administration, he said, is saying, ""If you regulate every plant, there will be companies that will fight the regulations, there will be delays and you won't get . . . a reduction as quickly as if you do a `cap and trade' program.\ ""They're saying we don't have to follow the law because we believe we've got a more effective policy. I disagree,"" said Allen, a member of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee.\ He noted that a new EPA analysis shows that about 630,000 children are born every year with blood mercury levels higher than 5.8 parts per billion, which is the level at which the risk of poor brain development doubles. It also determined that one of every six women of child-bearing age has enough mercury in her bloodstream to threaten the health of a child.\ Reid, of the AG's office, said that if the proposal takes effect, his office would consider suing in federal court.\ In November 2003, U.S. Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, both Republicans, called for stricter mercury regulations.\ In a letter to Leavitt, they wrote that ""mercury emissions from utilities endanger health - from neurodevelopmental damage in fetuses, to heart, kidney and liver effects in adults - and threaten our wildlife and natural environment.""\ Snowe is a lead co-sponsor of a bill that would mandate substantial reductions in mercury emissions from all major sources in the United States.\ Staff Writer Joshua L.

41,"AUGUSTA - Energy experts long have touted home weatherization as the best way to save money while reducing Maine's reliance on fossil fuels.\Now, state officials have developed a plan to potentially make money from Maine's aggressive weatherization efforts, using the growing international ""carbon market"" to help fund additional energy efficiency projects.\MaineHousing officials said this week that they have taken a step toward being able to sell ""carbon credits"" from greenhouse gas emissions reductions achieved through weatherization projects.\If completed, Maine's plan to sell credits from weatherization projects on the carbon market could set an international precedent. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits then would be reinvested in the state's energy efficiency and weatherization programs.\""We're the first in the world. We're not just the first state,"" said Dale McCormick, director of MaineHousing, the state's affordable housing agency.\Carbon dioxide has emerged as a type of commodity in recent years as governments and the private sector seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases linked to global warming.\Typically, one carbon credit equals 1 ton of carbon dioxide, and those credits are bought and sold as part of an emissions market intended to provide companies with a financial incentive to reduce emissions. Maine, for instance, is part of the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that placed a cap-and-trade system on fossil fuel-burning power plants.\Before selling carbon credits, Maine's system for quantifying the amount of carbon dioxide reduced as a result of weatherization projects must be validated by two, independent accreditors.\In particular, validators are looking to make sure that Maine's CO2 reductions are real, verifiable, permanent and eligible for sale on the carbon market, which is where companies and traders buy and sell credits.\First Environment, one of the third-party accreditors, already has signed off on Maine's methodology. The state is in the process of seeking a second validation.\McCormick estimated that between MaineHousing and Efficiency Maine Trust programs, the state could sell 8,000 carbon credits a year. Exactly how much revenue that would produce is impossible to say, however, because the price of carbon credits fluctuates so much.\Peter Shattuck, a carbon markets policy analyst at the Maine-based nonprofit organization Environment Northeast, said he was interested in learning more about Maine's plan.\One key for the state, Shattuck said, will be to meet the stringent requirements for showing that the emissions reductions are, among other criteria, verifiable and stemmed from new projects that would not have been undertaken otherwise.\As an analogy, Shattuck said a power plant cannot earn carbon credits for shutting down an inefficient, coal-fired power plant that already was slated to be taken off line.\""In general, I think it's an intriguing financing mechanism for weatherization projects,"" Shattuck said.\McCormick said the idea behind attempting to sell carbon credits for weatherization projects began simply enough.\""We're saving energy when we weatherize homes, so we must be saving carbon as well, so why don't we sell it?"" McCormick said. ""We always need more money for weatherization.""\When those discussions began about two years ago, she and others assumed that someone already had developed a model that Maine could follow.\""But, in fact, nobody had because they have been concentrating on the low-hanging fruit, which in the carbon world is big power plants ... or methane recovery from [cattle] feed lots,"" McCormick said.\Compared to those industrial projects, carbon emission reductions from weatherization projects in Maine are relatively tiny. But when combined with credits from similar weatherization efforts in other states, they could become a sizable figure.\It was unclear Thursday on which carbon markets Maine would seek to sell the weatherization credits.\Upon their return to Washington, D.C., Congress is expected to resume debate about a potential federal climate bill that could feature a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. Some supporters of federal climate legislation have suggested that the 2-year-old Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative could serve as a model.\Under RGGI, the 10 participating states agreed to cap emissions levels from fossil fuel-burning power plants and then reduce those levels by 10 percent by 2018. Sales of the allowances or credits have generated more than $660 million for the 10 states, including more than $20 million for Maine.\Credit: KEVIN MILLER OF THE NEWS STAFF"
42," The American Enterprise Institute's offer of $10,000 to scientists, economists and public policy experts willing to critique the latest report from an international climate science panel has generated a storm of complaints.\ By contrast, British billionaire Richard Branson's offer of $25 million to anyone who can remove a billion tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere has received naught but polite applause.\ Make no mistake: The success of the intense effort to prop up contrarians willing to create an atmosphere of overheated uncertainty and political stasis in the country is a national disgrace.\ But that's an indictment of our politicians, not the American Enterprise Institute.\ The scientific method invites attacks on hypotheses both new and settled. That's how society develops confidence in the interpretation of scientific research.\ The notion that one species could alter the entire atmosphere in a way that changes weather patterns across the globe for centuries is nothing if not astounding and demands the highest standard of proof.\ It is a bit much, however, for AEI, a group that has such a well- documented record of supporting attacks on the research that underpins current theories of climate change, to now wrap itself in the flag of academic freedom.\ How about a little cheese with your whine, fellas?\ To be fair, the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does tamp down some of the most dire predictions of temperature and sea-level rise. That's to be expected: Computer simulations become more accurate as more relevant information is incorporated. Equally important is that after 18 years of reviewing and critiquing climate research, the IPCC is 90 percent certain that fossil fuel pollution is changing the world.\ Some scientists are warning that the IPCC's latest assessment is too conservative. Their arguments will be tested in coming years on the battlefield of peer review.\ Still, the AEI and Branson offers provide an interesting window into the ongoing shift in climate politics.\ AEI rakes in millions in contributions each year, yet it's only willing to put up a piddling $10,000 for those willing to dig through the IPCC report and attempt to provide a credible alternative hypothesis.\ Twenty-five million may be pocket change to Branson, an airline tycoon whose industry has been under attack in Europe as a major carbon-dioxide emitter. But it's a prize worthy of the kind of paradigm shattering innovation that could help stave off the worst- case scenario.\ If history tells us anything, however, it's that prevention is almost always cheaper than the cure. That's why, despite the Bush administration's opposition to government policies to reduce greenhouse gasses, one University of New Hampshire researcher says it won't be long before we see significant federal policies to do just that. These include a national greenhouse gas cap, a carbon cap-and-trade system, increased vehicle efficiency standards and mandatory renewable energy mandates.\ ""Certain climate policy options have gained momentum as they've been instituted in some states and advocated by an ever-broader coalition of actors,"" said Stacy D. VanDeveer, an associate professor of political science. As evidence about these policy experiments here and in other countries rolls in, it's becoming tougher and tougher for opponents to claim the sky is falling.\ ""Think about what the president used to say about how Kyoto would wreck the economy,"" VanDeveer said. ""That's increasingly a silly claim. He's right that there will be costs to some, inconvenience to some, and that some will pay while others don't.""\ But without doing anything terribly radical, Europe has been able to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions without sacrificing its productivity.\ ""Europe has competitiveness issues in general, but there's very little evidence and in fact very few European analysts who claim environmental standards are the cause,"" he said.\ And as the consensus that global warming poses significant risks to the environment and the economy strengthens, the argument will inevitably become more focused on how to most cost-effectively address the problem instead of whether there's a problem at all.\ Perhaps the best evidence of this was the white flag hoisted last week by one of AEI's long-time supporters, the petro-giant Exxon- Mobil Corp.\ While the world's biggest petroleum company isn't rushing to find alternatives to natural gas and oil, company officials now allow that it's prudent for governments to find ways to combat climate change.\ Feel the fresh wind blowing?\ Theo Stein is an editorial writer for the Portland Press Herald/ Maine Sunday Telegram and can be contacted at 791-6481 or:\ tstein@pressherald.com"
43,"In a major, but predictable, turnaround, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last week ruled that greenhouse gas emissions are harmful to public health, and, therefore, should be regulated. The decision puts the United States back on track to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and four other gases, after such action was derailed by the Bush administration.\The EPA action did not include any specifics on how the greenhouse gases would be regulated, nor did it include targets for emissions reductions. That work would best be done by Congress, through an open, public process, rather than the EPA.\Many in Congress are ready to do this work, including Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, who have long worked for higher fuel economy standards, tighter power plant pollution rules and other legislation to reduce climate change.\""Today's endangerment finding proposed ruling must compel Congress to move past the gridlock and sound bites of the past and work together to expeditiously act to address climate change through a cap-and-trade system,"" Sen. Snowe said last week.\""A new regulatory structure is the only way that we can assure that carbon emissions will be reduced in a manner that will be consistent with economic recovery and future economic growth, while protecting the environment and the public's health and quality of life,"" she added.\Fear of tipping the balance too far toward the environment and away from economic growth has led to nearly a decade of inaction on climate change in the U.S. After pledging to regulate carbon emissions as a candidate, George Bush quickly reversed himself after taking office.\In the meantime, large corporations, seeking certainty, began asking for climate change regulations. In 2007, companies including General Electric, Duke Energy, BP and Caterpillar called on Congress to develop a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions that would lead to reductions of 10 percent to 30 percent over the next 15 years.\A few months later, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA had the authority to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from cars. The agency, under the Bush administration, had argued that carbon dioxide was not a pollutant so the federal government could not regulate it.\Further, the court ordered the EPA to assess the impact of the gases on human health and the environment. If the agency found that were not a threat, it had to say why not, the court ruled. Although EPA scientists said the gases posed a threat, the Bush administration continued to stall.\Last week's EPA announcement, which was based on scientific review that found increased risk of drought, wildfires, sea level rise and flooding from rising greenhouse gas levels, was the result of a reassessment under the Obama administration.\Now comes the difficult work of crafting rules to reduce emissions that build on the work already done by some facilities, such as Maine's natural gas-fired paper mills. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, of which Maine is a member, can be a helpful guide.\Greenhouse gas regulations have long been expected. So, now is the time for Congress, regulators and industry to find the best way to reduce emissions while also spurring economic growth."
44,"Note: ""If we aren't supporting those kind of initiatives, people are going to turn away from what we're offering."" Warren Cook Saddleback Ski Area CEO\More than 100 Maine businesses, ranging from paper mills to a ski resort, are joining forces to call for federal action against climate change, according to a leading environmental group.\Representatives of some of those businesses and the Natural Resources Council of Maine plan to release a joint letter to the state's congressional delegation during a State House news conference today. It will call for swift and strong action to fight global warming because of the threats it poses to the state's economy and environment, as well as the potential benefits of investing in renewable energy, according to the group.\The effort is the latest sign, experts said, that businesses in Maine and around the country are embracing the value of reducing energy use and waste, and are ready to support new federal climate-change regulations.\""In an area like we live in, you've got to be looking at the whole climate and energy issue,"" said Warren Cook, chief executive officer of Saddleback Ski Area near Rangeley and one of the signers of the letter.\Other businesses involved in the effort include Verso Paper, owner of two Maine paper mills, the Harraseeket Inn in Freeport and Reed & Reed General Contractors of Woolwich, a builder of new wind farms in northern and western Maine.\Cook said Maine businesses know the importance of the state's natural resources and that they have a role to play in protecting them.\He also said consumers now expect all kinds of businesses to reduce their impact on the environment.\""If we aren't supporting those kind of initiatives, people are going to turn away from what we're offering, whether it's real estate or a vacation experience,"" he said.\Businesses around the country are expressing similar support, said Thomas Tietenberg, a retired Colby College economics professor. That's especially true now that the Obama administration and Congress are pledging to create new regulations, possibly including a nationwide cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions.\""What you have is a whole lot of businesses that have signed on now to doing something at the federal level,"" he said. ""They want more certainty. Now they know that something is going to happen, but they have no idea what.""\Bill Cohen, spokesman for Verso Paper, said the paper maker supported the regional cap-and-trade system that started last year in Maine and other northeastern states, and now wants to help shape the nationwide version.\""The Obama administration has sent a very strong signal that it's going to cap-and-trade at the national level, and we believe we've been through the pain of developing a working model here,"" he said.\The company employs about 1,800 people at its Rumford and Jay paper mills, and relies on the state's spruce and fir forests to make the lightweight coated paper used in magazines and catalogs, Cohen said.\More business leaders are buying into conservation to maximize profits as well as to cultivate green reputations, said Nory Jones, director of graduate business programs at the University of Maine's Maine Business School.

45," Sign the petitions to cut climate-changing pollutants, attend the rallies, get exercised about the fate of the Earth. Today is Step It Up day, with a couple dozen rallies around Maine and hundreds nationally to demand action in Congress. But while you Step It Up, you might also Try It Out to get a feel for what you're demanding.\ The Step It Up campaign is simple: By 2050, the United States will cut its carbon-based energy use by 80 percent. It's also immensely complicated: What heats your house? Where are your clothes from? You are an unintentional global trader in a market that runs on fossil fuels.\ How are you going to get to work or to school? How will you get to the grocery store to pick up the plastic-encased quart of strawberries from California? You may say, virtuously, that you will get them in your Prius, in which your neighbor will car pool on her way to the carbon-offset store, but you know, if you are anything like 99 percent of us, that your days are filled with endless comforts that have helped raise average global temperatures.\ I remember a Cold War truism: The only thing that would bring all of us together, friendly and hostile nations alike, was a threat from outer space. Now it's here, only it's inner space and, instead of alien invasion, it is humankind's sustained gassy belch from a century of pleasurable feasting at the planet's table.\ Congress should act; the president should act. They should establish standards, incentives, investments and tough rules to move this nation away from the fossil-fuel economy that has taken us this far. This week's Time magazine has a handy section on what works to reduce climate-change emissions, and, as you might guess, the action leans heavily on governmental decisions: carbon cap-and-trade, sequestration, a carbon tax, green building design standards.\ Before members of Congress risk acting on these, however, they will test - do you really want these things? Even if the economy must change, sometimes painfully? Even if there are new taxes involved? They will want to know how committed you are to a new course, and more than your petitions to them, they will want to see you act first. That is the nature of political leadership.\ Fortunately, there's plenty you can do that, while having a small environmental impact, matters for the unambiguous message it sends. Start, for example, with knowing your footprint - the amount of land you require to serve the way you currently live. There's a simple way to estimate it at myfootprint.org. Answer the 15 or so questions (there's an in-depth questionnaire under the site's FAQs). If you're not a good 25 percent below the national average, you're a serious part of the problem.\ The Union of Concerned Scientists' book ""A Consumer's Guide to Effective Environmental Choices"" says forget worrying about whether you use Styrofoam cups, your kids are in cloth or disposable diapers and your clothes are cotton or polyester. Those aren't what counts when piling up pollution.\ Instead, it hits the biggies - buy a house close to work; think twice about that second car - that set fine long-term strategies but don't do much for immediate payback.\ Try something simpler: Plan your errands for the next week and combine as many trips as you can on an efficient route. (Delivery companies, where profits depend on this, have extensive computer programs to help them; you might use your brain and a map as effectively.) The more you can cut your mileage, the more your vehicle becomes the equivalent of an enviro-car.\ Eat less red meat. Meat consumption doesn't sound like a climate- change problem, but to produce the same nutritional value from meat as from grains takes about 3.4 times the greenhouse gases; for poultry, it's about 1.4 times. Buy food locally and reduce the need for shipping. The Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (mofga.org) can help you find sources.\ Keep buying those compact fluorescent light bulbs. With the rebates being offered, even if you hate the environment they're a great deal. And no person can use a clothes dryer year-round and be an environmentalist. Get a clothesline. With global warming here, it will work faster than ever.\ You won't solve the climate-change problem with these or any of a dozen more steps, but by acting now you will demonstrate your seriousness about the issue. The point is to make an environmental commitment, even if that means accepting a little inconvenience. Then contact the politicians - and just think of all the persuasive anecdotes you'll have to make your point.\ Todd Benoit is the editorial page editor of the Bangor Daily News.

46," AUGUSTA - By an overwhelming vote Friday, the House of Representatives approved legislation to include Maine in a regional effort to control greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade system.\ The bill, LD 1851, a reworked version of legislation submitted by Gov. John Baldacci, was endorsed by a 120-7 roll call vote in the House a day after a similarly lopsided vote in favor. It faces further House and Senate votes.\ It would include Maine in the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the nation's first cap-and-trade program of its kind. The regional effort is intended to reduce pollution from the region's power plants by 10 percent over a decade through 2018.\ By authorizing the initiative, the Legislature would endorse Baldacci's commitment to enter into RGGI. The legislation would require Maine's six largest power plants to pay for the right to release carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas most blamed for global warming.\ The legislation also directs major new investments in energy efficiency which will help lower electricity costs for Maine consumers and reduce the need to run local power plants.\ Under the bill, Maine's pro rata share of the total allowed emissions for 2009 is 5.9 million tons of carbon dioxide per year. Maine's limit would drop to slightly more than 5.3 million tons in 2018.\ Michael Stoddard, deputy director of Environment Northeast, a nonprofit advocacy group that supports RGGI, said Maine's legislation ""is a model for other U.S. states and Canadian provinces to follow.""\ Stoddard's group said the bill moved forward when key businesses, environmental groups, Baldacci and legislative leaders worked together to iron out complex details, such as how to allocate money from the sale of pollution permits, which many of the other RGGI states have yet to work out.\ The Maine bill moved forward as President Bush urged international cooperation in cutting the gases that trap heat on the Earth.\ Bush's proposal Thursday that the United States and other nations responsible for most heat-trapping emissions sit down and develop a long-term strategy drew praise from U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R- Maine.\ ""While he has not hit a walk-off home run, I truly welcome him onto the field,"" Snowe said in a statement. ""There is a great urgency here and the United States must be a leader in building a universal solution."""
47,"EMISSIONS PLAN AT ISSUE MERCURY IS a heavy metal, like lead, that can damage the brain and nervous system. It is particularly dangerous to fetuses and young children. AN EPA RULE released this month would reduce emissions of mercury from the nation's 600 coal- burning power plants from 48 tons a year now to 38 tons by 2010. By 2018, the limit would drop to 15 tons a year. THE RULE ALLOWS a ""cap- and-trade"" approach, which limits how much pollution should be allowed, then lets companies trade within those limits. Some companies can increase pollution and buy credits from others that invest in cleaner technology. THE APPROACH is favored by the EPA and utilities as a way of using market incentives. But it is criticized by environmentalists and state officials because Maine is downwind of coal-fired plants that can avoid cutbacks. HAVE YOUR SAY THE PUBLIC IS INVITED to a discussion about mercury pollution Tuesday with members of Congress, environmental leaders and a scientist. TUESDAY'S FORUM is a chance for the public to talk to experts about the levels of contamination and the effects on wildlife and people. Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, Brownie Carson, executive director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, Kevin Carley of Maine Audubon and Dave Evers of the BioDiversity Research Institute are scheduled to attend. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, also may take part. THE FORUM WILL BEGIN at 7 p.m. on the 7th floor of the Glickman Family Library at the University of Southern Maine.\ Maine's attorney general plans to sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over new federal mercury pollution rules, an attorney for the state said Monday.\ Maine will join at least eight other states in a lawsuit calling for more aggressive restrictions on coal-fired power plants - considered the nation's largest source of mercury pollution and the primary reason Maine's lakes and freshwater fish are contaminated. The lawsuit will be filed in the next week or two, said Assistant Attorney General Jerry Reid.\ Although a lawsuit pitting the state against the Bush administration is unfortunate, he said, ""it's also necessary under these circumstances.""\ Reid joined U.S. Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, and Brownie Carson, executive director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, at a news conference at Portland City Hall to criticize the EPA's rule as illegal and harmful to Maine. By not regulating mercury aggressively as a hazardous pollutant and not requiring plants to install new, cleaner technology, the rules violate the Clean Air Act, they said.\ ""These reduction levels are embarrassing, and no one can say we don't have the technology,"" Allen said. ""EPA has stained its own credibility.""\ An EPA spokeswoman defended the rule in an e-mail, saying the United States has become the first nation to regulate emissions from coal-fired power plants. Cynthia Bergman said protecting the public from mercury poisoning is the agency's top priority, but it requires global restrictions.\ ""We could eliminate all mercury emissions from U.S. coal-fired power plants but it still wouldn't solve the problem, because most of the fish we eat - close to 80 percent - are from overseas, from countries and waters beyond our reach and control,"" she wrote. The EPA advises pregnant women and children to limit meals of certain seafoods.\ The EPA plan would reduce emissions of mercury from the nation's 600 coal-burning power plants from 48 tons a year now to 38 tons by 2010. By 2018, the limit would drop to 15 tons a year.\ Power plants would not be required to install mercury controls until 2018, Reid said, because the initial reductions would be made as plants comply with existing requirements to reduce soot and smog pollution. Individual plants could buy credits from cleaner plants rather than make reductions, according to the rule.\ ""The rule is carefully crafted to allow the industry to avoid installing new technology"" to cut mercury pollution, Reid said.\ Maine will be especially hurt by the rules, critics say, because the state is downwind of aging power plants to the south and west. Maine already advises that pregnant women and children not eat freshwater fish from the state's waterways, and is considered to have some of the most severely contaminated wildlife in the country.\ Carson called for a congressional inquiry into the rule, saying U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, should convene hearings of the Senate's Government Affairs Committee.\ ""The shameful pandering to polluters at the expense of protecting the health of Mainers and our environment is a perversion of the rule-making process and the agency's legal responsibility,"" he said.\ Collins has been a vocal critic of the rule and, while not calling for hearings, sent a letter last week asking to meet with the EPA's acting administrator about the way the agency created the rule.\ U.S. Rep. Michael Michaud, D-Maine, released a statement Monday criticizing the rule as ""a case of special-interest politics trumping public health, plain and simple.""\ And U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, announced Monday that she will reintroduce legislation to reduce mercury emissions from power plants, solid waste incinerators and other sources by 95 percent in five years.\ Maine is one of several states that filed two other lawsuits against the EPA in 2003 under the Clean Air Act.\ One lawsuit seeks to block Bush administration efforts to loosen air pollution rules on utilities, refineries and other industrial facilities. The other would require the administration to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant.\ Staff Writer John Richardson can be contacted at 791 - 6324 or at:\ jrichardson@pressherald.com"

The nation's first mandatory carbon-trading scheme is being credited with potentially creating nearly 1,000 jobs while promoting energy-efficiency projects in industries located across Maine.
\
Sixteen projects were awarded $8.9 million in state and federal grant money on Wednesday. Gov. John Baldacci announced the grants in a press conference.
\
""These projects are ready to go,"" Baldacci said.
\
These funds are a combination of federal stimulus money, plus revenues from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, which requires industry to pay for each ton of carbon dioxide they release into the atmosphere.

\
About $6 million of the grant money came from the $36 million promised to Maine under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act.
\
The remaining $2.9 million, however, was earmarked from earnings from the RGGI carbon-credit auction.
\
A principle of RGGI was returning revenue, in the form of efficiency grants, to the industries that bought credits to offset their carbon emissions.
\
Environmental advocates said Wednesday's grant awards proves RGGI, and cap-and-trade programs as a whole, can work.
\
""I think this is a vindication of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the consensus that environmental groups were able to reach with industry to use cap-and-trade to support energy efficiency because it is good for our economy and our environment,"" said Dylan Voorhees, energy project director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine.
\
Under RGGI, credits can be thought of as a license to emit carbon dioxide.
\
There have long been voluntary cap-and-trade systems in the United States -- and far more robust mandatory trading systems in Europe -- but RGGI is the first program in the nation that requires all industrial carbon-dioxide emitters in the states that opt in to pay for what they emit.
\
Ten states have signed on, from Maine to Maryland. The most recent cost of an allowance to emit a ton of carbon dioxide in Maine was $2.05.

50,"In his July 7 letter to the editor, John Frary predicts ruinous costs to Maine's 2nd District from carbon cap-and-trade legislation passed by the House and being considered in the Senate. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated such a program would cost $175 per household annually, a figure that does not include benefits, such as energy efficiency, not having to breathe in so much pollution, and a slowing of the effects of climate change.\One wonders what Mr. Frary would propose if he doesn't like cap and trade - a carbon tax? Continuing as we are now? In fact, as Yale Environment 360 points out, ""the days of freely dumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere are coming to an end."" Those concerned about U.S. energy independence and climate change agree that emitting carbon is no longer going to be free.\If the U.S. doesn't start soon on developing clean energy technologies, it will be left in the dust economically by countries that do - such as China, already an innovator in renewable energy. For that reason, the cap-and-trade option has attracted many supporters - including big businesses such as General Electric, Dow Chemical, Shell Oil and Duke Energy.\I commend Maine's representatives, Mike Michaud and Chellie Pingree, for voting for the cap-and-trade bill in the House, and urge Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins to support a strong bill curbing greenhouse gases. Our future depends on it.\Christina Diebold\Bangor"

AUGUSTA -- Greg Kimber knows his senators care about the environment, but he's upset they haven't done more to pass a comprehensive energy measure addressing climate change and curbing greenhouse gas emissions.
\
""It's frustration with the whole Senate,"" Kimber said. On Wednesday, the Temple native and eight more Mainers staged protests outside U.S. Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins' Augusta offices.
\
""At points in their history, they have had an environmental conscience and understanding, so I think they could have been senators that could have pushed for it or done more,"" Kimber said in an interview on Friday.
\
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure last year that included a national cap-and-trade system that would regulate carbon emissions, but the U.S. Senate has yet to bring forward a parallel measure. Snowe and Collins are widely viewed as ""get-able"" Republican votes on the issue. While each has offered ideas for a climate measure, they have resisted signing on to the most popular proposal on the Hill, drafted by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.
\
Snowe said that as long a year ago, she suggested that a carbon-capping measure should focus on the utility sector, similar to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that Maine participates in.
\
""Confine it to utilities -- Maine is part of the RGGI and it's worked exceptionally well,"" she said in a recent interview. ""Maine coupled it with investments in efficiency and has kept the rates down. So already you've got a model.""
\
Collins is actually the only Republican to sign on to a comprehensive energy bill, having crafted a bipartisan measure that holds many of the same goals as the Kerry-Lieberman version; but rebating revenue generated by auctioning off carbon caps to taxpayers.
\
Beyond the environmental benefits, Collins said passing a comprehensive measure would help Maine economically.
\
""It's an opportunity to help transform Maine's economy, to make us a net exporter of energy, rather than an importer of energy,"" she said in a recent interview. ""I want the state of Maine to be the world leader in deep water wind technology and the best way to bring that about is twofold. One, it's supporting federal investments in the University of Maine and the consortium's research and development; and two, is for clean energy legislation to pass that helps us transition from polluting fossil fuel-based energy to clean energy.""
\
However, both Snowe and Collins recently voted for a controversial resolution that would have prevented the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating carbon emissions. The Republican-sponsored resolution failed, and the EPA will move forward with regulations in January if Congress does not act.
\
Tom Tietenberg, a retired economics and environmental studies professor from Colby College, is a leading expert in carbon trading. He said a federal cap-and-trade law is inevitable. It's just a matter of when it gets passed -- and how much environmental damage occurs before Congress acts.
\
""One of the things that we've learned by studying this is that delay costs money,"" he said. ""It's a complete shame. I'm disappointed not only from the point of view from the planet, but I'm disappointed from the point of view from economics, because I think we're digging ourselves into a deeper hole that will take us longer and more resources to get out of.""
\
Tietenberg, who serves on the board of the Natural Resources Council of Maine and the Efficiency Maine Trust, said cap-and-trade shouldn't be a partisan issue.
\
""As sort of a political independent, I'm very disappointed that this has become a partisan issue because it seems to me that saving the planet is something that everybody ought to be concerned about,"" he said. ""This is a big issue. The science is relatively clear.""
\
Tietenberg echoed Kimber's disappointment with the role Snowe and Collins have played so far on the topic, however.
\
""In a sense, they have been active supporters of the process of doing something about it; they have both been active generators of ideas that I think actually have influenced the national process,"" he said. ""Would I like to see more? Yes. Because, like I said before, I think it's going to be inevitable and highly desirable to do something about climate change; and they are in a position to do more than most people are, because of their unique political position.""
\
Tiernan Sittenfeld, legislative director for the Washington, D.C.-based League of Conservation Voters, said the group doesn't regret endorsing Collins over Tom Allen, her Democratic opponent in the 2008 U.S. Senate race.
\
""She's been a longtime champion on energy and global warming and a number of other environmental issues. Ultimately, I guess she ended up being the only Republican who is officially on a climate bill,"" she said, adding that the pro-environment lobbying group was also disappointed with both senators' vote for the failed resolution banning the EPA from regulating carbon.
\
Democratic leadership recently announced plans to take up a modified energy bill after the Senate returns in mid-September. The bill would include energy renewable standards, as well as new offshore oil drilling safety regulations. Both Snowe and Collins have said they support such measures.
\
Kimber said he'd just like to see lawmakers do something.
\
""I understand that they've got their irons in the fire or the things they are working on, but the fact that nothing happened is basically where I'm at,"" he said. ""It seems to me, we've got an emergency on the horizon globally, and whatever angles we can take to address it, we should be going for.""

""She's been a long-time champion on energy and global warming and a number of other environmental issues. Ultimately, I guess she ended up being the only Republican who is officially on a climate bill,"" she said, adding that the pro-environment lobbying group was also disappointed with both senators' vote for the failed resolution banning the EPA from regulating carbon.
\
Democratic leadership recently announced plans to take up a modified energy bill after the Senate returns in mid-September. The bill would include energy renewable standards, as well as new offshore oil drilling safety regulations. Both Snowe and Collins have said they support such measures.
\
Kimber said he'd just like to see lawmakers do something.
\
""I understand that they've got their irons in the fire or the things they are working on, but the fact that nothing happened is basically where I'm at,"" he said. ""It seems to me, we've got an emergency on the horizon globally and whatever angles we can take to address it, we should be going for.""

54,"While international attention is focused on Bali, where the successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol is being discussed, action in the Senate could be more important in determining the United States' course in addressing climate change. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is finalizing a bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Susan Collins, that would, for the first time, cap greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.\The bill, the American Climate Security Act, faces many hurdles. Republicans on the committee, notably Ohio's Sen. George Voinovich, say they will oppose the legislation because it may harm business. Environmental groups warn that the measure allows power companies to avoid emissions cuts, while reaping huge profits, by giving away too many emissions allowances.\Still, the bill remains an important vehicle for a critical debate about what steps the U.S. is willing to take to address climate change and, further, what the country's role will be in any international agreement.\Now that the U. S. is the only industrialized country to not sign onto the Kyoto Protocol - Australia did so just days after Prime Minister Kevin Rudd took over from Conservative John Howard - much of the talk in Bali will focus on the U.S. role. The U.S., in turn, will point to quickly developing countries, such as China and India, for not doing enough to limit their own emissions.\Just as the U.S. is right to suggest India and China need to rein in their emissions, these countries are right to expect leadership from the U.S. The Climate Security Act gives the U.S. a chance to show that leadership.\The bill calls for a 15 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and a 70 percent reduction by 2050. Companies would trade emissions allowances, which would enable efficient companies to sell their allowances to those that couldn't meet the targets. Such cap and trade systems have worked for other pollutants.\As with the debate over emissions allowances under the Northeast's greenhouse gas reduction program, known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative or RGGI, much of the discussion will focus on whether allowances are given away or sold. Giving away too many allowances to utility companies could allow them to continue to operate highly-polluting units while charging for all the allowances would not take into account recent upgrades.\The bill is not perfect, but it represents a huge step forward in the climate debate."
55,"""It is very disappointing to see the efforts by the current administration, which in some respects have the effect of rolling back provisions of the act."" Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, oversaw 1990 reauthorization of the Clean Air Act\ Leon Billings had a front-row seat for the creation of the 1970 Clean Air Act, the sweeping national legislation that over the past three decades has dramatically improved air quality in the United States.\ As staff director of the U.S. Senate's clean air subcommittee, Billings helped write the legislation. He participated in the back- room debates, and watched as industry officials tried to intimidate his boss, Democratic Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, into backing down from measures that would clean the air but cost them money.\ Now, more than 30 years later, Billings is alarmed by the changes in clean air policy that the Bush administration wants to make. The Bush administration has relaxed regulations requiring plants to invest in pollution controls, saying it will make it easier for companies to upgrade their plants, which will make the air cleaner. But environmentalists and public health officials say the changes will gut the Clean Air Act.\ ""I'm very, very, very fearful,"" said Billings, who is now president of the Washington, D.C.-based Clean Air Trust, an organization created by Muskie and Vermont's Republican Sen. Robert Stafford to defend the Clean Air Act from attacks by special interests.\ ""The only thing right now that is saving clean air,"" he said, ""is the fact that there are some people like (Maine Sens.) Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and a couple of other Republicans, who know that they can't go home having voted for dirty air.""\ Billings and others who worked hard to create or significantly improve the Clean Air Act over the years say current efforts by the Bush administration to relax it are ""discouraging"" and ""very disappointing,"" and that Muskie would be ""outraged"" by what is happening to the legislation that he championed.\ Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, who shepherded major improvements to the act through Congress when it was reauthorized in 1990, said working on the clean air bill was ""probably the most difficult legislative task that I encountered in all my years in the Senate.""\ ""We had very high hopes when it was passed,"" Mitchell said, ""although clearly it was a compromise reflecting the political circumstances which existed at the time, and it is very disappointing to see the efforts by the current administration, which in some respects have the effect of rolling back provisions of the act.""\ At issue: Emission law\ In August, the EPA changed a key provision of the Clean Air Act that was added in 1977. Called ""new source review,"" the provision requires older, dirtier power plants, refineries and factories that want to modernize their facilities to install up-to-date emission control technology.\ The EPA relaxed the rule, allowing up to 20 percent of the cost of repairs or expansions at these plants to be considered ""routine maintenance"" not requiring any new pollution-control technology.\ Environmentalists decried the change, saying that it essentially allows polluters to modernize their plants a little at a time in order to avoid spending money on emission controls. Maine's congressional delegation called the move ""a giant step backward"" in protecting New England's air quality.\ Maine has joined Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts in suing the federal government over its air pollution policies.\ Industry officials say they need the change in the new source review rule in order to make their facilities more efficient and keep energy costs down. They argue that under the old policy, facilities were discouraged from making needed repairs and replacing old equipment for fear of triggering expensive pollution-control upgrades.\ Maine's paper makers say the new policy is less ambiguous and will encourage more investments in their manufacturing plants that could actually reduce pollution, as well as improve efficiency. John Williams, president of the Maine Pulp and Paper Association, said there is now a clear standard for what is routine maintenance and what is a major improvement or expansion that requires upgrades under the Clean Air Act.\ ""Doing all of the studies and investing in new equipment can be very expensive,"" he said. ""The rules were never very clear and there was interpretation by the EPA that anything you did with the plant, even if you did it every year, you had to go through the process. The new changes clear that up. If you're doing things that really are routine, like replacing steam tubes, that doesn't require you to get a completely new permit.""\ One Maine paper company wanted to switch to natural gas to fuel its manufacturing plant, a move that would have reduced emissions, he said. It dropped the plan because of the expense of going through a review and relicensing, according to Williams.\ Williams said the law has discouraged investments in plants that are not the primary cause of air pollution. The real culprit, he said, are large power companies in the Midwestern states that send air pollution to New England and Maine. ""We think that's really what should be addressed,"" he said.\ What next?\ Many fear the Clean Air Act changes could allow those plants to discharge more pollution by avoiding new source review. But, Williams said, the rules shouldn't penalize other businesses, too.\ ""Here in Maine, our mills have done so much to clean the air,"" he said. ""Much of Maine's air pollution is caused by sources downwind, and trying to address those sources is something we support.""\ In a Sept. 16 meeting with reporters from regional newspapers, including the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, President Bush said his administration's version of new source review ""says you can modernize plants without having to either get sued or going through enormous amounts of bureaucratic litigation.\ ""You need to make your plant more efficient and more clean, so you can produce more energy to encourage job growth and at the same time protect the environment,"" he said.\ The Bush administration has also proposed legislation known as the ""Clear Skies Initiative"" that relies on a cap-and-trade program to cut power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury by nearly 70 percent over 2000 levels. (Cap-and-trade sets a limit on the total amount of pollution that can be emitted from all regulated sources. It lets sources choose how to reduce emissions, including buying additional allowances from other sources that reduce emissions.)\ But environmentalists question the EPA analyses underlying the proposal and say the initiative would actually increase air pollution. Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, and three other Democrats wrote to Bush two weeks ago, accusing him of misleading the public on the issue in his State of the Union address.\ ""Ed Muskie would be outraged"" by the changes proposed by Bush, said Don Nicoll of Portland. The former Muskie administrative assistant oversaw the senator's work on environmental legislation from 1963 through 1966 - work that led to the creation of the Clean Air Act.\ ""He probably wouldn't show his outrage publicly, but he would be critical and he would be incisive in attacking the (administration's) positions,"" Nicoll said. ""My guess is that he would be busy holding hearings around the country that would be designed to elicit the facts and mobilize people at the grass roots, something that isn't happening.""\ Marshall Burk of Winthrop, who lobbied for the Clean Air Act in 1970 when he was executive secretary of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said that as a Republican, he is ""very disappointed"" in Bush's air pollution policies.\ ""I think it's horrible what they've been doing,"" he said. ""I think it's ridiculous that anybody that cares for the quality of life in our country is allowing this to happen, and that's a quote you can use.""\ Crafting law took time\ The Clean Air Act was passed during the same year that Americans celebrated the first Earth Day. Muskie had worked throughout the 1960s to lay the scientific and constitutional groundwork for federal interest in air pollution control and protecting public health. Earth Day gave him the political muscle to move forward, Billings said.\ ""We were coming off a really difficult era following the war in Vietnam,"" Billings said, ""and people were looking for something to feel strongly about.""\ Billings thinks the successful passage of the Clean Air Act is attributable in part to the era in which it was born. It came four years before the Federal Election Reform Act, which created political action committees and linked money and lobbyists more strongly to the political process.\ Before 1974, most senators spent little time fund-raising and campaigned only for the last six months of their terms, Billings said. There was much more time to devote to the details of public policy. Members of Congress often went over legislation line by line themselves, instead of delegating that task to their staff.\ ""In 1970, the Clean Air Act was written in a back room,"" he said. ""The members were sitting around a table. There were no lobbyists present, there were no cameras present. There was a very small staff of four or five people, and between eight and 15 members, depending on who was there on any given day. They talked through these issues in great detail.""\ At one point, the act was the subject of 43 committee meetings and 45 conference committee meetings, Billings said. Today, members of Congress often see a bill and vote on it the same day.\ The bill that came out of that back room in 1970 has withstood constant attacks over the past 30 years. During the energy crisis in 1973 and 1974, opponents tried to use the oil embargo to gut the act, Billings recalled. There were more attempts at the end of the Carter administration.\ When the act was amended in 1977, industry fought the new source review provision ""more vigorously than anything I can remember,"" Billings said.\ ""In Maine, they sent the pulp and paper industry after Muskie,"" he said. ""I've got a great tape recording of a meeting he had with a consultant to the paper industry where there were a bunch of union guys in the room, and they tried everything to intimidate Muskie and failed. Not only did they fail, he became firmer on the subject rather than softer.""\ The provision made it into law, but it was largely ignored throughout the 1980s.\ There were more attempts to weaken the act in the 1980s, when President Reagan came into office. It was at this time that Mitchell began trying to push through another major revision of the act that would broaden its scope and strengthen it significantly. The entire process would take several years.\ ""All through the decade of the '80s, we were unable to move the legislation on amending or improving the Clean Air Act because of the opposition of President Reagan,"" Mitchell said.\ Bush Sr. commended\ Mitchell said he finds ""a huge irony"" in the current Bush administration's actions because it was the first Bush presidency that helped make the 1990 reauthorization possible. When the first President Bush came into office in 1989, he said he favored action on clean air, although he had different ideas on how best to do it.\ ""The first President Bush deserves a great deal of credit because it was his decision to move the administration from the adamant opposition position that had been taken by President Reagan to one of support for change, although there was disagreement over what that change should be,"" Mitchell said. ""So the whole focus shifted from whether there should be any improvement to what kind of improvement should there be.""\ The 1990 legislation took two months to fashion as the Senate committee on the environment negotiated with Bush officials. In some ways, the process resembled what had occurred 20 years before - Mitchell conducted negotiations in his office, behind closed doors. He invited every senator to participate, and most of them did at one time or another, Mitchell recalls.\ ""Both sides made principled compromises, and we made an agreement,"" he said. ""It was very difficult going. It was a very tough time.""\ In the end, they came out of the office with an act that was several hundred pages long, compared with the 41 pages of the original Clean Air Act. The bill included the first provisions to control acid rain, as well as new requirements for controlling air toxics, urban smog and pollutants that harm the Earth's ozone layer.\ ""There's an irony that the current president is undermining gains made really as a direct result of his father's actions,"" Mitchell said.\ Others who have fought for the Clean Air Act over the years are worried, too, though not convinced that attacks on the act will be successful in the long run.\ Burk is optimistic because the public is generally supportive of clean air issues and there are many experts willing to and able to discuss the hazards of air pollution to the environment and public health. Thirty years ago, he said, even many physicians were gun- shy about supporting the act because they were sympathetic to industry's economic arguments.\ ""I just can't believe that there aren't enough public health- oriented people, that (they) will allow the law to be weakened,"" he said.\ Billings said that rather than tampering with the underlying basis for the regulations - a common mode of attack in the past - the administration has now decided through new source review and other changes to ""just cease requiring the controls themselves."" He thinks the current tactics will lose in courts of law, as well as in the court of public opinion.\ ""I've always described the Clean Air Act as being a hot-stove issue,"" Billings said. ""You don't put your hand on it. If you do, you're going to get burned. These guys are trying to come in the back door, but I don't think they're going to be successful.""\ Staff Writer Meredith Goad can be contacted at 791-6332 or at:\ mgoad@pressherald.com"

The Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, during the height of public agitation over the degraded condition of our nation's skies. At the time, whole cities suffered from unhealthy brown hazes brought on by unregulated industrial pollution. And over time, the Clean Air Act changed this nation's landscape, from one that featured huge smokestacks belching toxic clouds into the skies to one where the air was vastly cleaner and more healthy to breathe.
\
The Act was originally designed to regulate the pollutants of the time, from carbon monoxide to ozone and sulfur dioxide. In subsequent years, as scientists and policymakers understood better just what could harm our environment, amendments added new pollutants to the list of those the federal government controlled.
\
For the last five years, the Bush administration's Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the Clean Air Act, put the brakes on regulating the things that harm our environment. As the dangers of global warming became more evident, the agency asserted that the Clean Air Act did not give it the authority to regulate greenhouse gases -- those carbon dioxide emissions that came from cars, trucks and other vehicles and which are known to be a significant contributor to global warming.
\
In 2003, the EPA refused to respond to a petition specifically requesting that they regulate greenhouse gas emissions. That provoked a number of states -- Maine among them -- to sue the EPA, claiming the agency was ignoring the Clean Air Act. They said the act allowed the agency to regulate any pollutant that can be determined to ""cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare."" Greenhouse gases, they said, fit that definition.
\
On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA did indeed have the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate auto emissions that cause greenhouse gasses. The strongly worded decision was a decisive rebuke to the Bush administration, which it accused of employing a ""laundry list of reasons not to regulate,"" and using the agency's discretion as a ""roving license to ignore the statutory text.""
\
We won't dwell on the Supreme Court's common sense in reaching this conclusion. The important issue is that with this ruling, it removed the paralysis afflicting the federal government on climate change.
\
Until the court ruled in this case, federal action was not forthcoming, despite being sorely needed. Instead, the action in this country on global warming shifted to the states. Maine has joined nine other states in a regional compact, for example, to regulate greenhouse gases using a market-based cap-and-trade approach; the program was designed to serve as a model for federal action once the Supreme Court swept away the administration's specious arguments.
\
That moment has arrived. But as much praise as we have for the foresight embodied in the Clean Air Act, it's also true that it would be a lot easier to regulate greenhouse gas emissions if Congress now moves to pass amendments that will specifically target those emissions. A lot of legal contorting would need to be done to cram greenhouse gas regulation into the existing contours of the act. It will be a lot easier, and a lot better, if Congress now chooses to deal directly with the most crucial environmental threat of our time, global warming.
\
To that end, Maine has a lot to offer; the cap-and-trade approach in the regional initiative that our state helped pioneer would serve well if put to use on a federal level. We urge the state's congressional delegation to press for these changes and to go even further than simply regulating auto emissions that contribute to greenhouse gases. Industrial carbon emissions need the same regulatory approach, and -- demonstrating how the Bush administration was way behind even the polluters -- leaders of those industries have already said in public they want to work on such a scheme to lower their emissions. There are no more excuses; it's only the flat-earth crowd who believe that global warming isn't a problem that we must try to control. It's time to get to work.

\
AUGUSTA -- Energy experts long have touted home weatherization as the best way to save money while reducing Maine's reliance on fossil fuels.
\
Now, state officials have developed a plan to potentially make money from Maine's aggressive weatherization efforts, using the growing international ""carbon market"" to help fund additional energy efficiency projects.
\
MaineHousing officials said this week that they have taken a step toward being able to sell ""carbon credits"" from greenhouse gas emissions reductions achieved through weatherization projects.
\
If completed, Maine's plan to sell credits from weatherization projects on the carbon market could set an international precedent. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits then would be reinvested in the state's energy efficiency and weatherization programs.
\
""We're the first in the world. We're not just the first state,"" said Dale McCormick, director of MaineHousing, the state's affordable housing agency.
\
Carbon dioxide has emerged as a type of commodity in recent years as governments and the private sector seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases linked to global warming.
\
Typically, one carbon credit equals 1 ton of carbon dioxide, and those credits are bought and sold as part of an emissions market intended to provide companies with a financial incentive to reduce emissions. Maine, for instance, is part of the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that placed a cap-and-trade system on fossil fuel-burning power plants.
\
Before selling carbon credits, Maine's system for quantifying the amount of carbon dioxide reduced as a result of weatherization projects must be validated by two independent accreditors.
\
In particular, validators are looking to make sure that Maine's CO2 reductions are real, verifiable, permanent and eligible for sale on the carbon market, which is where companies and traders buy and sell credits.
\
First Environment, one of the third-party accreditors, already has signed off on Maine's methodology. The state is in the process of seeking a second validation.
\
McCormick estimated that between MaineHousing and Efficiency Maine Trust programs, the state could sell 8,000 carbon credits a year. Exactly how much revenue that would produce is impossible to say, however, because the price of carbon credits fluctuates so much.
\
Peter Shattuck, a carbon markets policy analyst at the Maine-based nonprofit organization Environment Northeast, said he was interested in learning more about Maine's plan.
\
One key for the state, Shattuck said, will be to meet the stringent requirements for showing that the emissions reductions are, among other criteria, verifiable and stemmed from new projects that would not have been undertaken otherwise.
\
As an analogy, Shattuck said a power plant cannot earn carbon credits for shutting down an inefficient, coal-fired power plant that already was slated to be taken off line.
\
""In general, I think it's an intriguing financing mechanism for weatherization projects,"" Shattuck said.
\
McCormick said the idea behind attempting to sell carbon credits for weatherization projects began simply enough.
\
""We're saving energy when we weatherize homes, so we must be saving carbon as well, so why don't we sell it?"" McCormick said. ""We always need more money for weatherization.""
\
When those discussions began about two years ago, she and others assumed that someone already had developed a model that Maine could follow.
\
""But, in fact, nobody had because they have been concentrating on the low-hanging fruit, which in the carbon world is big power plants ... or methane recovery from [cattle] feed lots,"" McCormick said.
\
Compared to those industrial projects, carbon emission reductions from weatherization projects in Maine are relatively tiny. But when combined with credits from similar weatherization efforts in other states, they could become a sizable figure.
\
It was unclear Thursday on which carbon markets Maine would seek to sell the weatherization credits.
\
Upon members' return to Washington, D.C., Congress is expected to resume debate about a potential federal climate bill that could feature a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. Some supporters of federal climate legislation have suggested that the two-year-old Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative could serve as a model.
\
Under RGGI, the 10 participating states agreed to cap emissions levels from fossil fuel-burning power plants and then reduce those levels by 10 percent by 2018. Sales of the allowances or credits have generated more than $660 million for the 10 states, including more than $20 million for Maine.
"
59,"The administration put new weight Wednesday behind efforts to bring nationwide competition to the electricity industry, holding out the promise of saving consumers $20 billion a year and helping the environment.\Reaction to the administration proposal was mixed in Congress, where legislation for electric utility industry deregulation has been bogged down for months.\Rep. Dan Schaefer, R-Colo., chief sponsor of a House bill, said the administration's long-awaited proposal ""aids the process of getting legislation this year.""\But Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, said he had concerns about much of the administration's approach and would like to see proposed legislation - not an outline of ""principles"" - before moving forward.\The administration plan, announced by Energy Secretary Federico Pena, would call for open competition nationwide among electricity suppliers by 2003, but would allow states a way to ""opt out"" and not participate if they believe open competition is not to their benefit.\Some states where electricity prices already are low have expressed concern that competition might not be beneficial and might lead to reduced services.\Vice President Al Gore, in a statement, said the proposal, if accepted by Congress, would ""produce big benefits for both our economy and our environment"" and provide ""a down payment on the greenhouse gas reductions needed to avert global warming.""\At least 16 states, with California and some Northeastern states leading the way, already have moved toward opening their electricity markets over the next few years. Whether federal legislation is needed has been the subject of intense debate.\""Americans should have the right to choose their own electricity supplier,"" Pena said, arguing that national legislation is needed to deal with environmental concerns and ensure that low-income customers do not lose service and reliability and regional concerns are addressed.\""Choosing an electric supplier should not be any more difficult than choosing a box of cereal,"" he said.\The administration estimated that widespread competition among power suppliers would save consumers $20 billion a year - $230 per household - in direct electricity costs and indirect savings on products and services that benefit from the competition.\Some energy experts have questioned whether savings would be that great, arguing that consumers would still be saddled with paying for so-called ""stranded costs"" - leftover bills from a highly regulated industry, such as costs of building nuclear power plants.\The administration proposal would allow such costs to be passed on to customers under competition, although it would be left to individual states to determine to what extent the costs could be recovered.\Other key provisions in the administration proposal include:\Creation of a $3 billion federal revolving fund to promote conservation and continued assistance to low-income consumers. States would provide matching money and the federal fund would come from a 1/10th cent-per-kilowatt-hour surcharge to all electricity customers.\Requiring utilities to produce at least 5.5 percent of their electricity from renewable sources such as wind or solar.\Establish federal right-to-know disclosure requirements to protect electricity consumers in a competitive market and regulations to ensure reliability.\While environmentalists praised the conservation assistance fund, they expressed disappointment that the administration plan did not include more substantive measures to deal with global warming.\Electric utilities account for nearly a third of the leading greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, and environmentalists had hoped the proposal would call for direct regulation of carbon emissions.\Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner, who joined Pena at a news conference, said the EPA intends to work with Congress to pursue a carbon dioxide cap-and-trade program separate from the electricity restructuring issue."
60,"A fee paid in Maine to support green energy projects and energy-efficiency measures is supporting costly and ineffective efforts.\When is a tax not a tax? When it can be hidden under another name, of course. \Anyone who lives in one of nine Northeastern states, including Maine, and uses electricity pays for ""emission allowances"" to support ""green"" energy projects and efficiency programs under a six-year-old law called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, commonly pronounced ""Reggie."" \It used to be in 10 states, but in 2011, Republican Gov. Chris Christie took New Jersey out of the compact. \The New York Times quoted Christie as saying, ""RGGI does nothing more than tax electricity, tax our citizens (and) tax our businesses, with no discernible or measurable impact upon our environment."" \When the program took effect in 2008, the Times noted, ""Ten Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states ranging from Maine to Maryland set a ceiling on carbon dioxide emissions (that would) require power plants to purchase credits or allowances that allow them to emit specified amounts of carbon dioxide."" \Under the ""cap-and-trade"" program, it said, ""companies that cut their emissions below their designated caps are permitted to sell or trade their excess carbon allowances in online auctions."" \But Christie called RGGI ""a failure,"" noting that ""power suppliers have easily met their caps, and carbon allowances are trading at bottom-level prices because plants are taking advantage of cheap prices for natural gas, which is less polluting than fuels like coal."" \However, the government had a ""fix"" for RGGI's woeful ineffectiveness: Raise the cost of the permits. \A new analysis of the program, prepared jointly by the Maine Heritage Policy Center and the Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University (two think tanks that make no apologies for defending the free market), says, ""RGGI changed its 'Model Rule' to cut the number of allowances available for auction by almost half. ... As a result, allowance prices increased dramatically,"" potentially tripling by 2020. \Needless to say, it's not the power companies that pay for those permits. Ratepayers are the ones on the hook, and Mainers have paid $48 million into the program since 2008. \What happens to the money? State governments ""invest"" it in projects favored by politicians and bureaucrats, including high-cost but low-return wind and solar projects and energy-efficiency programs directed not by consumer choice but by government-approved grants to companies favored by the states. \In Maine, at least, 35 percent of RGGI payments will go to subsidize home energy upgrades and conversions for the next three years. \Many may think those purposes are worthwhile, but if these programs are good ideas, they should be supported by taxes whose purposes are openly linked to their outcomes. That's just simple honesty. \But the justification for charging us for these ""allowances"" is false for two reasons: \n First, RGGI, as Christie noted, fails in its reason for existing, as it has no impact on the environment that anyone can determine. \While global warming theorists say CO2 emissions will inevitably lead to higher temperatures, a 30 percent increase since the 1850s has produced no discernible warming for almost two decades. \And CO2 emissions in the United States have been dropping without any national ""cap-and-trade"" program (which Congress has refused to pass), partly because of the recent business downturn but primarily because of the widespread adoption of cleaner natural gas for power generation. \n Second, the emissions saved by RGGI are ""a rounding error of a rounding error"" when viewed globally, as Beacon Hill's director of research, Paul Bachman, told a Maine Heritage Policy Center gathering last week. \With China, India and other nations building new coal-fired power plants by the hundreds, what Maine saves is metaphorically equivalent to taking a pail of water out of Sebago Lake. \And yet, RGGI is costly: According to the Maine Heritage Policy Center/Beacon Hill analysis, a Maine withdrawal from RGGI would save consumers ""$106 million to $132 million from 2015 to 2020; raise employment by an expected 270 to 330 jobs over the period; increase Mainers' real disposable income by $10 million to $11 million; and boost investment by $5 million to $6 million."" \(The studies claiming these savings are available on the www.mainepolicy.org/ and www.beaconhill.org websites.) \RGGI's defenders dispute those figures, using thumb-on-the-scale economic models that claim a huge ""multiplier effect"" for government spending while simultaneously minimizing the effects of private investment. \As with any dueling studies, you can pick whichever one you like. But let's set aside liberals' self-serving claims that the think tanks are ""biased"" while tax-hiking bureaucrats and lawmakers are ""objective."" \As if. Instead, progressive politicians wanted to raise money for their pet ""green"" programs, but figured that might not be an easy sell to taxpayers. \So they disguised their tax-and-spend programs under the camouflage of ""global warming,"" raising taxes behind a smokescreen of environmental virtue. \Christie saw through it, and saved his state's consumers tens of millions of dollars. Why can't we do that for Mainers? M.D. Harmon, a retired journalist and military officer, is a freelance writer and speaker. He can be contacted at: mdharmoncol@yahoo.com"
61,"David Emery knows what it's like to face an incumbent in Maine's 1st Congressional District.\From fundraising to name recognition, the odds are overwhelmingly in favor of the person already in office.\As a 26-year-old electrical engineer from Rockland in 1974, Emery went up against Democrat Peter Kyros, a four-term congressman from Portland.\This was the first election after the resignation of President Nixon following two years of a widening Watergate scandal, so it wasn't a great year to be Republican. Indeed, Democrats would gain five seats in the Senate and 49 in the House.\""Even though on the surface, you'd have said a Republican challenger would have no chance against a Democratic incumbent, Congress was extraordinarily unpopular,"" Emery said. ""Incumbents were in danger for a variety of reasons,"" including high inflation and high unemployment.\Emery spent the summer walking through southern Maine, knocking on doors, shaking hands, conversing outside garages.\""I just worked my tail off that summer and fall,"" he said. ""And as I recall, Peter didn't even have any TV ads. I don't think he was worried at all.""\The results of a poll published two days before the election in the Maine Sunday Telegram revealed no hint of what lay ahead. Kyros held a 59 percent to 41 percent advantage, according to the telephone survey of 406 voters, and the three-way gubernatorial race surely belonged to a former aide of Sen. Edmund Muskie named George Mitchell, who led Republican James Erwin by 9 points and independent James Longley by 19.\Instead, on the first Tuesday of November, Maine voters elected both Emery (barely) and Longley (by 3 percentage points over Mitchell).\Wrote Jim Brunelle in the former Evening Express: ""Kyros's loss was wholly unexpected and demonstrated the depth of the public's perverse mood at the current state of political affairs, a mood which has also helped to carry an independent candidate into the governorship for the first time in 120 years.""\""I think (Kyros) was the most surprised man in the state of Maine on election night,"" said Emery, who survived a recount that reduced his margin of victory to 432 votes. ""And I would have been right behind him.""\Emery went on to serve eight years in Congress before losing a Senate bid in 1982 (to Mitchell, who seems to have shrugged off that '74 loss). Now 62, Emery emceed a fundraiser two weeks ago in Falmouth featuring former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins.\Their aim? To help another underdog Republican, Dean Scontras of Eliot, in his bid to unseat Rep. Chellie Pingree, the Democratic incumbent from North Haven who won office in 2008 after four years as head of Common Cause, a national nonpartisan government-reform lobbying group.\""I think he's made a favorable impression,"" Emery said of Scontras, who lost the Republican primary to Charlie Summers of Scarborough for this same seat two years ago. ""Just looking at his growth over the past couple years, I'm impressed with the organization he's built. He's focusing on change in Washington and on economic issues.""\PINGREE WELL KNOWN\Pingree's story is well known in Maine. She grew up in Minnesota, moved as a teenager to an island in Penobscot Bay, spent some time at the University of Southern Maine and eventually earned a degree in human ecology from the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor.\After graduation, she returned to North Haven - located about 12 miles off the coast of Rockland and boasting a year-round population of about 400 - and farmed.\She raised pigs and chickens. She sold vegetables from a stand, and later added sweaters knitted by island women. She started a company, North Island Designs, that employed about a dozen local women, selling sweaters, sweater-making kits and knitting books, mostly by mail.\""Knitting started my political career,"" she told satirist Stephen Colbert, on whose television show Pingree appeared last August, as Colbert threw his head back in mock boredom after raising the subject.\That political career began at the municipal level, on the school board and planning board and as the island's tax assessor.\Voters in Knox County sent her to the state Senate, where she became majority leader and spearheaded Maine's first-in-the-nation law aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs to state residents.\After term limits ended her state Senate career at eight years, Pingree lost a 2002 U.S. Senate bid to unseat Collins and was appointed president of Common Cause.\At 55, Pingree is a divorced mother of three adult children, has one grandchild and another on the way - courtesy of her eldest daughter, Hannah Pingree, who is currently speaker of the Maine House and nearing the end of her fourth and final term.\""It's been an interesting year to be a member of Congress,"" Pingree said Friday from her Portland office. ""There have been so many issues to tackle, from finding ways to bring jobs to the state of Maine, to exploring ways to develop renewable energy, to cracking down on credit card companies and banks, to working on the health care bill and trying to bring down the cost of health care.""\She said the most gratifying aspect of the job might be the daily interactions with constituents, helping them with a variety of issues, large and small.\""We get a lot of calls,"" she said. ""You get to dig in and solve problems.""\Two she mentioned were helping navigate red tape for a Maine vessel loaded with relief supplies bound for victims of the Haiti earthquake and intervening on behalf of veterans with claims being denied by an insurance company, thanks to a tip from a former Togus accountant.\""To me, it's the problem-solving end,"" she said. ""Those sometimes feel like the biggest accomplishments, even though they're not the things you see on the nightly news.""\A member of the Armed Services and Rules committees, Pingree is also Maine's lone representative in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a coalition of 80 Democrats and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that advocates, among other things, universal access to health care, an increased minimum wage, legalization of same-sex marriage, strict campaign finance reform, an increase in welfare spending and cuts in military spending.\An independent poll conducted a week ago by the Portland firm Critical Insights for MaineToday Media showed Pingree with a lead of 24 percentage points over Scontras - 53 percent to 29 percent - with 17 percent of 1st District voters undecided.\Pingree also holds a significant advantage in campaign funds. As of the latest reporting period at the end of June, she had raised nearly $700,000 and spent less than half of it. Scontras, whose only previous political experience was the unsuccessful primary bid in 2008, entered July having raised $152,320 and had a little more than $67,000 on hand.\""She raised a lot of money from outside the state,"" Scontras said. ""I've tried to do this organically, homegrown, with as many Maine supporters as I can.""\Indeed, an analysis of Pingree's totals by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics shows that 85 percent of her contributions of more than $200 have come from away. The largest percentage originated from the New York metropolitan area.\The breakdown for Scontras is 74 percent of such contributions coming from Maine, which is to be expected for a challenger without wide name recognition outside the state.\CHALLENGE FOR SCONTRAS\Building such name recognition, even within the state, is the challenge facing Scontras, who turns 41 next month. He grew up in Kittery as the youngest of seven children, the grandson of Greek immigrants, starred in two sports at Traip Academy and played football at the University of Maine, which won a share of two Yankee Conference titles during his years in Orono. He still wears a championship ring.\After graduating in 1991 with a degree in public management with a minor in political science, Scontras moved to Washington and embarked on a series of sales and marketing jobs with several high-tech companies.\In 1997 he enrolled in a masters of liberal arts program at Georgetown University, concentrating on public policy, and completed 24 of 30 credits required for a degree.\Married, with two young children, he returned to Maine in 2005 and is head of business development for the alternative-energy company Ra Power Solutions, based in Cape Neddick.\The company is involved with a variety of energy-related ventures including wind farms, refrigerator-sized turbines that run on natural gas, and co-generation of power.\""Trust me, my little stint with alternative energy has not won me a lot of fans in the Republican Party, but I believe in it,"" he said. ""I was with some oil folks the other day and it got very contested.""\Even so, Scontras opposes cap-and-trade legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, and on the issue of global warming, describes himself as ""agnostic.""\""I think we've all got to be good stewards of the environment, but to say we have to pass cap-and-trade to get us there is not right, either.""\Pingree voted last summer in favor of cap-and-trade legislation.\On economic issues, the candidates differ widely. Scontras supports elimination of the federal estate tax. He supports extending the Bush tax cuts due to expire at the end of this year for all income groups.\What he'd really like to do, however, is replace the income tax with a flat tax on consumption. His view, based on that of former comptroller general David M. Walker, is that lower taxes result in higher revenue.\""Think about it,"" he said. ""The income tax taxes capital and labor. The harder you work and the more money you make, the more you get taxed. ... I will always work with the principle that, if it increases revenue to the Treasury, then that's where we need to be to cut deficits and reel in the debt. As a business, that's how you'd operate: Where am I getting my most revenue?""\Pingree opposes elimination of the estate tax and support's President Obama's plan to extend the Bush tax cuts for individuals making less than $200,000 per year and couples making less than $250,000.\She cited the view of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner that ""extending tax cuts for the wealthy is a $700 billion addition to our deficit"" over a decade.\Pingree thinks the health care reform law doesn't go far enough, whereas Scontras would work to repeal it. He favors incremental changes rather than ""something so broad, so encompassing and so sweeping, that it changes the entire industry.""\She favors gun control. He does not. She supports a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. He is against granting amnesty.\After speaking out strongly on social issues in the 2008 primary that saw Republican voters opt for the more moderate Summers, Scontras deflected questions on abortion and same-sex marriage, saying the former already has been decided by the Supreme Court and the latter is a states-rights issue.\""I am pro-life,"" Scontras said, ""but I'm also a realist that (a woman's right to choose) is the law of the land.""\Pingree is strongly pro-choice and an outspoken proponent of gay rights.\More nuanced descriptions of their positions are available on the nonpartisan Web site votesmart.org, although both candidates declined to fill out a questionnaire from the site despite repeated requests.\WILL HISTORY REPEAT?\In the six weeks remaining before the general election, Scontras will continue to tell his story, continue to rail about the rising national debt and continue to preach fiscal restraint.\He may be trailing in the polls, but incumbents aren't unbeatable in the 1st District. Since redistricting after the 1960 census reduced Maine's contingent from three representatives to two, incumbents seeking re-election have won 16 out of 18 times, with former Portland Mayor Tom Allen's 1996 defeat of James Longley Jr. after one term joining Emery's 1974 upset.\""It was a long time ago, but it was a year not unlike this year,"" Emery said.

62," President Bush's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency isn't likely to face real opposition from Congress, but Steve Johnson, a longtime EPA staffer, should expect lots of questions from Maine's senators. They should expect detailed answers.\ Although it is clear the Bush administration is moving forward with rules that weaken many environmental protections, it is important that these changes get as much scrutiny as possible. Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins have long histories of providing such scrutiny and they should continue to do so.\ The senators will likely ask why the administration proposed rules on mercury pollution that are not as stringent as possible, especially in light of last month's report from EPA's inspector general finding that the proposed mercury rules were developed by working backward from a predetermined standard favored by industry. The rule, announced Tuesday, calls for a 70 percent reduction in mercury emission by 2018. In 2001, the agency estimated that mercury emissions could be reduced by 90 percent if the best available technology were used.\ Sen. Snowe joined with Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont in writing to the EPA last week to express their opposition to the mercury rules. ""EPA's mercury proposals fell far short of what the law requires and that the proposed approach fails to protect the health of our children and our environment,"" the senators wrote.\ Currently, 45 states have fish warnings for mercury, and EPA and the Food and Drug Administration warn women of childbearing age, nursing mothers and young children from eating more than six ounces a week of fish caught in local waterways. In Maine, 19 rivers and lakes have been under such advisories for a decade.\ The senators should want to know how the EPA can continue to support the president's Clear Skies package, which was held up by a committee deadlock, when the existing Clean Air Act and other proposals would result in bigger and quicker reductions in pollution. The Clean Power Act, sponsored by Sen. Collins, would set a more rigorous timetable and allow for more local control, an important issue for Maine, which has had to go to court to try to compel the EPA to enforce existing pollution regulations.\ On the issue of climate change, they will wonder why the administration has been slow to fund research into its causes and consequences. The Climate Stewardship Act, sponsored by Sen. Snowe, would set up a cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent greenhouse gas. It would require the head of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop rules to reduce emissions from the electricity generation, transportation, manufacturing and commercial sectors, which account for 85 percent of U.S. greenhouse gases.\ Mr. Johnson is in the unenviable position of taking over an embattled agency in the midst of congressional wrangling over a cornerstone of the administration's pollution policy. Given the importance of recent and impending regulatory decisions, senators would be remiss if they didn't take this opportunity to express their concern and, often, displeasure with the agency's direction."
63,"
One of the most important events of our lifetimes may have just transpired. A federal agency has decided that it has the power to regulate everything, including the air you breathe.
\
Nominally, the Environmental Protection Agency's announcement last Friday only applies to new-car emissions. But pretty much everyone agrees that the ruling opens the door to regulating, well, everything.
\
According to the EPA, greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide - the gas you exhale - as well as methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. It is literally impossible to imagine a significant economic or human activity that does not involve the production of one of these gases. Don't think just of the gas and electricity bills. Cow flatulence is a serious concern of the EPA's already. What next? Perhaps an EPA mandarin will pick up a copy of ""The Greenpeace Guide to Environmentally Friendly Sex"" and go after the root causes of global warming.
\
Whether or not global warming is a crisis that warrants immediate, drastic action (I don't think it does), and whether or not such wholesale measures would be an economic calamity (they would be), the EPA's decision should be disturbing to people who believe in democratic, constitutional government.
\
Two years ago, the Supreme Court - the least democratic branch of our formal government - decided in Massachusetts v. EPA that the agency could regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. With this judicial green light, the EPA has launched its power grab over all that burns, breathes, burps, flies, drives and passes gas.
\
Yes, the head of the EPA reports to the president, which gives some patina of democratic accountability. Except the EPA is supposed to be politically autonomous, doing what it thinks best according to what President Obama calls ""sound science."" So the government bureaucracy is on its way to strong-arming the economy in ways Congress never imagined when it passed the Clean Air Act in 1970. Or the president has suddenly gained sweeping new powers over American life, in ways never imagined by Congress or the founders, and despite the fact that these new powers were never put before the voters.
\
This is not a sudden development. Vast swaths of the state have been on autopilot for years, effectively immune to democratic influence. The Federal Reserve, particularly of late, has been acting like the fourth branch of government. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, without congressional, presidential or court approval, has been committing trillions of dollars to fix the financial crisis. That may be warranted; only time will tell. But there's still something troubling about an institution so immune to democratic control.
\
In 2002, Congress created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. It covers its expenses by taxing all publicly traded corporations. It alone determines the amount to tax, without approval of the White House or, more important, Congress, which, according to the Constitution, has the sole authority to levy taxes: ""All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives"" (Article 1, Section 7). In 1999, the Federal Communications Commission raised the so-called Gore tax on long-distance phone calls by 73 percent without seeking congressional approval. Lord knows what the EPA could collect by extorting ""climate criminals.""
\
In fairness, the Obama administration and congressional Democrats reportedly don't want to cede authority to the EPA. Rather, they want to use the threat of an EPA takeover - and its presumably draconian impositions on business - to force reluctant moderate Democratic and Republican members of Congress to sign on to the president's cap-and-trade scheme (itself an enormous energy tax).
\
California's Barbara Boxer, who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has said as much: ""EPA, through its scientists, has given us a warning that global warming pollution is a clear, present and future danger to America's families. If Congress does not act to pass legislation, then I will call on the EPA to take all steps authorized by law to protect our families.""
\
Translation: Either you vote our way or we'll render voting meaningless.
\
Other Democrats are delighted by the EPA decision because it allows them to have their preferred policy - carbon regulation - without actually having to vote for it.
\
Either way, it doesn't sound like these folks take their oaths of office very seriously.Jonah Goldberg is a syndicated columnist. His e-mail address is: JonahsColumn@aol.com.

\
Pingree well-known
\
Pingree's story is well-known in Maine. She grew up in Minnesota, moved as a teenager to an island in Penobscot Bay, spent some time at the University of Southern Maine and eventually earned a degree in human ecology from the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor.
\
After graduation, she returned to North Haven -- located about 12 miles off the coast of Rockland and boasting a year-round population of about 400 -- and farmed.
\
She raised pigs and chickens. She sold vegetables from a stand, and later added sweaters knitted by island women. She started a company, North Island Designs, that employed about a dozen local women, selling sweaters, sweater-making kits and knitting books, mostly by mail.
\
""Knitting started my political career,"" she told satirist Stephen Colbert, on whose television show Pingree appeared last August, as Colbert threw his head back in mock boredom after raising the subject.
\
That political career began at the municipal level, on the school board and planning board and as the island's tax assessor.
\
Voters in Knox County sent her to the state Senate, where she became majority leader and spearheaded Maine's first-in-the-nation law aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs to state residents.
\
After term limits ended her state Senate career at eight years, Pingree lost a 2002 U.S. Senate bid to unseat Collins and was appointed president of Common Cause.
\
At 55, Pingree is a divorced mother of three adult children, has one grandchild and another on the way -- courtesy of her eldest daughter, Hannah Pingree, who is currently speaker of the Maine House and nearing the end of her fourth and final term.
\
""It's been an interesting year to be a member of Congress,"" Pingree said Friday from her Portland office. ""There have been so many issues to tackle, from finding ways to bring jobs to the state of Maine, to exploring ways to develop renewable energy, to cracking down on credit card companies and banks, to working on the health care bill and trying to bring down the cost of health care.""
\
She said the most gratifying aspect of the job might be the daily interactions with constituents, helping them with a variety of issues, large and small.
\
""We get a lot of calls,"" she said. ""You get to dig in and solve problems.""
\
Two she mentioned were helping navigate red tape for a Maine vessel loaded with relief supplies bound for victims of the Haiti earthquake and intervening on behalf of veterans with claims being denied by an insurance company, thanks to a tip from a former Togus accountant.
\
""To me, it's the problem-solving end,"" she said. ""Those sometimes feel like the biggest accomplishments, even though they're not the things you see on the nightly news.""
\
A member of the Armed Services and Rules committees, Pingree is also Maine's lone representative in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a coalition of 80 Democrats and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that advocates, among other things, universal access to health care, an increased minimum wage, legalization of same-sex marriage, strict campaign finance reform, an increase in welfare spending and cuts in military spending.
\
An independent poll conducted a week ago by the Portland firm Critical Insights for MaineToday Media showed Pingree with a lead of 24 percentage points over Scontras -- 53 percent to 29 percent -- with 17 percent of 1st District voters undecided.
\
Pingree also holds a significant advantage in campaign funds. As of the latest reporting period at the end of June, she had raised nearly $700,000 and spent less than half of it. Scontras, whose only previous political experience was the unsuccessful primary bid in 2008, entered July having raised $152,320 and had a little more than $67,000 on hand.
\
""She raised a lot of money from outside the state,"" Scontras said. ""I've tried to do this organically, homegrown, with as many Maine supporters as I can.""
\
Indeed, an analysis of Pingree's totals by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics shows that 85 percent of her contributions of more than $200 have come from away, with the largest percentage originating from the New York metropolitan area.
\
The breakdown for Scontras is 74 percent of such contributions coming from Maine, which is to be expected for a challenger without wide name recognition outside the state.
\
Challenge for Scontras
\
Building such name recognition, even within the state, is the challenge facing Scontras, who turns 41 next month. He grew up in Kittery as the youngest of seven children, the grandson of Greek immigrants, starred in two sports at Traip Academy and played football at the University of Maine, which won a share of two Yankee Conference titles during his years in Orono. He still wears a championship ring.
\
After graduating in 1991 with a degree in public management with a minor in political science, Scontras moved to Washington and embarked on a series of sales and marketing jobs with several high-tech companies.
\
In 1997, he enrolled in a masters of liberal arts program at Georgetown University, concentrating on public policy, and completed 24 of 30 credits required for a degree.
\
Married, with two young children, he returned to Maine in 2005 and is head of business development for the alternative-energy company Ra Power Solutions, based in Cape Neddick.
\
The company is involved with a variety of energy-related ventures, including wind farms, refrigerator-sized turbines that run on natural gas, and co-generation of power.
\
""Trust me, my little stint with alternative energy has not won me a lot of fans in the Republican Party, but I believe in it,"" he said. ""I was with some oil folks the other day and it got very contested.""
\
Even so, Scontras opposes cap-and-trade legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, and on the issue of global warming, describes himself as ""agnostic.""
\
""I think we've all got to be good stewards of the environment, but to say we have to pass cap-and-trade to get us there is not right, either.""
\
Pingree voted last summer in favor of cap-and-trade legislation.
\
On economic issues, the candidates differ widely. Scontras supports elimination of the federal estate tax. He supports extending the Bush tax cuts due to expire at the end of this year for all income groups.
\
What he'd really like to do, however, is replace the income tax with a flat tax on consumption. His view, based on that of former comptroller general David M. Walker, is that lower taxes result in higher revenue.

As a business, that's how you'd operate: Where am I getting my most revenue?""
\
Pingree opposes elimination of the estate tax and support's President Obama's plan to extend the Bush tax cuts for individuals making less than $200,000 per year and couples making less than $250,000.
\
She cited the view of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner that ""extending tax cuts for the wealthy is a $700 billion addition to our deficit"" over the next decade.
\
Pingree thinks the health care reform law doesn't go far enough, whereas Scontras would work to repeal it. He favors incremental changes rather than ""something so broad, so encompassing and so sweeping, that it changes the entire industry.""
\
She favors gun control. He does not. She supports a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. He is against granting amnesty.
\
After speaking out strongly on social issues in the 2008 primary that saw Republican voters opt for the more moderate Summers, Scontras deflected questions on abortion and same-sex marriage, saying the former already has been decided by the Supreme Court and the latter is a states-rights issue.
\
""I am pro-life,"" Scontras said, ""but I'm also a realist that (a woman's right to choose) is the law of the land.""
\
Pingree is strongly pro-choice and an outspoken proponent of gay rights.
\
More nuanced descriptions of their positions are available on the nonpartisan Web site votesmart.org, although both candidates declined to fill out a questionnaire from the site despite repeated requests.
\
Will history repeat?
\
In the six weeks remaining before the general election, Scontras will continue to tell his story, continue to rail about the rising national debt and continue to preach fiscal restraint.

He may be trailing in the polls, but incumbents aren't unbeatable in the 1st District. Since redistricting after the 1960 census reduced Maine's contingent from three representatives to two, incumbents seeking re-election have won 16 out of 18 times, with former Portland Mayor Tom Allen's 1996 defeat of James Longley Jr. after one term joining Emery's 1974 upset.
\
""It was a long time ago, but it was a year not unlike this year,"" Emery said.
\
""You just have to work as hard as you can to put yourself in position to win. Against a well-funded incumbent, it's always an uphill battle.""

Portland Press Herald
\
David Emery knows what it's like to face an incumbent in Maine's 1st Congressional District.
\
From fundraising to name recognition, the odds are overwhelmingly in favor of the person already in office.
\
As a 26-year-old electrical engineer from Rockland in 1974, Emery went up against Democrat Peter Kyros, a four-term congressman from Portland.
\
This was the first election after the resignation of President Nixon following two years of a widening Watergate scandal, so it wasn't a great year to be Republican. Indeed, Democrats would gain five seats in the Senate and 49 in the House.
\
""Even though on the surface, you'd have said a Republican challenger would have no chance against a Democratic incumbent, Congress was extraordinarily unpopular,"" Emery said. ""Incumbents were in danger for a variety of reasons,"" including high inflation and high unemployment.
\
Emery spent the summer walking through southern Maine, knocking on doors, shaking hands, conversing outside garages.
\
""I just worked my tail off that summer and fall,"" he said. ""And as I recall, Peter didn't even have any TV ads. I don't think he was worried at all.""
\
The results of a poll published two days before the election in the Maine Sunday Telegram revealed no hint of what lay ahead. Kyros held a 59 percent to 41 percent advantage, according to the telephone survey of 406 voters, and the three-way gubernatorial race surely belonged to a former aide of Sen. Edmund Muskie named George Mitchell, who led Republican James Erwin by 9 points and independent James Longley by 19.
\
Instead, on the first Tuesday of November, Maine voters elected both Emery (barely) and Longley (by 3 percentage points over Mitchell).
\
Wrote Jim Brunelle in the former Evening Express: ""Kyros's loss was wholly unexpected and demonstrated the depth of the public's perverse mood at the current state of political affairs, a mood which has also helped to carry an independent candidate into the governorship for the first time in 120 years.""
\
""I think (Kyros) was the most surprised man in the state of Maine on election night,"" said Emery, who survived a recount that reduced his margin of victory to 432 votes. ""And I would have been right behind him.""
\
Emery went on to serve eight years in Congress before losing a Senate bid in 1982 (to Mitchell, who seems to have shrugged off that '74 loss). Now 62, Emery emceed a fundraising event two weeks ago in Falmouth featuring former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins.
\
Their aim? To help another underdog Republican, Dean Scontras, of Eliot, in his bid to unseat Rep. Chellie Pingree, the Democratic incumbent from North Haven who won office in 2008 after four years as head of Common Cause, a national nonpartisan government-reform lobbying group.
\
""I think he's made a favorable impression,"" Emery said of Scontras, who lost the Republican primary to Charlie Summers of Scarborough for this same seat two years ago. ""Just looking at his growth over the past couple years, I'm impressed with the organization he's built. He's focusing on change in Washington and on economic issues.""
\
Pingree well-known
\
Pingree's story is well-known in Maine. She grew up in Minnesota, moved as a teenager to an island in Penobscot Bay, spent some time at the University of Southern Maine and eventually earned a degree in human ecology from the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor.
\
After graduation, she returned to North Haven -- about 12 miles off the coast of Rockland and boasting a year-round population of about 400 -- and farmed.
\
She raised pigs and chickens. She sold vegetables from a stand, and later added sweaters knitted by island women. She started a company, North Island Designs, that employed about a dozen local women, selling sweaters, sweater-making kits and knitting books, mostly by mail.
\
""Knitting started my political career,"" she told satirist Stephen Colbert, on whose television show Pingree appeared last August, as Colbert threw his head back in mock boredom after raising the subject.
\
That political career began at the municipal level, on the school board and planning board and as the island's tax assessor.
\
Voters in Knox County sent her to the state Senate, where she became majority leader and spearheaded Maine's first-in-the-nation law aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs to state residents.
\
After term limits ended her state Senate career at eight years, Pingree lost a 2002 U.S. Senate bid to unseat Collins and was appointed president of Common Cause.
\
At 55, Pingree is a divorced mother of three adult children, has one grandchild and another on the way -- courtesy of her eldest daughter, Hannah Pingree, who is currently speaker of the Maine House and nearing the end of her fourth and final term.
\
""It's been an interesting year to be a member of Congress,"" Pingree said Friday from her Portland office. ""There have been so many issues to tackle, from finding ways to bring jobs to the state of Maine, to exploring ways to develop renewable energy, to cracking down on credit card companies and banks, to working on the health care bill and trying to bring down the cost of health care.""
\
She said the most gratifying aspect of the job might be the daily interactions with constituents, helping them with a variety of issues, large and small.
\
""We get a lot of calls,"" she said. ""You get to dig in and solve problems.""
\
Two she mentioned were helping navigate red tape for a Maine vessel loaded with relief supplies bound for victims of the Haiti earthquake and intervening on behalf of veterans with claims being denied by an insurance company, thanks to a tip from a former Togus accountant.
\
""To me, it's the problem-solving end,"" she said. ""Those sometimes feel like the biggest accomplishments, even though they're not the things you see on the nightly news.""
\
A member of the Armed Services and Rules committees, Pingree is also Maine's lone representative in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a coalition of 80 Democrats and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that advocates, among other things, universal access to health care, an increased minimum wage, legalization of same-sex marriage, strict campaign finance reform, an increase in welfare spending and cuts in military spending.
\
An independent poll conducted a week ago by the Portland firm Critical Insights for MaineToday Media showed Pingree with a lead of 24 percentage points over Scontras -- 53 percent to 29 percent -- with 17 percent of 1st District voters undecided.
\
Pingree also holds a significant advantage in campaign funds. As of the latest reporting period at the end of June, she had raised nearly $700,000 and spent less than half of it. Scontras, whose only previous political experience was the unsuccessful primary bid in 2008, entered July having raised $152,320 and had a little more than $67,000 on hand.
\
""She raised a lot of money from outside the state,"" Scontras said. ""I've tried to do this organically, homegrown, with as many Maine supporters as I can.""
\
Indeed, an analysis of Pingree's totals by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics shows that 85 percent of her contributions of more than $200 have come from away, with the largest percentage originating from the New York metropolitan area.
\
The breakdown for Scontras is 74 percent of such contributions coming from Maine, which is to be expected for a challenger without wide name recognition outside the state.
\
Challenge for Scontras
\
Building such name recognition, even within the state, is the challenge facing Scontras, who turns 41 next month. He grew up in Kittery as the youngest of seven children, the grandson of Greek immigrants, starred in two sports at Traip Academy and played football at the University of Maine, which won a share of two Yankee Conference titles during his years in Orono. He still wears a championship ring.
\
After graduating in 1991 with a degree in public management with a minor in political science, Scontras moved to Washington and embarked on a series of sales and marketing jobs with several high-tech companies.
\
In 1997, he enrolled in a masters of liberal arts program at Georgetown University, concentrating on public policy, and completed 24 of 30 credits required for a degree.
\
Married, with two young children, he returned to Maine in 2005 and is head of business development for the alternative-energy company Ra Power Solutions, based in Cape Neddick.
\
The company is involved with a variety of energy-related ventures, including wind farms, refrigerator-sized turbines that run on natural gas, and co-generation of power.
\
""Trust me, my little stint with alternative energy has not won me a lot of fans in the Republican Party, but I believe in it,"" he said. ""I was with some oil folks the other day and it got very contested.""
\
Even so, Scontras opposes cap-and-trade legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, and on the issue of global warming, describes himself as ""agnostic.""
\
""I think we've all got to be good stewards of the environment, but to say we have to pass cap-and-trade to get us there is not right, either.""
\
Pingree voted last summer in favor of cap-and-trade legislation.
\
On economic issues, the candidates differ widely. Scontras supports elimination of the federal estate tax. He supports extending the Bush tax cuts due to expire at the end of this year for all income groups.
\
What he'd really like to do, however, is replace the income tax with a flat tax on consumption. His view, based on that of former comptroller general David M. Walker, is that lower taxes result in higher revenue.
\
""Think about it,"" he said. ""The income tax taxes capital and labor. The harder you work and the more money you make, the more you get taxed. ... I will always work with the principle that, if it increases revenue to the Treasury, then that's where we need to be to cut deficits and reel in the debt. As a business, that's how you'd operate: Where am I getting my most revenue?""
\
Pingree opposes elimination of the estate tax and support's President Obama's plan to extend the Bush tax cuts for individuals making less than $200,000 per year and couples making less than $250,000.
\
She cited the view of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner that ""extending tax cuts for the wealthy is a $700 billion addition to our deficit"" over the next decade.
\
Pingree thinks the health care reform law doesn't go far enough, whereas Scontras would work to repeal it. He favors incremental changes rather than ""something so broad, so encompassing and so sweeping, that it changes the entire industry.""
\
She favors gun control. He does not. She supports a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. He is against granting amnesty.
\
After speaking out strongly on social issues in the 2008 primary that saw Republican voters opt for the more moderate Summers, Scontras deflected questions on abortion and same-sex marriage, saying the former already has been decided by the Supreme Court and the latter is a states-rights issue.
\
""I am pro-life,"" Scontras said, ""but I'm also a realist that (a woman's right to choose) is the law of the land.""
\
Pingree is strongly pro-choice and an outspoken proponent of gay rights.
\
More nuanced descriptions of their positions are available on the nonpartisan Web site votesmart.org, although both candidates declined to fill out a questionnaire from the site despite repeated requests.
\
Will history repeat?
\
In the six weeks remaining before the general election, Scontras will continue to tell his story, continue to rail about the rising national debt and continue to preach fiscal restraint.
\
He may be trailing in the polls, but incumbents aren't unbeatable in the 1st District. Since redistricting after the 1960 census reduced Maine's contingent from three representatives to two, incumbents seeking re-election have won 16 out of 18 times, with former Portland Mayor Tom Allen's 1996 defeat of James Longley Jr. after one term joining Emery's 1974 upset.

""It was a long time ago, but it was a year not unlike this year,"" Emery said. ""You just have to work as hard as you can to put yourself in position to win. Against a well-funded incumbent, it's always an uphill battle.""

66,"Deep in the commercial forests of northern Maine, trees are often valued for their lumber potential or for the ecological benefits they provide. But now a small and growing number of businesses from as far away as California may be investing in Maine's woods as a way to address climate change.\Trees absorb carbon dioxide - and larger trees means more of the greenhouse gas is locked away. In an effort to head off global warming, California and two Canadian provinces are requiring some companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or purchase carbon ""offsets"" in order to comply with government limits.\The Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit forest landowner, hopes to connect those companies with the vast Maine woods in a way that could benefit both.\The conservancy has agreed to manage 124,000 acres along the St. John River between Maine and Quebec as essentially a ""carbon storage bank"" for the next century. The conservancy gets paid for allowing trees to grow longer - and taller - on their lands by companies that purchase carbon offsets. At the same time, older and better-managed trees should ultimately yield higher-quality lumber when the time comes to harvest them, according to Nature Conservancy staff.\Mark Berry, forest program director at The Nature Conservancy in Maine, said the project is a logical progression for land that the organization purchased back in 1998.\""I think we all view it as a very appropriate and exciting opportunity,"" Berry said. ""The St. John Forest has, for almost 20 years, been a place for the Conservancy to be innovative and think about new ways to blend conservation and the timber economy.""\VAST CARBON-STORING CAPACITY\Governments around the globe have toyed with all sorts of ideas for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases as scientists warn that humans are driving up atmospheric carbon dioxide to climate-altering levels. And while engineers are developing technologies to remove or ""scrub"" carbon dioxide from the air, trees are an all-natural and decidedly low-tech way to store carbon (at least temporarily).\Like all photosynthesizing organisms, trees absorb carbon dioxide from the environment and turn it into sugars, cellulose and the other components that allow a tree to grow. Some of that carbon ends up being stored, or sequestered, in the tree's woody structure until it decays or burns.\Maine's 17 million acres of forestland - covering 89 percent of the state, the highest in the nation - and the soils beneath them are storing an estimated 2.5 billion pounds of carbon dioxide, according to the U.S. Forest Service's most recent figures. The only northeastern state to rank above Maine in total forest carbon storage is New York, which has a land mass more than 50 percent larger than that of the Pine Tree State.\The idea behind carbon regulatory programs is that companies that emit greenhouse gases must either reduce emissions or pay to offset that greenhouse gas pollution elsewhere.\The Nature Conservancy and the handful of other Maine landowners that have put forested acreage into carbon offset programs are participating in the Western Climate Initiative regulatory program operated by California, Quebec and Ontario. In other words, businesses in California or Canada that purchase the carbon offsets - which vary in price, depending on timing and supply/demand dynamics - will pay The Nature Conservancy to lock up more carbon on the St. John Forest lands for the next century in order to meet their own regulatory requirements.\The conservancy is working with Climate Trust Capital, a U.S.-based private investment fund, to develop the forest carbon project. While the conservancy hasn't sold any offsets yet on its Maine lands, California companies that have purchased offsets in other U.S. forests include Chevron, Tesoro Refining & Marketing, Calpine Energy Services and Shell Energy North America.\The Nature Conservancy purchased the St. John Forest property - roughly 160,000 acres along the Maine-Quebec border west of the Allagash Wilderness Waterway - 20 years ago this winter. The purchase was among the first in a wave of conservation-oriented land deals in Maine's vast commercial timberlands as companies like Great Northern Paper and International Paper shed their land holdings.\The organization has always harvested timber on parts of the land, selling wood to local mills to help cover the costs of maintaining a road network and invest in conservation projects. And some harvesting will continue even with the carbon storage project. But Berry said recent uncertainty in Maine's timber markets spurred the organization to diversify revenue sources by expanding into maple sugaring last year and carbon offsets this summer.\""From a financial standpoint, it puts us on a much more solid footing for conserving the property, especially the ecological preserve"" not included in the carbon offset, Berry said.\OFFSET MARKET STILL NASCENT IN MAINE\Such carbon forest projects are not new, nor is the underlying concept of ""markets"" where companies can buy and sell pollution offsets or credits as a way to address greenhouse gas emissions. Maine has been a party to a similar program, known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, for more than a decade, and Australia as well as European governments have been trying to tackle climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions with such cap-and-trade initiatives for years.\In 2016, more than $660 million was spent on carbon offsets around the world, according to the ""State of Forest Carbon Finance 2017"" report by the nonprofit Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace. Those proceeds helped finance forest conservation, restoration or improvement projects on more than 29 million acres, much of it in the developing world.\The North American carbon market has yet to develop into the large, complex system that many supporters envisioned, however. The California-driven Western Climate Initiative is the only major regulatory scheme, although there are ""voluntary"" markets for businesses or consumers that want to offset the greenhouse gas emissions they created while flying in an airplane or during their daily commute.\After launching with significant hype - and some controversy - in 2007, the Western Climate Initiative is now down to just three participants with Ontario poised for withdrawal as well. That's compared to the seven states and four Canadian provinces involved in early discussions.\At 124,000 acres, the Nature Conservancy's St. John Forest property is the largest carbon storage project in Maine to date and brings the state lands enrolled in either the California or voluntary markets to roughly 270,000 acres.\Yet with more than 17 million acres of forestland - much of it meeting the sustainable forestry standards required of carbon offset programs - the carbon offset market has yet to take off in Maine.\Eric Wahlberg, director of climate services at the Massachusetts-based scientific nonprofit Manomet, said the California market is likely to grow over the long term. But he noted that landowners in New England and elsewhere selling carbon offsets into the marketplace tend to be conservation-oriented rather than for-profit timber companies.\""So far, it has been a situation where the for-profit folks are watching this closely, and a few folks have put some (acreage) into offsets, but we are not seeing a big shift in this direction yet,"" Wahlberg said. ""Most of the feedback I am hearing is there are a lot of concerns about limitations of (timber) management and a lot of concerns about the length of the agreements, some of which run for 100 years.""\A 2017 survey of seven larger landowners in Maine conducted by the organization Keeping Maine's Forests found similar dynamics. While the respondents - all of whom already meet the sustainable forestry standards required for offsets - said they had considered participating in the programs, none had taken that next step.\Landowners said low or fluctuating offset prices, restrictions on timber harvesting and the long-term nature of the agreements discouraged participation.\""For many landowners, the decision whether to enter the carbon credit market is strictly a matter of financial return and risk,"" reads the study.\HELPING CLIMATE, GENERATING REVENUE\Critics of carbon offset programs - particularly the voluntary market aimed at individuals and companies - have questioned whether they are truly lowering emissions or helping the environment.\Some critics point to surveys showing that individuals who purchased carbon offsets to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions for, say, airline travel may then feel justified in flying even more, thereby adding more climate-warming gases to the atmosphere. Others question if landowners vowing to store carbon as part of offsets sold in 2018 will still be living up to those obligations 30, 50 or even 100 years down the road.\Berry, however, has had firsthand experience with forest carbon offsets before joining The Nature Conservancy last year.\He headed Downeast Lakes Land Trust - a conservation group located in the Grand Lake Stream area of Washington County - when the organization became the nation's first ""improved forest management carbon project"" outside of California. The organization agreed to long-term carbon management practices on 19,118 acres and, several years later, worked with a landowner on a 100-year carbon stocks agreement on another 22,000 acres.\Berry said offset sales allowed Downeast Lakes Land Trust to purchase the 22,000 acres in Grand Lake Stream Plantation, permanently protecting it from development.\The Passamaquoddy Tribe of Washington County has also put more than 90,000 acres of its forestlands into carbon offset programs as well, generating millions of dollars for tribal programs. A handful of other organizations, such as the Appalachian Mountain Club, have also put land in Maine into carbon offsets.\Berry said while The Nature Conservancy's lands are a small portion of the offset program, he said the goals of California's cap-and-trade program - a 40 percent reduction from 1990 emissions levels by 2030 - are an important contribution to addressing climate change. Meanwhile, the revenues from offset sales in California will reverberate several thousand miles east in Maine.\""This project should generate revenues that will be helpful in all of our other forest conservation work in the future,"" Berry said.\Kevin Miller can be contacted at 791-6312 or at:\kmiller@mainetoday.com\Twitter: KevinMillerPPH "

68,"Shopping for power and electricity facts\Your story on shopping for power is accurate for the very near future but, within five years, there will be an entirely different, viable option available for electricity. That option will be fuel cells, electrochemical generators that convert hydrogen (from natural gas, propane, gasoline, kerosene, methanol, etc) into electricity, with no more emissions into our environment than heat and water (steam).\An appliance the size of a dishwasher can sit in your basement and produce all the electricity and hot water you need, independent of power lines. This is not a dream; beta units are powering homes in upstate New York today as well as in Canada, Germany, Japan etc.\Fuel cells are going to change everyone's concept of power. They will replace everything from batteries, to the internal combustion engine, to nuclear and coal-fired megaplants. Clean, abundant hydrogen is the fuel of the 21st century.\To find out what is going on, just enter ""fuel cell"" on Yahoo! and be prepared to spend some time following all the links that come up. Be prepared to be astounded at the possibilities!\Patrick Manley\Washington\YOUR EDITORIAL (Jan. 9) incorrectly stated that FPL Energy wants to use a system of trading emission credits rather than making significant improvements in emissions at the Wyman Plant.\We consider an investment of $10 million in new technology to help achieve approximately 80 percent of the proposed emission reductions to be very significant. As we have repeatedly stated, cap and trade would only be used to accomplish the last increment of pollution reduction.\Since last April, we have been making improvements at the plant to reduce air emissions. The proposed new rule, which we support with trading allowances, will be the next major step as we strive for continuous environmental improvement. We hope the Board of Environmental Protection will support our commitment to make a major investment in the plant while granting us the same flexibility afforded every other state in the Ozone Transport Region.\Greg Dettmer\Wyman Station Manager\FPL Energy\Yarmouth\THE TELEGRAM'S useful ""Electricity in Maine"" special report on Jan. 30 noted the pending rate cuts financed by utility power-plant sales. It then pointed to the possibility of further cuts by the end of the decade when customers will, in the reporter's words, ""be finished paying back utilities for most of their uneconomic investments in past power ventures."" This is misleading. More than 80 percent of the Central Maine Power ""stranded costs"" the state has declared eligible for rate recovery in the 12 months starting March 1 have nothing whatever to do with utility ""investments.""\They represent the above-market pricing of nonutility energy that federal law requires utilities to purchase, and that Maine's original rules in the early '80s required buying under long-term contracts without competitive bidding or price-adjustment clauses.\Nonutility generation also accounts for the majority of stranded costs expected to be recovered in future years, though the level is subject to recalculation as competitive energy-market prices rise or fall.\CMP's backlog of uncollected costs will be largely erased by 2008, which should permit additional reductions in energy-delivery prices, as your report notes. But that backlog largely reflects the costs of well-intentioned governmental mandates, not utility decisions.\Clark Irwin\Coordinator,\Financial Communications\Corporate Communications\Department\Central Maine Power Co.\Augusta\AGAIN, your editorial page is singing the praises of deregulation and a cut of ""about 10 percent"" to our electric bills (Jan. 30).\The present cost of my Central Maine Power residential power is 4.3 cents per kilowatt hour, and the transmission cost of that power is 7.7 cents per kwh for a total of 12 cents per kwh.

That's a 10 percent reduction and/or savings? Among others, the Maine Legislature, the writers and editors of our newspapers, the Public Utilities Commission and CMP have all suggested that deregulation will bring marvelous change to our cost of electricity.

69," Congress was set to approve the first change in fisheries regulations in a decade after the Senate passed compromise legislation Thursday by a voice vote.\ The House must still consider the bill, but approval is expected before the chamber adjourns today for the year.\ ""Whether we are talking about a 300-year-old fishing village in Down East Maine or remote fishing outposts in Alaska's Aleutian Islands, we must be bound by ... a thoughtful balance between sustaining both fish and fishermen,"" said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R- Maine, in a prepared statement.\ The legislation is important to Maine because commercial fishing employed 8,500 people in the state and provided $400 million worth of landings last year.\ Changes in the rules ripple through the economy. Between 1996 and 2005, for example, groundfish landings in the state declined by a quarter, and the number of active fishing boats fell by almost a third.\ The variety of interests, from fishermen to environmentalists, and differences among the eight fisheries management councils that establish rules for various regions made agreement on a national policy elusive.\ The law known as the Magnuson-Stevens Act governs how fish are managed in federal waters, within 200 miles of shore. It began in 1976 and was last updated in 1996. With more than 100 lawsuits pending against the National Marine Fisheries Service, lawmakers hoped to legislate new policy rather than have rules settled in court.\ The central question was how to limit the total catch for depleted fish. The compromise settled on limits that don't exceed the ""maximum sustainable yield.""\ Councils must ""establish a mechanism for specifying annual catch limits ... at a level such that overfishing does not occur in the fishery, including measures to ensure accountability,"" according to the bill.\ The House version would have set a total allowable catch limit, which critics argued would have been a dangerous loophole.\ A provision in the earlier Senate version would have allowed overfishing in one year to be counted against the following year's limit, but that element has been dropped.\ ""This historic legislation creates a cap-and-trade system that will provide an economic lifeline to fishermen and ensure a secure supply of fresh, local seafood for all Americans,"" said David Festa, a former policy director at the Commerce Department who is now oceans director for the advocacy group Environmental Defense.\ Another point of contention involved the experimental programs that regional councils could adopt to protect specific fisheries.\ For example, herring fishermen could adopt a cap on tons caught, then divide the total among the licensed fishermen.\ But concerns about individual fishing quotas or limited-access privilege programs include big companies buying out the licenses of family fishermen.\ The compromise settled on a two-thirds referendum of the entire fishery required to adopt any quota program in New England.\ ""Our fisheries law must also accommodate scientific uncertainty, recognize that fisheries ecosystems are highly complex and ensure that our management system can adapt to ever-changing marine environments,"" Snowe said. ""There is no one-size-fits-all solution to conserving the marine resources of our coastal communities.""\ Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, supported the compromise after changes such as eliminating a provision to allow overfishing in one year to count against the following year's catch limit.\ ""Inclusion of these amendments in the final bill assures that small operations, especially family-owned boats and fleets, will continue to have access to their fair share of the resource and won't be swept aside by the massive industrial fishing juggernauts,"" Allen said in a prepared statement. ""It also ensures that decisions about fisheries management policy will take local concerns fully into account and provide for local voices to be heard in the management decision-making process.""\ Other provisions:\ Allow international processing for fisheries that have traditionally been handled overseas, such as Maine herring fishermen enjoy with Canadian processors.\ Deduct the steaming time for boats to get to fishing grounds from the clock counting a license's days at sea.\ Clarify rules for experimenting with new catch methods or equipment.\ Study the impact of regulations on fishing communities.\ Authorize $338 million this year, ramping up to $397 million in 2013, for science and technology to study fisheries.\ Washington D.C.

AUGUSTA - Environmentalists, attorneys and business owners - about 100 in total - attended a hearing on a bill aimed at reducing pollution and greenhouse gases, which was heard by the Legislature's Natural Resources and Utilities and Energy committees Tuesday.
\
Under the bill, advanced by Gov. John Baldacci, Maine would join nine other Eastern states to help reduce greenhouse gases using a European-style cap-and-trade system to cut carbon dioxide emissions.
\
The proposal seeks to limit pollution from large power plants and create financial incentives for energy producers to cut emissions.
\
Generators that burn fossil fuels would pay for the right to release heat-trapping carbon dioxide. The money they pay the state would then be given out in grants to promote energy efficiency and conservation.
\
The bill's proponents said it was unusual that environmental leaders and commercial leaders could come to agreement on the bipartisan effort.
\
""It will prepare Maine for participation in a likely national program within the decade,"" testified Ted Koffman, D-Bar Harbor and lead sponsor of the bill. ""In the process of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, we will reduce other pollutants that impact health and the environment, and we will become less reliant on imported fuel.""
\
Global warming has had a negative effect on the winter sports industries. Bill Brown of Sunday River and Sugarloaf ski resorts testified on behalf of the bill as well, although the bill could increase electrical costs.
\
""We are dependent on a healthy environment for the long-term viability of the ski industry and support legislation that has the goal of reducing global warming,"" Brown testified.
\
David Allen of Central Maine Power testified in opposition to parts of the bill, although the company is supportive of the overall goals, he said.
\
""There is no doubt that the cost of the carbon credits will be passed on to customers,"" Allen said. ""Not only will the direct costs to these particular plants get passed on, but, because of how the New England bid stack works, if these plants get their costs covered, every single other plant selling energy at that time, including hydropower and wind plants - will also receive a price that reflects the cost of these carbon credits.""
\
There were several other opponents with similar testimonies.
\
Bill Cohen of Verso Paper, based in Jay and Bucksport, was one of many who showed up representing Maine industry.
\
""Our reasons are much more than the fact that two of the six power plants included in this legislation are ours. Our two mills have combined cycle collocated gas generation plants. This means our two mills have, what some have described, as the two more efficient facilities in the United States.""
\
He later added that the legislation ""supports manufacturing and at the same time encourages power plants that are among the most efficient and environmentally friendly known today.""
\
The Natural Resources Council of Maine was one of the environmentalist organizations supporting the bill. Dylan Voorhees, energy director, said passing the measure is one of the most important steps in combating global warming.
\
""(Federal) government regulations are coming ... therefore better to prepare now,"" Voorhees told the committees. ""If Maine joins this trend today, instead of being forced to by the federal government in four to five years, we will be positioning ourselves to compete in the new, emerging global economy.""

The Brits are upset that President Barack Obama has been referring to disgraced oil giant BP as ""British Petroleum,"" a name it shed long ago.
\
But what else should Obama call an enormous Britain-based petroleum company? To ask such an innocent question betrays ignorance of the ways of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research. The marketing gurus at the firm ? led by uber Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg ? helped conceive and execute one of the most perverse rebrandings of all time for BP.
\
British? So yesterday. Petroleum? Not very green. A logo of a shield emblazoned with ""BP""? Disturbingly martial. In 2000, newly christened BP ditched all these negative associations by adopting the slogan ""beyond petroleum"" and emblazoning itself with a sunflowerlike logo that could be mistaken for the symbol of the Green Party of Canada.
\
It worked so brilliantly a Theodore White of marketing should write a blow-by-blow account, ""The Selling of BP."" Greenberg Quinlan Rosner bragged that its work for BP ""included extensive testing of advertising and evaluating the global response toward pioneering positions on the environment, climate change, and energy efficiency."" The case study outlining this extraordinary marketing success has since been removed from the firm's website. (Greenberg et al. are image-conscious people, after all.)
\
BP knew how to play the game. It repeated all the environmentally correct platitudes that tickle the fancy of ""NGO leaders, journalists, political elites,"" in the words of the case study. It supported the fashionable reform of the day, cap-and-trade, knowing that the system would favor the big and connected, like itself. And it showered campaign contributions on the candidate of Hope and Change (its employees gave Obama about twice as much in donations as they did John McCain in 2008).
\
BP couldn't have been notionally greener if Al Gore were its CEO. The group chief executive of BP, Lord John Browne, warned of the dangers of hydrocarbons, a little like the city fathers of Newcastle in the 19th century inveighing against coal. In a speech at Stanford in 2007, Browne advocated an ""international climate agency"" that would entail ""a move beyond the limitations of national sovereignty.""
\
This green one-worldism was awfully rich coming from an executive of an oil company that couldn't even drill responsibly. Despite all the hokum, BP spent vastly more resources on fossil fuels than green energy. In so doing, it compiled an atrocious safety record that made the poor decision-making that led to the blowout in the Gulf unsurprising to industry insiders.
\
And now tens of thousands of barrels of petroleum a day are fouling the Gulf, courtesy of the corporation that spent so much convincing people it was ""beyond"" it.
\
Rep. Joe Barton's quickly retracted apology to BP for the administration's strong-arm tactics was horribly misconceived. Fundamentally, we don't want a free market and a system of laws to protect corporations, but to protect us from both government and corporations, especially in league with one another. Corporations such as BP tend to be craven, unprincipled and willing to use government for their own ends ? all qualities evident in its spectacular green marketing campaign.
\
The bigger and more complex government is, the more incentive corporations have to politicize themselves and get in bed with Washington. If they have resources to do it (not everyone can afford Stan Greenberg), they'll protect themselves from the worst while disadvantaging their competitors. This accounts for the corporatist paradox of the Obama administration. The president is so arbitrarily anti-business that The Economist dubs him ""Vladimir Obama,"" yet the same industries he demonizes support key elements of his ""reform"" agenda.
\
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel argues that Barton's apology to BP is the sum total of Republican thought on the economy, and that the fall election is a choice between Obama-style hyperactive government, or the depredations of the execrable BP. To which the only rational answer can be, ""None of the above.""

\
WASHINGTON -- Two senators on Friday offered yet another approach to tackling climate change, proposing the government sell pollution allowances to industry to cut greenhouse gas emissions and then use most of the money to send tax-free monthly checks to every American.
\
The ""dividend"" checks, estimated to average about $100 a month over nearly two decades, would be aimed at offsetting the higher cost of energy.
\
The proposal by Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, was being offered as an alternative to a more complex cap-and-trade climate bill already before the Senate and approved by the House. Senators who believe Congress must address the problem of climate change are trying to cobble together a bill that has broad enough bipartisan support to get the 60 votes needed for it to pass, possibly early next year.
\
Cantwell said her approach is a simpler way to reduce carbon pollution and boost clean energy alternatives. Like the rival Senate bill, it would impose limits on greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels and is designed to cut emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and about 80 percent by mid-century.
\
Republicans have opposed the climate legislation, authored by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., that emerged in November from Boxer's Environment and Public Works Committee. Many centrist Democrats also have said the bill, similar to one approved by the House last summer, needs to be overhauled.
\
Kerry, joined by Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., this week unveiled the general outlines of changes they hoped to develop early next year to gather broader support for climate legislation.
\
The bill introduced by Cantwell and Collins adds yet another alternative, raising more uncertainty as to of what kind of climate legislation is likely to emerge when the Senate focuses on the issue early next year. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has said he hopes a bill could be taken up by the full Senate in early spring.
\
Cantwell and Collins largely abandon the broad cap and trade approach that has been the focus in the Senate up until now, and which has been widely attacked by Republicans and some centrist Democrats as too complex, subject to manipulation and tantamount to imposing a huge energy tax and threatening jobs.
\
While the Cantwell-Collins bill would still limit greenhouse gas emissions, it would also allow limited trading of emissions allowances. The government would auction ""carbon shares"" -- or allowances -- to fossil energy producers and importers. Three-fourths of the revenue collected would be returned directly to consumers in the form of monthly checks and the rest would be used to spur clean energy and energy efficiency development and help in the transition to ""green"" jobs.
\
Allowances could be traded among the energy producers and importers that are subject to the cap, but not other traders or speculators.
\
""This bill provides a simple approach to getting off of carbon and on to clean energy alternatives,"" Cantwell said in a statement. She said the bill would provide businesses and investors ""a simple predictable mechanism"" to reduce carbon dioxide pollution and ""open the way to clean energy expansion.""
\
Collins said she's for climate legislation only if it protects consumers and industries hit by higher energy prices, provides predictability so that businesses can plan and invest and encourages energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. The bill ""achieves all of these goals."" said Collins in a statement.

75,"PORTLAND, Maine -- An environmental group brought together Maine businesses to urge Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins to support a rule limiting power plant emissions, an issue that touches on a rift with her party.\The Natural Resources Council of Maine has been enlisting supporters in the state for weeks and on Friday delivered a memorandum to Collins' office with 400 signatures, asking the senator -- who is in the middle of a re-election campaign -- to declare support for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power plan before she returns to Washington on Monday.\Kevin Kelley, a spokesman for Collins, wrote in an email the senator is still reviewing the EPA's plan, which calls for reducing carbon emissions from existing fossil fuel power plants by 30 percent from 2005 by 2030.\""Maine sits at the end of the air-pollution tailpipe and thus is harmed by carbon pollution produced in other states,"" Kelley wrote. ""Sen. Collins has always supported reducing harmful emissions from coal-fired power plants, which threaten public health and the environment.""\Collins was the only Republican senator to vote against legislation that would impose specific restrictions on the EPA's ability to regulate carbon emissions, essentially hamstringing the agency's ability to enact tougher standards. However, she's the only member of the Maine delegation not to declare support for the EPA's proposal introduced in June, according to NRCM.\""We're asking her to continue the courage she showed then,"" Dan Amory, president of Maine Conservation Voters, said.\Dylan Voorhees, the clean energy director for NRCM, said he hoped Collins would announce her position on the EPA rules before next week's return to Congress, where the lobbyists for power plants affected by the proposal are more abundant and active.\Voorhees echoed Kelley's statement that Maine bears the brunt of air pollution from coal-fired plants in other parts of the country and the region should generally support the limits. On top of that, EPA leaders have cited New England's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions, as a model.\The plan as proposed would affect only four Maine power plants, which would need to reduce emissions by a collective 13.5 percent. Coal is not used at any of the affected Maine plants, which are Wyman Generating Station on Cousins Island in Yarmouth, Maine Independence Station in Veazie, Rumford Power in Rumford and Westbrook Energy Center in Westbrook, according to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.\Ted Reiner, a former lobster fisherman from Cliff Island, said tougher national power plant emissions standards are an important effort to battling climate change, which has economic consequences for Maine's nearly $400 million-a-year lobster industry and other fisheries.\The Gulf of Maine has been particularly affected by climate change. The Associated Press reported this week that the waters off Maine's coast are warming faster than 99 percent of the world's oceans, which has an impact on fisheries and the rest of Maine's natural environment, a draw for tourists to the state.\Taryn Hallweaver, a campaign director with Environment Maine, said the proposed power plant emission reductions from the EPA would have the same effect as taking about two-thirds of the country's gasoline-powered cars off the road.\While the group that included wind industry supporters met outside Collins' Portland office, the senator was in Castine, visiting the University of Maine's floating offshore wind turbine project.\Paul Williamson, head of the Maine Ocean and Wind Industry Initiative, said the EPA's plan would be a boon for the industry.\""The plan supports projects like VolturnUS and other activities like that in Maine,"" Williamson said.\The group reiterated expected health impacts of the EPA rules as well.\The EPA estimates the plan will lead to $90 billion in health benefits -- preventing up to 150,000 asthma attacks in children and 6,600 premature deaths -- based on expected improvements in air quality.\While the plan will be considered by Congress before November, Collins' stance on environmental issues has become a point of contention in her re-election bid, facing Democratic challenger Shenna Bellows, who has stated support for the proposed EPA rules.\Credit: Darren Fishell BDN Staff"
76,"
The solar industry is growing fast, partly because costs of installation are falling across the nation with each new investment.
\
Another home or business goes solar in the United States every 2.5 minutes. Since 2010 alone, prices have fallen by 46 percent.
\
That rapid growth is being felt here in Maine, where 3.5 megawatts of solar capacity were installed in Maine in 2014, a 43 percent increase over a single year.
\
Even sunnier news: Solar energy is poised to play a major role in Maine's transition to a cleaner future. That's exactly why we need the Clean Power Plan, which was released last month by the Environmental Protection Agency.
\
The plan is the biggest step on climate change the country has ever taken. These new standards will cut carbon pollution from dirty coal, gas and oil power plants by 30 percent by the year 2030. The plan allows flexibility for states to cut emissions how they choose, but rewards states that choose to invest in renewables.
\
""Solar works in all 50 states, has zero carbon emissions, creates more jobs per megawatt than any other technology and can be deployed cost-effectively and quickly -- all while improving grid reliability,"" said Rhone Resch, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a national trade group, after release of the Clean Power Plan.
\
The Clean Power Plan builds on the momentum that Maine's businesses, communities and individuals already have built through their investments in solar.
\
On Earth Day this past April, the sun shone on Maine's first community solar farm in South Paris. Community solar farms offer more Mainers the opportunity to get in on the solar boom while saving on their electricity bills. Community solar farms reach the 85 percent of customers who aren't able to invest in solar because their properties are unsuitable. On Aug. 12, another community solar farm opened in Edgecomb.
\
As we rely less and less on polluting coal and gas plants, Mainers have the opportunity to become energy independent through investing in solar. The No. 1 obstacle is the will of decision-makers.
\
Behind California, Massachusetts employs the second-most workers in the solar industry. Maine is ranked 43rd, with just more than 400 jobs at 43 companies. The reason for the discrepancy between Maine and Massachusetts lies with the fact that Maine is the only state in New England without a solar development policy.
\
At the same time, federal tax credits for solar investments are scheduled to expire by the end of 2016. Potential projects would be left in flux as costs will rise if the credits are allowed to expire.
\
That's why Maine Solar Solutions has joined more than 670 installers, manufacturers and others in the industry -- including 12 businesses from Maine -- on a letter last month to the White House, endorsing the Clean Power Plan and calling for solar energy to play a strong role in its rollout.
\
The Clean Power Plan, which includes solar incentives, is a huge step forward. Its Clean Energy Incentive Program will reward states that choose to cut their emissions by investing in solar.
\
Furthermore, credits will be awarded to projects that generate renewable energy in 2020 and 2021, and begin construction after a state submits their implementation plan. These incentives will drive quicker investment in solar, with the goal of making clean energy affordable for all Mainers.
\
Maine has proven that it's up to the challenge to create a cleaner energy future. Since joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in 2009, the regional cap-and-trade program has cut Maine's emissions while saving Mainers on their electricity bills. According to ""States of Progress,"" a recent report by the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group, Maine is on track to surpass its 2030 pollution reduction targets because of its participation in RGGI.
\
Maine's government can and should do more to support one of the state's most promising industries, for the future of our economy and environment. We can't afford to let tax credits expire in 2016. We can't afford the Gulf of Maine's rapid warming.
\
Simply put: Maine can't continue business as usual. The Clean Power Plan is the beginning of a more sustainable economic and environmental future.
\
As big polluters and their allies ramp up their opposition in Congress to the Clean Power Plan, it's vital that Mainers stand for a clean energy future. We hope that Sen. Susan Collins -- a key vote in the Senate -- will stand with Mainers for the sake of our environment, sustainable industries and future generations.

Without changing our habits, climate change will continue, and the federal measures such as flood insurance or emergency management will continue to inadequate and overwhelmed.\Yet if we put a price on carbon, our habits will change. Decades of gas taxes, and cap-and-trade policies have attempted to do this, but they have failed in critical ways. The gas tax hurt the consumer, who often never saw the revenue spent in his or her local district. The cap and trade policies demanded that large-scale polluters pay, but ignored the many other sources of carbon dioxide.\Now the fee and dividend approach could correct the inadequacies of these earlier policies. Energy giants would pay a fee at the point of extraction, and that fee would be distributed to citizens as a dividend. Yes, the price of fuel would increase, but consumers would be armed with the revenue needed to meet that challenge.\It will not be an easy transition away from fossil fuels, but we must begin now if we hope to save other coastal Maine businesses from flooding and erosion.\Sue Griffith\Parkman\"
78,"UNITY, Maine -- Two Maine scientists are celebrating good news about the environment, after a decades-long study has shown that the negative effects of acid rain have been reversed much faster than expected.\Steve Kahl, a sustainability professor at Unity College, said Thursday that the study looked at lakes throughout most of New England and New York, and it found that environmental regulations and the voluntary actions of industry have sharply reduced sulfur emissions in rain and snow. It also found that soils are recovering quickly, without taking centuries to bounce back that some had predicted would be necessary. Finally, the scientists learned that some of the acidity in the watersheds is organic, occurring naturally, and should not be targeted by the Clean Air Act policy.\""Success stories are possible,"" Kahl said, adding that the reduction of emissions since the 1970s and 1980s has been critical for water quality. ""This is a huge success story for the environment.""\The study was published this spring on the website for the journal Environmental Science & Technology.\Acid rain was an environmental hot button issue in the 1980s. It occurs when factories and coal-burning power plants emit sulfur dioxide and other acidic chemicals that mix in the atmosphere and produce acid rain. Because of the prevailing winds, pollution that was generated in the midwest would blow east and damage lakes, forests and streams in Maine and other parts of the Northeast, killing fish and alarming residents.\At that time, photos of dying trees were shown by environmentalists to generate support for regulatory measures aimed at reducing chemical emissions.\According to Kahl, sulfur emissions in rain and snow have dropped by about 70 percent from the peak in the 1980s. He said that industry was able to save money by switching to lower-emissions fuels, and the formerly-controversial cap-and-trade practice that was established by the federal government has proved to be a success. That practice allows companies flexibility in complying with a mandatory cap on emissions, and it has helped reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from 17.3 million tons in 1980 to about 7.6 million tons in 2008, according to the EPA.\""It's not controversial anymore,"" Kahl said. ""It just works. It should be a model for environmental issues. It provides a flexible way to reach the same target and use whatever methods to get there.""\The professor has been studying Maine lakes since 1983, when he was selected to be the team leader for the EPA's regional acid rain assessment. Although he stopped running the study in 2010, he remains involved, along with Sarah Nelson, an associate research professor at the University of Maine's Mitchell Center and School of Forest Resources.\Nelson said that the study really shows the value of long-term monitoring.\""Because these lakes have been sampled for so long, they're really sentinels of what's been going on in the Northeast,"" she said. ""It's really an amazing resource.""\Kahl, Nelson, and another scientist from the University of New Hampshire, take samples at least once a year from 74 lakes in Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New York. The lakes were chosen to represent the Northeast, with some located in busy suburbs of Boston and some on remote Maine mountaintops. She said that the sampling at Maine's high-elevation lakes takes place in the fall, usually by helicopter.\""You hop out on the pontoon, dump a bottle in the water and take off,"" she said.\Those high-elevation lakes serve as the canary in the coal mine for water quality, Nelson said. Because they are essentially granite bowls without much soil around them, acidic precipitation can be measured more easily.\Although scientists continue to learn about new issues in the environment, including climate change and major weather events, the acid rain study shows that change is possible, Nelson said.\""I think sometimes there can be a perception of doom and gloom, and there are lots of problems, and it's hard to figure out how to solve them,"" she said.

79,"Environmental groups and members of the business community are trying to put political pressure on Maine Sen. Susan Collins to support the Obama administration's proposal to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.\Environmental groups and some members of the business community are trying to put political pressure on U.S. Sen. Susan Collins to publicly support the Obama administration's proposal to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. \About a dozen people gathered Friday morning in Lobsterman's Park near Collins' Portland office to urge the Maine Republican to back plans by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 30 percent by 2030. The EPA is still gathering public comment on the proposal, but the issue is likely to spark debate in Congress from both backers and detractors in the run-up to the November elections. \""As she goes back to Washington, we want her to know that Maine people and businesses support action on climate (change), that we have her back and we urge her to stand up and support the EPA's clean power plan,"" said Dylan Voorhees of the Natural Resources Council of Maine. \Those present at the news conference - including a former lobsterman and a representative of the wind energy industry - then went to Collins' office to present a letter signed by more than 400 Maine business owners urging support for the EPA rules. The letter was also addressed to Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who has expressed support for the regulations. \Collins is the only member of Maine's four-member congressional delegation who has not explicitly backed the EPA rules, although she has defended the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gases. Her spokesman, Kevin Kelly, said Friday that Collins ""has always supported reducing harmful emissions from coal-fired power plants, which threaten public health and the environment,"" but that climate change requires reducing greenhouse gas pollution worldwide. \""She is carefully reviewing EPA's wide-ranging and complex proposal to reduce carbon emissions from existing fossil-fueled power plants,"" Kelly said in a statement. ""The public comment process will provide states, stakeholders, and the public with the opportunity to evaluate and comment on the new proposal, including its impact on public health, the affordability of electricity rates, and the effect on the economy."" \The EPA proposal on carbon dioxide is the Obama administration's most aggressive initiative to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases linked to climate change. Each state was assigned a different reduction target based on a host of factors, including the state's reliance on coal-burning power plants, which are among the largest emitters of carbon dioxide, as well as mercury and other pollutants. \NORTHEAST WELL-POSITIONED \Maine would be expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 13.5 percent by 2030. Although the details have yet to be worked out, Maine and eight other Northeastern states appear well-positioned to comply with the federal rules because fossil fuel-burning power plants in the region have been operating for five years under a cap-and-trade program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. \The EPA proposal is highly controversial elsewhere, however. Political and business leaders in coal-mining or coal-dependent states are working overtime to squelch the proposed rules, which they predict will drive up electricity costs and cause massive job losses in the mining sector. \Collins, a moderate Republican, has bucked her party on at least two occasions by voting against proposals to block the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. And she is regarded by some national environmental groups as one of the friendlier Senate Republicans on key issues, even picking up an endorsement from the League of Conservation Voters Action Fund. \Her opponent in the November election, Democrat Shenna Bellows, has suggested that Collins' unclear stance on the EPA rules is part of a broader trend of the Republican hedging on major issues. She has called on Collins to publicly distance herself from an effort by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to scuttle the EPA proposal. \The proposed regulations on carbon dioxide emissions are EPA rules, not legislation.

80,"
The solar industry is growing fast, partly because costs of installation are falling across the nation with each new investment.
\
Another home or business goes solar in the United States every 2.5 minutes. Since 2010 alone, prices have fallen by 46 percent.
\
That rapid growth is being felt here in Maine, where 3.5 megawatts of solar capacity were installed in Maine in 2014, a 43 percent increase over a single year.
\
Even sunnier news: Solar energy is poised to play a major role in Maine's transition to a cleaner future. That's exactly why we need the Clean Power Plan, which was released last month by the Environmental Protection Agency.
\
The plan is the biggest step on climate change the country has ever taken. These new standards will cut carbon pollution from dirty coal, gas and oil power plants by 30 percent by the year 2030. The plan allows flexibility for states to cut emissions how they choose, but rewards states that choose to invest in renewables.
\
""Solar works in all 50 states, has zero carbon emissions, creates more jobs per megawatt than any other technology and can be deployed cost-effectively and quickly -- all while improving grid reliability,"" said Rhone Resch, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a national trade group, after release of the Clean Power Plan.
\
The Clean Power Plan builds on the momentum that Maine's businesses, communities and individuals already have built through their investments in solar.
\
On Earth Day this past April, the sun shone on Maine's first community solar farm in South Paris. Community solar farms offer more Mainers the opportunity to get in on the solar boom while saving on their electricity bills. Community solar farms reach the 85 percent of customers who aren't able to invest in solar because their properties are unsuitable. On Aug. 12, another community solar farm opened in Edgecomb.
\
As we rely less and less on polluting coal and gas plants, Mainers have the opportunity to become energy independent through investing in solar. The No. 1 obstacle is the will of decision-makers.
\
Behind California, Massachusetts employs the second-most workers in the solar industry. Maine is ranked 43rd, with just more than 400 jobs at 43 companies. The reason for the discrepancy between Maine and Massachusetts lies with the fact that Maine is the only state in New England without a solar development policy.
\
At the same time, federal tax credits for solar investments are scheduled to expire by the end of 2016. Potential projects would be left in flux as costs will rise if the credits are allowed to expire.
\
That's why Maine Solar Solutions has joined more than 670 installers, manufacturers and others in the industry -- including 12 businesses from Maine -- on a letter last month to the White House, endorsing the Clean Power Plan and calling for solar energy to play a strong role in its rollout.
\
The Clean Power Plan, which includes solar incentives, is a huge step forward. Its Clean Energy Incentive Program will reward states that choose to cut their emissions by investing in solar.
\
Furthermore, credits will be awarded to projects that generate renewable energy in 2020 and 2021, and begin construction after a state submits their implementation plan. These incentives will drive quicker investment in solar, with the goal of making clean energy affordable for all Mainers.
\
Maine has proven that it's up to the challenge to create a cleaner energy future. Since joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in 2009, the regional cap-and-trade program has cut Maine's emissions while saving Mainers on their electricity bills. According to ""States of Progress,"" a recent report by the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group, Maine is on track to surpass its 2030 pollution reduction targets because of its participation in RGGI.
\
Maine's government can and should do more to support one of the state's most promising industries, for the future of our economy and environment. We can't afford to let tax credits expire in 2016. We can't afford the Gulf of Maine's rapid warming.
\
Simply put: Maine can't continue business as usual. The Clean Power Plan is the beginning of a more sustainable economic and environmental future.
\
As big polluters and their allies ramp up their opposition in Congress to the Clean Power Plan, it's vital that Mainers stand for a clean energy future. We hope that Sen. Susan Collins -- a key vote in the Senate -- will stand with Mainers for the sake of our environment, sustainable industries and future generations.

81," Dr. Lani Graham recalled Monday that she was ""both shocked and frightened"" when she learned more than a decade ago how much mercury had been accumulating in Acadia National Park. Graham, who was Maine's chief health officer at the time, had been notified by a park official that fish in one of Acadia's lakes contained mercury at levels ""many times what would be considered safe for a child to consume on a frequent basis."" She soon discovered the contamination was by no means unique, leading to statewide warnings about eating fish from Maine waters.\ Graham, now a family physician who is active in public health issues, recounted her experience during a field hearing on a new mercury pollution rule proposed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. She told U.S. Rep. Tom Allen, a Portland Democrat who hosted the event, that she was testifying ""on behalf of the people of Maine, and particularly the children of Maine, who cannot speak for themselves.\ ""It is very sad that in these times, when childhood obesity is such a problem . . . that any health official must issue warnings on the consumption of fish, widely respected as a healthy food, because it has become contaminated by our carelessness,"" she said.\ Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that is considered a health risk to children and women of childbearing age. The Clinton administration labeled it a hazardous air pollutant that had to be regulated with the ""maximum achievable control technology."" Under that standard, coal-fired power plants would have to reduce their mercury emissions by as much as 90 percent by the end of 2007.\ Now, the EPA is considering a rule that would delay the first compliance deadline, requiring a 29 percent reduction by 2010 and a 69 percent reduction by 2018. It would also allow a ""cap and trade"" program that would let power plants buy and sell pollution credits.\ Allen called the proposal ""embarrassing."" He said that in February a new EPA analysis found that 630,000 children are born in the United States with blood mercury levels higher than 5.8 parts per million.\ ""That's the level at which the risk of poor brain development is doubled,"" Allen said.\ When the EPA declined to schedule a public hearing on the new mercury rule in New England - the closest hearing was in Philadelphia last week - Allen scheduled one of his own in Augusta and said he would turn over any testimony to the federal agency.\ Marjorie Monteleon drove more than five hours round trip from her home in Southwest Harbor to let Allen know how she feels.\ ""What really gripes me is the EPA's motto is `Protecting human health, safeguarding the natural environment,' "" she said. ""I wonder when they're going to do that? It appears it is only lawsuits that seem to wake them up.""\ Dr. James Maier, a child and family psychotherapist from Scarborough, said mercury pollution is not just an academic issue for him because he's spent most of his professional life caring for ""damaged kids"" who ""have been handicapped in school and life with various emotional and behavioral problems.\ ""Delaying the implementation of the existing technology means that countless more tons of mercury are going to be dumped on Maine, and how many IQ points does that subtract from Maine children?"" he said. ""That's an experiment I don't want my grandchild or other children to be a part of.""\ Susan Gallo, a biologist at Maine Audubon, focused on wildlife issues, noting that Maine loons have higher levels of mercury in their blood, feathers and eggs than loons in any other state.\ Although she has long dealt with the mercury issue professionally, Gallo said the subject is ""even more meaningful"" to her now because she is pregnant.\ ""I keep hearing that one in six women of childbearing age are at risk of high levels of mercury, and I wonder if I'm one of them,"" she said.\ Industry groups say the EPA proposal would provide them with more flexibility. A cap-and-trade program ""could cost the industry and the ratepayers significantly less money over time,"" said Dan Riedinger, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute.\ Riedinger, who did not attend the field hearing, said mercury emissions from U.S. utilities represent just 1 percent of the global pool of mercury, so even large reductions are not likely to make states' fish consumption advisories go away.\ ""About 50 percent of all mercury emissions globally come from Asia alone, so unless there is a crackdown not just in the U.S. but elsewhere, it is unlikely that we will in the U.S. benefit from any appreciable improvement in the public exposure to mercury,"" he said. ""Even a 50 percent reduction in U.S. utility emissions would on average reduce an individual's exposure in the U.S. by less than 1 percent.""\ Staff Writer Meredith Goad can be contacted at 791-6332 or at:\ mgoad@pressherald.com"
82," Methods for dealing with climate change continue to percolate in Congress after a flurry of hearings and bill introductions, as well as the kindling of a Supreme Court decision earlier this month. But the subject remains hazy with options and resistance from critics of urgent action.\ Concerns across Maine range from coastal flooding to changing animal habitat to confused maple trees. Reports emerge daily about the nature of the threat.\ The Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, has discovered one obscure ramification. Federal insurance programs for flooding and crops have failed to anticipate billions of dollars in liability looming from worsening weather.\ But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warned Wednesday that capping carbon dioxide emissions would cost consumers ""persistently higher prices for products such as electricity and gasoline.""\ The strategy could force businesses to become more efficient, like a tax on burning coal or oil. It could cost jobs, however, particularly in the coal industry, which generates half the country's electricity.\ CAP-AND-TRADE BILLS PROPOSED\ Lawmakers are grappling with how far to go. A variety of bills are jockeying to regulate six heat-trapping greenhouse gases. The emissions come roughly 40 percent from power plants, 30 percent from transportation and 30 percent from other industry.\ Strategies for reducing the emissions tend to follow two paths.\ One is to cap emissions and then reward companies that reduce emissions the most by allowing them to trade credits to others who can't cut as much.\ The market for these credits could run to hundreds of billions of dollars per year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. This cost threatens to bring about higher prices or job losses by discouraging industries such as coal mining.\ Another tactic is to pursue renewable energy, such as wind power, that doesn't burn coal to create the emissions.\ Of the four major bills that the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reviewed in the Senate, Maine Republican Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins joined the cap-and-trade bill sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn. Snowe also joined Massachusetts Democratic Sen. John Kerry's bill, which has similar goals.\ In the House, the two major measures mirror the Lieberman and Kerry bills. Democratic Reps. Tom Allen and Mike Michaud each signed on to both versions.\ Lieberman's legislation would cap emissions in 2012 at the levels of emissions from 2004, or 6.1 billion metric tons. Then he would ratchet down emissions to 5.2 billion in 2020, 4.1 billion the following decade and 2.1 billion by 2050.\ Kerry would cap emissions in 2010. By 2020, emissions would have to be reduced 2.5 percent each year until 2031. Then emissions would have to be reduced 3.5 percent each year to 2050.\ RULING GALVANIZES LAWMAKERS\ A rival proposal by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is even stricter. He would cap emissions in 2010 with reductions of 2 percent a year for the next decade.\ By 2020, companies would have to reduce emissions to 1990 levels. Then by 2050 they would have to reduce emissions to one-fifth of 1990 levels.\ While ambitious, Sanders' approach lacks the bipartisan support of the others, with only Democratic sponsors.\ Sparking interest in the subject was a landmark Supreme Court decision April 2 that the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases. Advocates had urged the EPA to regulate emissions from vehicles, but the agency had refused.\ ""This is likely to increase pressure on Congress to act quickly on global warming,"" said Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust.\ ""Key industries - particularly utilities and automakers - now face the prospect that the next president can impose his or her own global-warming emissions reduction program under the Clean Air Act if Congress doesn't write a new law,"" he said.\ Democratic California Sen. Barbara Boxer, head of the Environment Committee, urged EPA officials at a hearing Tuesday to allow states to regulate vehicle emissions under ""a fast timetable and no stalling.""\ But the committee's top Republican, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who has called global warming a hoax, criticized the high court's decision as unwise judicial activism.\ ""Attempts to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions will bring with them as-yet unimagined hardships to America's poor, elderly and the working class,"" Inhofe said.\ A PIECEMEAL APPROACH\ Another problem, of course, is that even if the United States reduces its emissions, other countries might not go along.\ The risk in tackling emissions across the entire economy is that the companies that create the most emissions might simply move elsewhere. For example, a cement-maker that produces a high level of emissions could simply move to another country and then add transportation - the cost and extra emissions - to the price of its product.\ Besides the loss of jobs, the emissions would still pose the same threat to the atmosphere.\ Rather than tackling the entire economy, legislation could also attack pieces of the problem.\ That is what's enticing about regulating power plants, which need to be local, and vehicle mileage, which has to be met no matter where the cars are built.\ Sen. Thomas Carper, D-Del., proposed a bill that Collins supports. It targets power plants to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide along with other pollutants, such as nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury.\ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., proposed to increase mileage requirements for vehicles, which would reduce emissions. But increasing mileage, which the entire Maine delegation supports, has proven impossible to pass in recent years.\ Lawmakers will spend the rest of the year debating which - if any - of these strategies to embrace or allow to evaporate.\ Washington D.C.

84,"State agencies and nonprofit groups are gearing up to weatherize hundreds of Maine homes this winter, thanks to more than $6 million in new state funding and increased federal aid.\The efforts all target the homes of low-income Mainers who are seeking help paying for heat this winter. By improving the efficiency of Maine's aging homes, the programs are intended to reduce the need to buy expensive oil this winter, as well as in future years.\While much of the money has been allocated, the work has yet to begin in earnest. State and local groups are now training energy auditors and weatherization contractors to handle the projects.\""The infrastructure basically disappeared in the '80s and '90s when oil was cheap,"" said Roger Bondeson, vice president of housing and energy services for the People's Regional Opportunity Program, a Portland-based aid provider. ""That's a little frustrating in one respect, but it's also exciting. A lot of people have been advocating for the growth of these programs for a long time. ... My hope is this kind of investment will be sustained.""\Weatherization - which includes insulating attics and walls and sealing leaks - is considered one of the more cost-effective ways Mainers can save money and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\""Unfortunately, we have one of the oldest housing stocks in the nation, and in addition to that, we have the highest per capita number of people who heat with oil,"" said John Kerry, director of the Governor's Office of Energy Independence.\Until now, energy conservation efforts, as well as global warming policies, have focused resources almost exclusively on electricity usage.\""When you look at the state of Maine, where 80 percent of the homes heat with oil, there is very little to address those who heat with fossil fuels,"" Kerry said.\Volatility in the oil market has changed that. Maine's Legislature, for example, passed a law calling for energy-efficiency standards in new home construction.\And money is flowing into programs that will help the state's neediest residents reduce their annual use of heating oil. Kerry said the funding should help improve the efficiency of 1,500 to 3,000 homes.\Helping to pay for weatherization isn't a new idea.\The federal government has provided as much as $3.5 million in weatherization funds annually in recent years. That amount doubled this year along with an increase in emergency heating aid. The money is allocated by regional aid agencies, such as PROP in Portland and the York County Community Action Corp. in Sanford.\In addition, Gov. John Baldacci included $2 million for weatherization as part of his emergency energy plan for this winter.\Most of that money will be allocated by the Maine State Housing Authority in coordination with the regional groups.\And, this week, trustees of a new state fund for fighting global warming issued a call for home weatherization bids from aid agencies.\It plans to allocate as much as $750,000 to the effort as its first use of carbon cap-and-trade revenue.\""It's going to help the environment and also help low-income people address their energy needs,"" said Kerry, one of a group of advisers to the Energy and Carbon Savings Trust. ""It's a very meaningful first step.""\The money represents a portion of the $2.6 million raised last month when Maine auctioned off its first carbon dioxide allowances. Starting next year, large power-generating plants throughout the Northeast, including six in Maine, need to buy the state-issued allowances in order to discharge carbon dioxide.\The so-called cap-and-trade system is intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time. But the periodic auctions also will provide Maine about $15 million to $20 million a year to improve the energy efficiency of homes and businesses. The trustees who oversee that money are required to put 85 percent of it toward electricity conservation and 15 percent toward reducing oil and gas use.\They decided to allocate $750,000 on an emergency basis because of the critical need facing low-income Mainers, trustees said.\""We want to make sure we help but we want to make sure the money is very well spent because we're setting a precedent here,"" said Tom Tietenberg, a retired Colby College professor and one of three trustees.\The money from the carbon auction must still go through a bidding process and is expected to be distributed in January.\Weatherization work will start soon on the first of about 300 homes that will be selected by Maine State Housing, spokesman Dan Simpson said. Local agencies around the state will work with hundreds more. PROP, for example, expects to weatherize about 170 homes this winter, compared to about 120 in past years.\Each home costs an average of $4,000 to weatherize, including the initial audit and then the insulating, sealing and any other work, Bondeson said. In past years, there were more families seeking aid than the group could help, he said.\""To be honest, we've had to walk away from homes that were too expensive to weatherize,"" he said.\Kerry said he hopes those days are over.\""I am confident we are not going to back off,"" he said.\Staff Writer John Richardson can be contacted at 791-6324 or at:\jrichardson@pressherald.com\[Sidebar]\TO GET HELP\HOUSEHOLDS that qualify for the Low Income Heating Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, can also qualify to have their homes weatherized - adding insulation and eliminating leaks.

85,"MERCURY: WHERE IT COMES FROM, HOW IT SPREADS MERCURY is a neurotoxin that can have serious neurological, developmental and behavioral effects in both people and wildlife. Coal- and oil-fired power plants are the largest source of unregulated mercury pollution in the United States, accounting for more than 40 percent of the country's mercury emissions. AIRBORNE MERCURY can be deposited on land and water far from the original source. Mercury that settles in wetlands and shoreline sediments can be converted into methylmercury, a toxic form that enters the aquatic food chain and accumulates in fish and fish-eating wildlife. MERCURY THAT SETTLES in forests can be taken up by the leaves of trees. A recent report says that mercury also is getting converted into methylmercury, perhaps in the moist forest floor, and is showing up in the terrestrial food chain. MAINE is one of 44 states that have issued fish-consumption advisories because of mercury content. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT now estimates that one in six women of childbearing age has unsafe levels of mercury in her body, and more than 630,000 children born in the United States each year are at risk of mercury exposure. A RECENT Harvard study found that health problems from prenatal mercury exposure are irreversible and accumulate as a child ages. TODAY'S QUESTION WHAT DO YOU THINK of the new regulations on mercury pollution? You can answer this question at MaineToday.com.\ The Bush administration imposed rules Tuesday that are designed to cut mercury air pollution by two-thirds over the next 15 years, the nation's first-ever attempt to limit the toxic metal emitted by coal-fired power plants.\ As expected, however, the effort was criticized as inadequate by Maine government officials and environmentalists.\ All four of Maine's representatives in Congress issued statements saying that the administration's approach, which relies on market pressures to gain compliance, calls for too little in the way of reductions that are spread out over too long a time frame.\ Gov. John Baldacci's administration also opposes the approach that sets an overall cap on mercury emissions for the power industry but does not put limits on individual polluters.\ Environmental activists pledged to fight the rule in court.\ ""The Clean Air Task Force intends to challenge the rule and we will win,"" said Conrad Schneider, a Brunswick-based lawyer for the group. ""This violates the Clean Air Act. They can't do that.""\ The rule is the first attempt by any government to regulate mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, according to the Environmental Protection Agency's top air pollution official. It is an important first step, because most mercury contamination in the United States comes from other countries, said Jeffrey Holmstead.\ ""The United States is the first nation to take a leadership role in addressing the problem of mercury from power plants,"" Holmstead said.\ The EPA plan would reduce emissions of mercury from the nation's 600 coal-burning power plants from 48 tons a year now to 38 tons by 2010. By 2018, the limit would drop to 15 tons a year.\ Dan Riedinger, a spokesman for a power industry trade group, said the rule will result in greater reductions sooner than would a requirement that all plants install mercury reduction technology by a certain deadline.\ Under the new rule released Tuesday, the EPA will allow a ""cap- and-trade"" approach that sets a maximum on how much pollution should be allowed, then lets companies trade within those limits. Some companies can increase pollution and buy credits from others that invest in cleaner technology.\ Opponents said the EPA's approach, favored by the utility industry, does not address local problems caused by mercury emissions. Even if overall emissions are reduced, the people who live downwind of a plant that is still producing mercury will suffer. Since Maine is downwind of a number of coal-fired plants that stretch from the New Hampshire border to the Great Lakes states, mercury deposits are likely to continue.\ "" `Cap-and-trade' is OK with other pollutants, but not with mercury, because of the local impacts,"" said Jim Brooks, the director of the Bureau of Air Quality for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.\ Mercury is a heavy metal, like lead, that can cause damage to the brain and nervous system. It is particularly dangerous to fetuses and young children, said Dr. Dora Mills, director of the Maine Bureau of Health.\ Recent studies have shown that mercury contamination is widespread in Maine, even though there are no coal-fired power plants in the state. Researchers have found elevated levels of mercury in birds and other wildlife that do not eat fish and were not previously known to be affected.\ ""Maine people and our environment will pay as high a cost as anyone in the country,"" said Brownie Carson, the director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine.""Fundamentally, this rule will fail to protect the health of our kids and our families.""\ Carson supported a requirement to force each power plant to invest in equipment that would result in a 90 percent reduction in mercury emissions. Industry spokesmen say proven equipment does not now exist, and plants would be forced to convert from coal to natural gas. But Carson and others say the technology does exist.\ Opponents say there are several ways to fight the mercury rule.\ Sen. Susan Collins has submitted legislation that would impose more stringent reductions than those ordered by the EPA.\ Also, a pending lawsuit filed by a coalition of environmental groups seeks to force the EPA to act on the mercury issue. The rule issued Tuesday would not satisfy that request because it calls for steps not listed in the Clean Air Act, said Schneider, one of the group's lawyers.\ The rule itself will be appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, he said.\ The Associated Press contributed to this report.\ Staff Writer Gregory D. Kesich can be contacted at 791-6336 or at:\ gkesich@pressherald.com"

WATERVILLE -- Retired physics professor Howard Hayden does not dispute that global warming is happening.
\
But Hayden is an unabashed contrarian when it comes to assigning blame for the phenomenon.
\
Sports utility vehicle owners are innocent, he told his audience of about 90 people, most of them students, at Colby College on Tuesday afternoon.
\
The culprits, he said, are more likely astronomic and solar events.
\
""You think SUVs are the cause of glaciers shrinking?"" he said to his audience. ""I don't think so.""
\
Hayden, though, certainly could be blamed for heating up debate on global warming causation, as well as debate between Democratic and Republican students at Colby.
\
Colby Republicans were the ones who invited Hayden to speak at the college, a presentation that took place in the Diamond Building.
\
Nathaniel Betz of the Colby Republicans said their objective was simply to provide a balanced account of an important issue.
\
""We are not trying to make this a partisan thing,"" he said.
\
Henry Beck of the Colby Democrats, however, had a different view.
\
""At times it was more an anti-Al Gore presentation,"" Beck said, ""than a scientific presentation.""
\
Hayden did poke fun at Gore in the course of trying to debunk the arguments of ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" Gore's book and movie on global warming.
\
""Don't believe what you hear out of Hollywood and Washington, D.C.,"" Hayden said.
\
Hayden, a physics professor for 32 years at the University of Connecticut, is an editor of a monthly newsletter called ""The Energy Advocate.""
\
He also is the author of the book ""The Solar Fraud: Why Solar Energy Won't Run the World.""
\
In his presentation, Hayden blended humor with computer-generated images of various graphs and charts on global warming and carbon dioxide levels over the centuries and millennia.
\
He argued that climatic history proves that Gore has the relationship between carbon dioxide concentration and global warming backwards.
\
A higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, he said, does not cause the Earth to be warmer.
\
Instead, he said, a warmer Earth causes the higher carbon dioxide levels.
\
""The sun heats up the Earth,"" he said, ""and the oceans warm up and atmospheric carbon dioxide rises.""
\
Hayden said humans' contribution to global carbon dioxide levels is virtually negligible.
\
After the presentation, a Colby student asked Hayden to explain his belief that liberal politicians and the media promote the theory that humans are causing global warming.
\
Hayden said: ""I don't pretend to understand people's motivation. I really don't.""
\
But Hayden also said recent cap and trade policies earmarking big carbon dioxide emitters tend to benefit Third World countries and penalize highly industrialized nations.
\
Jacob Roundtree, executive director of Colby Republicans, said Gore's view on global warming also meshes well with the environmentalist agenda.
\
""Look at the people predisposed to that global warming view,"" he said. ""They happen to be stewards of the environment.""
\
Roundtree said he is not against protecting the environment but opposes promoting false information to achieve that goal.
\
Beck, in turn, rebutted the arguments of Hayden and Roundtree.
\
In a statement e-mailed after the event, Beck said Colby Democrats ""believe that global warming is real and that governments must work toward solutions. Howard Hayden suggested that climate change science is a conspiracy by Al Gore and foreign governments. We reject that notion. This was political event about the issue of global warming.""

89,"AUGUSTA - Gov. John Baldacci has nominated two veteran policymakers in the areas of energy and the environment to serve in prominent positions with the Maine Public Utilities Commission and the University of Maine System.\David Littell, commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, was nominated Monday to serve on the three-member PUC, which regulates electric, gas, water and telecommunications utilities.\Baldacci also nominated a former PUC chairman, Kurt Adams, to serve on the University of Maine System board of trustees. Adams left his position at the PUC in 2008 to take an executive position at First Wind, New England's largest developer of wind power projects.\Legislative committees will hold public hearings on the nominations in the coming weeks before a Senate confirmation session scheduled for Aug. 25.\Littell has served as commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection since January 2006 and previously held the position of deputy commissioner. A graduate of Harvard University Law School and former U.S. Navy Reserve officer, Littell practiced environmental law at the firm Pierce Atwood for more than a decade before joining the DEP.\In a statement announcing the nomination, Baldacci praised Littell for his ability to ""fairly navigate complex regulatory and environmental issues"" and for making the DEP ""more business-friendly without compromising Maine's environment.\Littell said Monday evening that, as commissioner, he has worked with the PUC on energy issues as well as with the commission and utility regulators in other states while developing and implementing the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Serving on the PUC would allow him to continue working directly on those issues.\Additionally, Littell pointed out that he handled telecommunications issues while working in private practice, although he never appeared before the PUC.\As DEP commissioner, Littell helped shepherd through the Legislature Maine's involvement in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the nation's first cap-and-trade system aimed at reducing emissions of carbon dioxide. Littell now serves as chairman of the 10-state initiative.\Maine also has led the nation in enacting regulations to remove lead and other toxic substances from consumer products and, during Littell's tenure, has been heavily involved in national efforts for tougher air quality standards.\But there also have been controversies on issues ranging from the disposal of construction and demolition debris to potential health impacts of smoky outdoor wood boilers.\In one high-profile scrap, the Legislature passed a bill in 2006 intended to protect migratory shorebird habitat. But lawmakers substantially rewrote the law a year later in the wake of opposition from Down East property owners who viewed it as overly restrictive.\More recently, the DEP has found itself at the center of the fight over the siting of industrial wind farms.\A date had not been announced for the Legislature's Utilities and Energy Committee public hearing on Littell's nomination.\For the University of Maine System board of trustees, Baldacci nominated Adams as well as recommended Marjorie Medd of Norway for reappointment to the board.\Adams, a graduate of the University of Maine School of Law, served as Baldacci's chief legal counsel from 2003 to 2005 before being appointed to the PUC. Before that, as an attorney in private practice, Adams represented both power producers and lenders on energy project financing. He now oversees First Wind's project development nationwide.\David Farmer, spokesman for Baldacci, said Adams' experience in the energy industry ""was part of the equation but it wasn't the only factor"" in his nomination to the board. The University of Maine has sizable research programs into development of the next generation of wind turbines and other renewable energy technologies.\Farmer said the governor believes Adams will bring valuable talents and insights to the board.\""The board of trustees brings together people with broad backgrounds,"" Farmer said. ""It is not just people with experience in education policy.""\Adams has, himself, been at the center of a controversy in recent months focused on his final months of service on the PUC before joining First Wind. Some critics have suggested that Adams had a conflict of interest and may have received a type of stock option from First Wind before leaving the commission.\The company has since blamed the confusion on when Adams received the compensation on a clerical error, and the Maine Attorney General's Office found no evidence of wrongdoing.\Sen. Elizabeth Schneider, an Orono Democrat who serves on the Legislature's Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, praised Medd's service on the board and said she believes Adams is a strong candidate.\Schneider said she believes the board needs free thinkers who can help figure out ways to tackle the financial and economic challenges facing both the university and the state as a whole.\""These people are very thoughtful and intelligent,"" Schneider said. ""At the same time, I am keeping a very open mind and I want to hear what people have to say at the public hearing.""\Credit: KEVIN MILLER OF THE NEWS STAFF"
90,"Clean Power Plan is a step toward sunshine for Maine's economy\The solar industry is growing fast. Partly because costs of installation are falling across the nation with each new investment, another home or business is going solar in the United States every 2.5 minutes. Since 2010 alone, prices have fallen by 46 percent. \That rapid growth is being felt right here in Maine, where 3.5 megawatts of solar capacity were installed in Maine in 2014, a 43 percent increase over a single year. \Even sunnier news: Solar energy is poised to play a major role in Maine's transition to a cleaner future. That's exactly why we need the Clean Power Plan, which was released last month by the Environmental Protection Agency. \The plan is the biggest step the country's ever taken on climate change. These new standards will cut carbon pollution from dirty coal, gas and oil power plants by 30 percent by the year 2030. The plan allows flexibility for states to cut emissions how they choose, but rewards states that choose to invest in renewables. \""Solar works in all 50 states, has zero carbon emissions, creates more jobs per megawatt than any other technology and can be deployed cost-effectively and quickly - all while improving grid reliability,"" said Rhone Resch, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a national trade group, following the Clean Power Plan's release. \The Clean Power Plan builds on the incredible momentum that Maine's businesses, communities, and individuals have already built through their investments in solar. \On Earth Day this past April, the sun shone on Maine's first community solar farm in South Paris. Community solar farms offer more Mainers the opportunity to get in on the solar boom while saving on their electricity bills. Community solar farms reach the 85 percent of customers who aren't able to invest in solar because their properties are unsuitable. On Aug. 12, another community solar farm opened in Edgecomb. \As we rely less and less on polluting coal and gas plants, Mainers have the opportunity to become energy independent through investing in solar. The number one obstacle is the will of decision-makers. \Behind California, Massachusetts employs the second most workers in the solar industry. Maine is ranked 43rd, with just over 400 jobs at 43 companies. The reason for the discrepancy between Maine and Massachusetts: The only state in New England without a solar development policy in place is Maine. \At the same time, federal tax credits for solar investments are scheduled to expire by the end of 2016. Potential projects would be left in flux as costs will rise if the credits are allowed to expire. \That's why Maine Solar Solutions has joined over 670 installers, manufacturers and others in the industry - including 12 businesses from Maine - on a letter last month to the White House, endorsing the Clean Power Plan and calling for solar energy to play a strong role in its rollout. \The Clean Power Plan is a huge step forward. When the Clean Power Plan was announced Aug. 3, solar incentives came with it. The rule's Clean Energy Incentive Program will reward states that choose to cut their emissions by investing in solar. \Furthermore, under the program, credits will be awarded to projects that generate renewable energy in 2020 and 2021, and begin construction after a state submits their implementation plan. These incentives will drive quicker investment in solar, with the goal of making clean energy affordable for all Mainers. \Maine has proven that it's up to the challenge to create a cleaner energy future. Since joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in 2009, the regional cap-and-trade program has cut Maine's emissions while saving Mainers on their electricity bills. According to ""States of Progress,"" a recent report by the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group, Maine is on track to surpass its 2030 pollution reduction targets because of its participation in RGGI. \Maine's government can and should do more to support one of the state's most promising industries, for the future of our economy and environment. We can't afford tax credits expiring in 2016. We can't afford the Gulf of Maine's rapid warming. \Simply put: Maine can't continue business as usual. The Clean Power Plan is the beginning of a more sustainable economic and environmental future. \As big polluters and their allies ramp up their opposition to the Clean Power Plan in Congress, it's vital that Mainers stand for a clean energy future. We hope that Sen. Susan Collins - a key vote in the Senate - will also stand with Mainers for the sake of our environment, sustainable industries and future generations. \-- Special to the Press Herald"
91,"BAR HARBOR - Governors from six New England states and provincial leaders from eastern Canada discussed Tuesday how they might work together to improve regional transportation, energy generation and transmission, and economies.\Coming up with a uniform weight limit for trucks, pursuing renewable energy projects, increasing cross-border transmission capabilities, and boosting the region's economy despite a declining population were among the topics tackled by the state and provincial officials.\During the morning part of the daylong New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers Conference, officials cited the disparate weight limits between the two countries and among the New England states as a hindrance to economic growth.\In Maine, truck weights on Interstate 95 are limited to 100,000 pounds south of Augusta but they are limited to 80,000 north of the state capital. In Canada, trucks can travel with two trailers on the federal highway system and can carry more than 137,500 pounds. This disparity complicates traffic patterns by forcing heavy trucks to take circuitous routes through northern New England as they travel from the Maritime Provinces to southern New England or west to Quebec.\Maine Gov. John Baldacci and Vermont Gov. James Douglas each lamented the effect the truck weight limits have on the region, but not just on its economy. Baldacci said that though safety advocacy groups claim the limits make highway travel safer, they actually make it ""more dangerous"" on the secondary roads and in the small towns where the heavier trucks are forced to go.\Douglas agreed that one truck weight limit for the entire region would be good for the economy and for public safety.\""It's been so frustrating for our state,"" Douglas said. ""It's been environmentally detrimental to our state by forcing trucks to go through our small towns. We need to get some effort to get uniformity.""\Glen Weisbrod of Economic Development Research Group, who helped manage a recent transportation study of the two-nation region, told the elected executives about possible improvement projects that could make it easier for vehicles and goods to move in and through the states and provinces. There are several highways that run north and south through the region, but not so many that run east and west, he said.\By not improving the transportation network, by 2020 there could be ""scary"" bottlenecks in metropolitan areas such as Boston and New York, where many of the north-south highways converge, according to Weisbrod. He said that the projects that have been suggested, which include an east-west highway through northern Maine, could have a total cost of between $5 billion and $8 billion.\""It's good chunk of money, but the benefits are three-to-one for the region,"" Weisbrod said.\Greg Nadeau, deputy commissioner of policy, planning and communications for the Maine Department of Transportation, told the officials that states and provinces will have to try some innovative funding methods to come up with that kind of investment money. Maine has relied on motor fuel taxes to fund its road improvements, he said, but because escalating fuel prices are causing motorists to drive less, using fuel taxes alone will not generate the kind of revenue needed for transportation infrastructure projects.\Nadeau cited the seasonal Island Explorer bus system on Mount Desert Island as an example of how transportation projects can be funded from new sources. Twenty entities, many of them government agencies at different levels, help fund the free bus system, but much of its money is provided by outdoor retailer L.L. Bean, he said, which has contributed more than $1 million to the system's costs.\""How it was funded had to be innovative, particularly in sight of the realities of the financial burdens on state and local governments,"" Nadeau said.\When it comes to other aspects of the existing transportation system, Jean Charest, premier of Quebec, spoke up about how the participating states and provinces can help mitigate the effect of automotive emissions on the environment.\Charest said his province supports adopting emissions standards that have been championed and implemented in California, which has set a goal of reducing tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent within the next eight years. Last year, automobile manufacturers unsuccessfully sued the state of California, which voted in 2002 to adopt the standards. The manufacturers argued that the state law should be pre-empted by federal regulations and United States foreign policy.\Charest encouraged his fellow premiers and the New England governors to endorse the same standards and to inform their respective federal governments of that support.\""In Quebec, we have taken the position that we support California standards, [but] we've never said we will do it alone,"" Charest said. ""As far as I know, we would be the first region to speak to that.""\Charest also said that he supports pursuing a cap-and-trade approach to limiting the amount of automotive emissions into the atmosphere. By such a system, some polluters could acquire the rights to create more emissions than others as long as the total amount of emissions by all polluters did not pass a certain limit.\Connecticut Gov. Jodi Rell, Nova Scotia Premier Rodney MacDonald, Vermont Gov. Douglas, Rhode Island Gov. Donald Carcieri and Baldacci each indicated later in the day that they also support implementing the California tailpipe standards throughout North America as much as possible.\In a similar vein, the officials also heard about environmentally friendly energy projects that are being pursued in the region. Quebec has spearheaded many hydroelectric and wind power projects over the years, but other states and provinces are beginning to catch up.\Several thousand megawatts of renewable energy sources likely will come online in the region in the coming decades, according to Christian Brosseau of Hydro Quebec USA, including wind power projects in Maine. But transmission capacity also needs to be enhanced, both for electricity and natural gas, if the new sources of energy are to meet the region's needs, industry officials said.\Baldacci said later that Maine could miss out on the benefits of these new energy projects if it withdraws from ISO New England, the operator of the New England regional power grid.\He said Maine Public Utilities Commission is studying the issue to weigh the pluses and minuses of being part of the electric entity. Proponents of withdrawal from ISO New England have said that Maine residents pay more than they should of the regional power rates.\Whatever is decided, Baldacci said, the state will work with its neighbors to make sure that Maine residents and the surrounding states and provinces benefit from regional energy projects as much as possible. He said Tuesday's talks make him optimistic that Maine will be able to continue working with its neighbors going forward.\""We can't do everything all by ourselves,"" he said. ""We're part of New England. We're part of this region. I'm encouraged, we're not at the end of the road yet, but we'll wait and see what happens.""\Premier Robert Ghiz of Prince Edward Island was not at Tuesday's conference because he had to attend a funeral for former PEI Premier Bennett Campbell, according to New Brunswick Premier Shawn Graham. Campbell, who had cancer, died Sept. 11 at age 65 from complications of cancer.\George Webster, PEI's environment minister, attended the conference on Ghiz's behalf, taking his place among the other premiers and governors seated at the large central table set up in the Bar Harbor Club's main ballroom.\Next year's conference is scheduled for Sept. 15-17 in Saint John, New Brunswick."

\
Santorum: Favors constitutional abortion ban and opposes abortion, including in cases of rape.
\
Debt
\
Gingrich: As House speaker in 1990s, engineered passage of a seven-year balanced-budget plan. It was vetoed but helped form a bipartisan balanced budget later.
\
Paul: Would eviscerate federal government, slashing nearly half its spending, shut five Cabinet-level agencies, end spending on existing conflicts and on foreign aid.
\
Romney: Defended financial sector bailout, criticized GM and Chrysler bailout. Cap federal spending at 20 percent of GDP.
\
Santorum: Freeze social and military spending for five years to cut $5 trillion from federal budgets.
\
Economy
\
Gingrich: Repeal the financial industry regulations that followed the Wall Street meltdown. Restrict the Fed's power to set interest rates artificially low.
\
Paul: Return to the gold standard, eliminate the Federal Reserve, eliminate most federal regulations.
\
Romney: Lower taxes, less regulation, balanced budget, more trade deals to spur growth. Replace jobless benefits with unemployment savings accounts. Repeal new financial-industry regulations.
\
Santorum: Eliminate corporate taxes for manufacturers, drill for more oil and gas, and slash regulations.
\
Education
\
Gingrich: Shrink Education Department. But supported Obama administration's $4 billion Race to the Top grant competition for states.
\
Paul: Abolish the Education Department and end the federal role in education.
\
Romney: Supported No Child Left Behind law. Once favored shutting Education Department, later saw its value in ""holding down the interests of the teachers' unions.""
\
Santorum: Voted for No Child Left Behind law, now regrets vote. Wants ""significantly"" smaller Education Department but not its elimination.
\
Energy
\
Gingrich: Let oil and natural gas industries drill offshore reserves now blocked from development, end restrictions on Western oil shale development.
\
Paul: Remove restrictions on drilling, coal and nuclear power, eliminate gasoline tax, provide tax credits for alternative fuel technology.
\
Romney: Supports drilling in the Gulf, the outer continental shelves, Western lands, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and offshore Alaska; and exploitation of shale oil deposits.
\
Santorum: Favors drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, scaling back ""oppressive regulation"" hindering drilling elsewhere, and eliminating energy subsidies in four years.
\
Environment
\
Gingrich: Convert EPA into ""environmental solutions agency"" devoted to research and ""more energy, more jobs and a better environment simultaneously."" Once backed tougher environmental regulation.
\
Paul: Previously said human activity ""probably does"" contribute to global warming; now calls such science a ""hoax."" Says emission standards should be set by states or regions.
\
Romney: Acknowledged that humans contribute to global warming, but later said ""we don't know what's causing climate change."" Cap and trade would ""rocket energy prices.""
\
Santorum: The science establishing human activity as a likely contributor to global warming is ""patently absurd"" and ""junk science.""
\
Gay marriage
\
Gingrich: If the Defense of Marriage Act fails, ""you have no choice except a constitutional amendment"" to ban gay marriage.
\
Paul: Decisions on legalizing or prohibiting gay marriage should be left to states.
\
Romney: Favors constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, says policy should be set federally, not by states.
\
Santorum: Supports constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, not leaving decision to states. ""We can't have 50 marriage laws.""
\
Health care
\
All would seek repeal of Obama's health care law.
\
Gingrich: Prohibit insurers from cancelling or charging hefty increases to insurance holders who get sick. Offer ""generous"" tax credit to help buy insurance. Previously supported mandatory coverage.
\
Paul: Opposes compulsory insurance and all federal subsidies for coverage.
\
Romney: Opposes federal mandate to obtain coverage; introduced mandate in Massachusetts. Proposes ""generous"" subsidies to help future retirees buy private insurance instead of going on Medicare.
\
Santorum: Would seek to starve Obama's health care law of money needed to implement it. Supported Bush administration's prescription drug program for the elderly, now regrets doing so.
\
Immigration
\
Gingrich: In contrast to most rivals, supports option of giving legal status to illegal immigrants with deep roots in the U.S. and who have lived otherwise lawfully. Supports path to citizenship for illegal immigrants' children who perform U.S. military service. Make English the official language. Divert more Homeland Security assets to at Mexican border.
\

"
93,"Eliot Cutler\For Cutler, an independent from Cape Elizabeth, the first steps toward true, long-term economic growth begin by lowering the costs of health care, energy and government combined with changing the regulatory environment in state government.\""Those, in my view, are much more important, much more realistic and much more meaningful to job creation than anything else,"" Cutler said recently.\Cutler wants to create an Energy Finance Authority that will take advantage of its status as a public entity to secure low-interest, tax-exempt financing for energy infrastructure projects or to help private businesses reduce their energy costs.\The authority could also partner with the private sector to build renewable energy generation facilities and to spur expansion of the heavy manufacturing companies needed to support the green energy economy in Maine. Cutler said the authority could help negotiate public-private partnerships to bring natural gas lines to industries along the Penobscot, Kennebec and Androscoggin rivers.\On health care, Cutler has proposed a Maine Wellness program focused on encouraging high-quality, preventative care modeled after corporate wellness programs. He has also proposed using the state's financial leverage through MaineCare to push for more efficient, higher-quality care.\At the center of Cutler's government reform platform would be a newly created Office of Regulatory Review and Repeal to change or eliminate rules and regulations deemed unnecessary or harmful to business growth. He has proposed abolishing the Board of Environmental Protection and changing the regulatory culture to be business friendly.\""Our regulations are tough, and they ought to be tough,"" Cutler said. ""But the way we are implementing those regulations creates an unpredictable or uncertain environment that drives people away from Maine.""\Cutler's other job-related initiatives include:\. Consolidating the state's economic development activities now located in different departments into the Department of Commerce and Tourism.\. Developing ""the Maine brand"" to expand both tourism and exports, promoting Maine more as a four-season destination and encouraging schools to start after Labor Day.\. Capitalizing on Maine's location between Canada and the northeastern U.S. by investing in ports, rail lines, roads and other infrastructure to help move energy and goods.\Paul LePage\During the roll-out of his job creation plan in late summer, LePage talked about the need to create an ""EZ Pass"" system for businesses largely by lessening perceived regulatory burdens.\At the heart of his regulatory reform program is a proposal to require that every state agency review rules ""to prove their regulatory policies improve Maine and are not just a roadblock to new job opportunities.""\LePage, the Republican mayor of Waterville and an executive at Marden's, said he would also institute a policy in which state agencies have 90 days to respond to new business permits.\In an interview, LePage said that does not mean the agency will have to make a decision within 90 days. Instead, he said agencies will have to provide businesses with a ""90-day road map,"" based on a preliminary review, detailing all of the steps needed to complete their project so that the applicant knows the costs up front.\""In 90 days, you can tell me if it is doable or not doable,"" LePage said. ""If it's not doable, why not? And if it is doable, then what do we need to do?""\LePage has also proposed requiring state agencies to conduct an impact assessment of every proposed new regulation to determine the impact on jobs and small businesses. The program in Maine would be based on recommendations provided by the federal Small Business Administration that have already been adopted by several states.\""We do environmental impacts,"" LePage said. ""I want to do a job-cost impact study.""\In order to lower health care costs, LePage has proposed allowing Maine citizens and businesses to purchase insurance across state lines and scaling back Maine's health mandates to be in line with national averages.\He said he would also pursue tort reform to cut down on what is described as frivolous lawsuits driving up the costs of medical care.\Other LePage job-creation proposals include:\. Institute a $5 filing fee - down from $145 - for new businesses seeking to incorporate in the state.\. Create additional tax exemptions for business purchases.\. Pursue a diverse energy mix, including hydro, wind, biomass, solar, tidal and nuclear as well as deals with Canadian firms to negotiate lower-cost energy and transmission lines.\Libby Mitchell\Mitchell has argued that Maine can create new, sustainable jobs by investing in Maine's ""green economy"" through a dual focus on conservation measures and development of renewable energy sources as well as by strengthening programs aimed at encouraging business investment.\She would expand the current focus on home and business weatherization by continuing to seek federal funding and dedicating revenues from the cap-and-trade program known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative toward conservation.\""Since 80 percent of our homes are heated with oil and we have the oldest housing stock, for the foreseeable future there is plenty of work to be done in terms of conservation,"" Mitchell said.\Additionally, Mitchell has proposed weatherizing all Maine schools through a new guaranteed loan program in which schools would finance the projects through their energy savings at no cost to the state.\Mitchell has also proposed expanding or modernizing the Seed Capital Tax Credit program, which provide tax credits for investors that provide equity to eligible small businesses.\To help avert business closures or layoffs, Mitchell has proposed creating a ""Rapid Response Program"" within the governor's office featuring experts who would help develop new business strategies or assist with financing.\""We would like to make sure we are reaching out to industries before the crisis,"" Mitchell said.\During Mitchell's time as Senate president, the Legislature has passed two bond packages containing more than $200 million, largely for roads and infrastructure projects.\Mitchell said she would once again propose a ""a robust and responsible bond package"" for critical projects, including roads, bridges, ports and rail as well as drinking water infrastructure, and research and development.\Mitchell's other job creation proposals include:\. Creation of a ""Management for Maine"" program to coordinate existing programs that provide management and skills training to small or mid-sized companies.\. Encourage the use of locally grown or harvested foods by requiring that at least 25 percent of all food served in schools, prisons and state facilities be grown in Maine.\. Explore public-private partnerships to bring natural gas lines to Augusta and Waterville.\Shawn Moody\For Moody, the best way to ""grow our way"" out of the current recession is by focusing on improving the business climate, increasing tax incentives to businesses and lowering energy and health care costs.\Moody, the founder of New England's largest chain of vehicle collision repair shops, believes more of Maine's economic development efforts - and money - needs to be focused in-state helping local companies and industries rather than trying to attract new ones.\While the state needs to market itself elsewhere - especially when it comes to tourism - Moody said Maine also needs to focus on improving the business climate here first, which will help later in attracting new companies.\Moody said Maine could follow the federal government's lead in two key areas.\First, he has proposed expanding a tax incentive that allows business owners to deduct the costs of new equipment and other eligible purchases on their income taxes as an expense - something known as ""accelerated depreciation."" In Maine, accelerated depreciation is capped at $25,000 while the feds allow up to $250,000.\""This is a tax incentive that would actually be a revenue generator for the state and local communities"" by encouraging new purchases, Moody said.\Secondly, Moody said he wants Maine to follow the federal government by allowing business owners to offset losses in one year by carrying them forward into the next.\Moody has also proposed easing some regulatory requirements on what he calls ""micro businesses,"" which are operations with only a handful of employees.\In the area of health care, Moody said Maine should look to New Hampshire for guidance on how to create a more competitive insurance market. That will likely require Maine to reduce its insurance mandates, he said.\Moody's other job-creation proposals include:\. Strengthen Maine's vocational education programs to give non-college bound students the training they need to get jobs and start their own business.\. Conduct ""exit interviews"" with Maine companies that leave the state, close or downsize to find out the reasons.\. A two-pronged energy strategy focused on continuing the state's conservation efforts while encouraging the development of all types of renewable energy.\Kevin Scott\Scott's approach to job creation focuses on rebuilding Maine's agricultural economy through local markets while working to improve the state's approach to recruiting new businesses.\An independent candidate from Andover, Scott said he wants to transform Maine's agriculture industry by requiring that all public schools - grades kindergarten through 12 - serve food that is grown by Maine farmers.\In order to meet the new demand for locally sourced food, Scott has proposed state incentives for farmers that expand or build large greenhouses for year-round agriculture.\One example of an incentive that Scott has offered is a state revolving loan fund - similar to the type currently used for public water infrastructure projects - wherein farmers could receive low-interest or no-interest loans for the greenhouse projects. Funding for the loan program likely would come from voter-approved bonds.\""It's a revolving loan fund, so it requires repayment,"" he said.\By expanding Maine's farming industry and focusing on year-round agriculture, the state will be providing jobs not just to farmers but to equipment dealers, the construction trades, engineers and university researchers developing the latest technology, Scott said.\""You create wealth across all Maine demographics,"" he said.\Scott, who runs a recruiting firm for high-tech companies, said he also believes the state could benefit by replicating some of the recruiting techniques of the corporate world.\For instance, he has proposed converting some state employees focused on economic development to a commission-based system in which they will be compensated for attracting new jobs.\Scott's other job-creation plans include:\. Renegotiate Maine's contract with the ISO-New England power pool for lower rates, although he has also suggested possible withdrawal from the pool.\. Contact the Top 10 ""business-friendly states"" to better understand their strategies and attempt to emulate them in Maine."
94,"When New Hampshire developed stricter air pollution laws for power plants in 1998, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, the state's major electric utility, pulled out all the stops.\Investing $2 million, the company upgraded controls on nitrogen oxide emissions from its Merrimack power station in Bow, near Concord. The improvements yielded results: The plant cut pollution so far below new limits that Public Service was able to sell its excess reductions -- called ""allowances"" -- to other plants in a new trading program for utilities in the Northeast.\The company then used the income from the sale to add pollution controls at another facility, the Schiller plant in Portsmouth, reducing emissions there by 50 percent.\""Here in New Hampshire, the end result is there for everyone to see,"" says Martin Murray, a Public Service spokesman. ""We have lowered our emissions 85 percent year-round. That's a tremendous achievement over 1990 levels.""\At a public hearing in Augusta on Thursday, FPL Energy -- the owner of the Wyman Station power plant in Yarmouth -- will ask the Maine Board of Environmental Protection to join the same regional emissions trading program that New Hampshire's utility used to cut its air pollution to record low levels.\But the plan is already drawing fierce criticism. FPL does not plan to reduce regional air pollution by making big cuts in emissions in Yarmouth. Rather, the company would use the trading program to purchase emissions cuts at another plant in the Northeast.\FPL thinks it will save money that way, because other plants can cut their emissions for less money than Wyman.\The FPL plan would improve Maine's air quality, regulators and utility officials say, because the company would be paying for a reduction in air pollution that would otherwise drift here from states upwind.\But some residents see FPL's plan as a cop-out. ""Our initial reaction is that it's a ploy to appease us and the state,"" says Joan Magnant, a neighbor of the plant who lives on Cousins Island in Yarmouth. ""What I want to know is what it means in my back yard? I haven't had a good explanation of that, to date.""\Magnant and others argue that the state should require FPL to make all emissions cuts at the Cousins Island plant.\Local residents and environmentalists say that too little is known about Wyman's role as a pollution source, and that the Yarmouth plant may harm air quality along the Maine coast more than other plants far away.\The board will hear testimony on the proposal at Thursday's hearing, scheduled for 1 p.m. at the Holiday Inn near the Augusta Civic Center. A final decision will probably be made in February.\Emotions are high among critics. Wyman Station is a major smog producer. It is among hundreds of power plants from Maine to the Midwest that are major sources of nitrogen oxides, gases formed when fossil fuels are burned. Emissions combine with other exhaust gases known as hydrocarbons in the presence of heat and sunlight to form ground-level ozone, or smog.\Wyman Station is the single-largest producer of nitrogen oxide in Maine.\In 1994, Maine joined with 10 other Northeastern states and the District of Columbia in an agreement to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by up to 70 percent by 2003. The agreement proposed a regional emissions trading program.\Seven states have already joined the program -- New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Maryland will join this year. Joining requires approval by the state Department of Enivornmental Protection.\Under the trading system, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, states agreed to cap total nitrogen oxide emissions from plants at 219,000 tons in 1999. The limit represents a 55 percent reduction from the baseline year, 1990.\In 2003, the regional cap drops to 143,000 tons, a 70 percent cut from 1990 levels.\Each state is allotted a share of the regional total of allowable emissions, a figure that is based on 1990 air pollution levels in the state.\The states then allocate emission levels to individual plants within their borders, based on the plants' past operations and other policy considerations.\What a plant is allowed to release is divided up by slices of pie, with some getting more and others getting less.\For example, if a state is allocated 10,000 tons of emissions a year under the cap, and one power plant historically produced 25 percent of total emissions in that state, then the plant would face a 2,500-ton emissions limit under the trading program.\The opportunity to make trades gives utilities a lot of flexibility.\Plants can buy only the pollution controls they need to comply with their limit, or they can spend more and reduce emissions more than the rules require, creating excess emission allowances they can sell on the open market.\In New Hampshire, Public Service Company was allocated 4,674 tons of emissions a year for its three plants. The pollution controls it purchased actually reduced emissions to 3,462 tons. That left 1,208 tons of emissions a year available for sale to other plants, along with another 1,669 tons a year of credit the company received for cuts made just before the trading program went into effect.\EPA records show that Public Service has sold 9,184 tons of emission allowances on the nitrogen oxide trading market. The buyers included utilities in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and several brokerage firms.\The price of the allowances was not disclosed, but the cost per ton has ranged from a high of $7,000 to a low of about $700 since the market opened.\Joseph Fontaine, who administers the trading program in New Hampshire for the Department of Environmental Services, said emissions trading has worked well for the utility company and the environment.\""I feel very good about it,"" he said. ""I think we've done remarkably well.""\In Maine, the DEP has proposed a 75 percent cut in emissions from Wyman. The cap is comparable to curbs placed on other plants in Northeastern states. But the DEP is not offering to create a trading program.\FPL Energy -- a corporate subsidiary of Florida Power and Light that owns Wyman -- wants the trading option so it can use emissions allowances to help it reach the standard proposed by the state.\Until the state acts on the proposal, it's unclear just how many tons of pollution Wyman would be allowed to release. But the plant's recent operations offer some examples of how the program might work.\In 1998, the plant produced about 1,200 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions. To meet the limits under the program proposed by the state, FPL would have to install pollution controls that cut those emissions by 900 tons.\Under the trading program, FPL would cut Wyman's emissions by perhaps 700 tons by installing pollution controls in Yarmouth. FPL would then buy another 200 tons of emissions allowances from another plant.\""If we find that it's not cost effective to buy allowances, then we'll limit the amount we operate,"" says Allen Wiley, an FPL spokesman in Maine. ""That's what the market's there for. It's to allow you to make decisions.""\Wiley says if the state requires all pollution reductions to be made at Wyman, it will cost the company $50 million. Trading for some emissions allowances would lower the price to about $10 million, he says.\The difference is a major savings for FPL, which is trying to position the Yarmouth plant to compete in the newly deregulated electricity market in New England.\But there's a lot at stake for Maine residents, too -- especially those who live near or downwind of the plant.\In the residential neighborhoods on Cousins Island, where Wyman is located, people have complained about oily fumes and soot deposits from the plant.\Dr. David Adams, a recently retired cardiologist from Cousins Island, says the plant's soot emissions contain chemical compounds and heavy metals that have been associated with cancer and developmental disabilities.\He says he's afraid the emissions may cause health problems that won't be recognized until it's too late.\""It took us 50 years to learn that something as obvious as cigarette smoke causes cancer,"" Adams says. ""I'm afraid that we may wake up to find that this is a real threat and that it broadcasts its pollution in a much wider area than we think it does.""\Adams and several other residents have formed a citizens group called HELP, for Halt Emissions, Less Pollution, and will testify at Thursday's hearing before the state environmental board.\He said he wants the board to hold Wyman to the same standards that apply to modern plants and require signficant cuts in emissions.\Adams says he also opposes emissions trading.\""This plant has a disproportionate effect on air quality in the midcoast and Casco Bay,"" he says. ""I feel very strongly that trading is bad for the midcoast, because it would allow the plant to exceed levels of pollution that it would otherwise have to adhere to.""\Officials at the DEP and FPL says Maine's air will be cleaner even if Wyman is allowed to buy emissions allowances from plants outside the state.\They say the cuts Wyman pays for at other plants will reduce the pollution that flows in over Maine's borders and contributes to its smog problem.\But the chemistry of smog formation is so complex, and the problem so widespread, that regulators can't say exactly what role Wyman plays in the problem.\In the absence of solid answers, the board's decision may hinge on perceptions of equity and the demands of residents for a cleaner local environment.\The Natural Resources Council of Maine, the state's major environmental advocacy group, argues local people deserve to know they will not bear the burden of higher pollution if Wyman pursues emissions trading.\Sue Jones, a council staff member, says her organization believes Wyman should have to meet the same emissions standards as modern plants, by installing its own pollution controls locally.\""We don't want to shut it down, but we do want it to run clean,"" she says. ""It's a fairness isssue. Fairness to other power plants, fairness to local communities, fairness to all of us.""\Staff Writer Dieter Bradbury can be contacted at 791-6328 or at: dbradbury@pressherald.com"

State House Bureau
\
For a time, during the heated Congressional clashes over health care reform, many thought the most powerful politician in Washington was not President Barack Obama, but a thin, raven-haired three-term senator from Maine.
\
""We as a party have spent the last six months, the greatest minds in our party, dwelling on the question, the unbelievably consuming question of how to get Olympia Snowe to vote on health care reform,"" thundered U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, in a noted House floor speech on Oct. 8, 2009.
\
""I want to remind us all that Olympia Snowe was not elected President last year. Olympia Snowe has no veto power in the Senate. Olympia Snowe represents a state with one half of one percent of America's population.""
\
Grayson was referring his party's frantic courtship of Sen. Olympia Snowe, the Maine Republican whose willingness to partner with Democrats on health care only seemed to deliver bipartisan anger and frustration.
\
Liberal Democrats were concerned more progressive aspects of the bill would be slashed by Senate Democratic leadership looking to cut a deal. Meanwhile, Republicans feared Snowe would blast a hole in their unified opposition.
\
Snowe had broken from the GOP on health care reform by voting for the Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill -- the only Republican on the five congressional committees of oversight that it to do so.
\
This earned her not only boos from critics, but also salt.
\
""Olympia Snowe has sold out the country,"" wrote Erick Erickson on his conservative blog, Red State. ""So we should melt her. What melts snow? Rock salt. I'm going to ship this 5 pound bag of rock salt to her office in Maine. It's only $3. You should join me. It is a visible demonstration of our contempt for her. First she votes for the stimulus. Now this.""
\
According to the Wall Street Journal, one hardware store in Indianapolis received nearly 250 mail orders for five-pound bags of rock salt from across the country, all to be delivered to Snowe's office in Portland.
\
(Snowe staffers said the salt did arrive -- and was donated to Preble Street, which provides shelter and other aid for the homeless and needy.)
\
Voting for reform should have cemented Snowe's place at the negotiating table, since at that time, Democrats were desperate for 60 Senate votes to overcome a promised Republican filibuster.
\
Spurred by repeated sentiments like Grayson's, however, Democratic leaders in the Senate abandoned the version of reform supported by Snowe for one more favored by the liberal wing of the party.
\
This left Snowe -- who endured bitterness, jealousy and contempt from inside and outside Congress while working for the bill -- feeling jettisoned by Democrats who said one thing, but really meant another.
\
In hindsight, Snowe said this process offered a new meaning of bipartisanship.
\
""(The Democratic) version of bipartisanship is my vote for their bill,"" she said in a recent interview. ""It's an either/or environment at a time in which we need to be solving these great problems.""
\
'Stay centered'
\
The push-pull nature of the health care debate was trying, Snowe said.
\
""You are in this partisan divide and as one who's straddling it, or trying to the very best I can, you just have to stay focused, don't lose your values and do what you've always done,"" she said. ""That's sort of the advice I give to myself. You just have to stay totally centered, know why you are there, for what reasons, who you represent, why you came, what you are doing and what's the problem you are trying to solve. And that's what I've done.""
\
Snowe staffers say one of the boss' favorite saying is, ""Process dictates product.""
\
""The idea is, like anything, if you do the right thing, and you build a real consensus, then you can bring people across,"" she said. ""And that just has not been (the Democrats') impetus,"" she said.
\
Despite this disenchantment, however, Snowe remains a bellwether on Capitol Hill. In addition to being the lone Republican to vote for any version of health care, she also supported the economic stimulus package, financial regulatory reform and a $26 billion state aid package.
\
Snowe and fellow Mainer U.S. Sen Susan Collins were among the few Republicans to support those bills. Snowe has voted with Republicans 67 percent of the time in this Congress, according to The Washington Post.
\
Collins has the same percentage, giving Maine's senators the lowest percentage of party-line votes in the Senate.
\
While Collins commanded the spotlight in stimulus talks, Snowe worked quietly to help shape the $787 billion measure by bringing the White House lists of spending initiatives she thought should be cut or added.
\
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, the Obama administration's envoy to Congress, said the pair have represented Maine well.
\
""They are fierce about their independence and about their pragmatism,"" he said in a recent interview. ""When they look at a piece of legislation, their first question is, 'What is the immediate impact on Maine and how does this affect Maine?' They are tough about it, they keep asking the kind of core questions that need to be asked.""
\
Election outlook
\
Their perch in the middle has created an interesting dynamic at home for Maine's senators, however.
\
Earlier this year, the Maine Republican Party made national headlines for adopting a strict, conservative party platform that supports, for example, the elimination of the federal Department of Education and the Federal Reserve.
\
Despite this, the chairman of the Maine GOP said Maine Republicans are not disappointed with Snowe and Collins' votes on the stimulus. ""No,"" said Charlie Webster. ""(But) I don't believe is the vote was held today that they would necessarily vote that way again.""
\
Webster believes the mood of the current party may influence the senators going forward, especially if Republicans have a strong showing in November's state legislative races. He defines political independence as a willingness to oppose party leadership, if that is what constituents expect.
\
""I expect that they will still be independent but I think they will be more comfortable voting in a more Republican, conservative way if they understand that people in Maine also agree with that,"" he said.
\
Snowe, however, stands by her vote. She said the economy would now be worse without the spending bill.
\
""It was mindful of small business, low income families, those that were unemployed and those who were desperate to hang onto their jobs,"" she said of the final package. ""Could we have done better? Absolutely. Could we have done it differently? Absolutely.""
\
The senators could have the chance to do things differently, if Republicans in Congress have a strong November showing. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, the minority leader in the Senate, said if Congress tilts right, the currency of centrists like Snowe and Collins would increase.
\
""Regretfully from my point of view, and I think the two Maine senators would agree with me, this administration and the majority in Congress have basically pursued pretty far left agendas,"" he said. ""I think if there is a shift in the Congress this November, the president is likely to move to the political center and you can bet that Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins will be right in the middle of negotiating agreements that will inevitably be made in the center.""
\
'Respect for the process'
\
It's in negotiating that Snowe, and Collins, have earned cross-aisle accolades from fellow senators.
\
""(Snowe) was deeply engaged throughout health reform's evolution, regularly working to ensure families and small businesses in Maine and across the country would benefit from the new law,"" said U.S. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, chair of the Senate Finance Committee. ""Sen. Snowe's tremendously hard work made the health care bill a better bill. In an increasingly toxic political environment in Washington, she only cared about one thing -- delivering for Maine.""
\
U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., said the style used by Snowe and Collins used to be more prevalent among his colleagues, but no longer.
\
""Both of them have a deep respect for process in the Senate, which makes them almost unique, not just among Republicans but amongst senators,"" he said, referring to both of Maine's senators in a recent interview. ""I don't know what it is in the water, but there is something unique about the place that produces some damn good people.""
\
In Maine, their efforts are respected, if not lauded.
\
Tarren Bragdon, chief executive of the conservative Maine Heritage Policy Center, said Snowe and Collins have reflected Mainers' concerns about government spending.
\
""When you look at their record on Obamacare, some of their statements on cap-and-trade, and any number of smaller votes on tax related issues, you can see that fiscal accountability in the moderate caucus and I think that's a huge shift that really reflects their concerns, which I think is the average Mainers' concern, about out-of-control government spending and debt,"" he said.
\
Christopher ""Kit"" St. John, executive director of the liberal Maine Center for Economic Policy, said he appreciates the duo's efforts to find solutions.
\
""They haven't gone along with the position of no,"" he said. ""They have decided they are going to work at making things work -- legislating -- which is what the people send them there to do. So for that, we are very grateful.""
\
L. Sandy Maisel, a Democrat and government professor at Colby College, said Snowe has become of the most respected senators in Congress.
\
""She has placed herself in the very upper echelon of senators in terms of respect with which she is held for her expertise in a number of policy areas and her work ethic,"" said Maisel.
\
Though he said he disagreed with her choice to vote against the health care law, Maisel said it highlighted her independence.
\
""Sen. Snowe clearly became very upset with the administration over the health care debate near the end and they lost her vote because of that,"" he said. ""In some ways what that shows is sort of her continuing independence.""
\
'Do it for the people'
\
What burned Snowe on health care, she says, is how Democrats used a ""ram and jam"" method to block her ideas on reform and propel policies that lacked broad political support -- like a public option for health insurance.
\
It was Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, who unveiled a version of the bill that included a public option -- a government-run health care plan.
\
Snowe, and even some Democrats, had long opposed a public option. Her approach, however, was not blanket opposition, like the rest of her Republican colleagues; she supported a compromise plan -- a fallback option, or trigger.
\
According to Snowe's proposal, the federal government would set coverage and affordability thresholds for private insurance plans. If those goals weren't met after a certain time, it would 'trigger' a public plan, with the threat of government competition driving changes in private industry, Snowe said. A similar model was employed by Medicare Part D and never triggered.
\
""I thought the trigger made good sense, and it did, but they used every mechanism to avoid it,"" she said. ""But not based on any rationale, rather it was avoiding making a concession to me as a Republican.""
\
The concessions Reid did make were aimed at swaying holdout Democrats. This included a $300 million increase in Medicaid in Louisiana (which was dubbed by pundits as the 'Louisiana purchase') for the vote of Sen. Mary Landrieu, and a permanent exemption for Nebraska of an additional state payment for a Medicaid expansion for Sen. Ben Nelson. This latter exemption, $45 million over the first 10 years, was known as the 'Cornhusker kickback.'
\
Snowe has said she wasn't interested in special treatment, but wanted to craft what she thought was a stronger piece of legislation.
\
""I feel an inordinate personal and professional responsibility to try to do everything I can to bring all my expertise and all my knowledge and thinking to the table to try to see if we can get it right,"" she said. ""But in any event, it's not always going to work out to your liking, but I do try to give it my level best.""
\
Reid eventually pulled the public option, leaving Democrats to rely on a rare procedural tactic called reconciliation to pass health care reform by simple majority, rather than the 60 votes need to block a Republican filibuster.
\
Though Snowe ultimately sided with her party on health care reform, her early support for it -- and her votes on the stimulus, jobs and financial regulation -- still has fellow Republicans saying she's just helping out President Obama.
\
Snowe contends her cause is much greater.
\
""I'm helping the country,"" she said. ""The thing is, I do it for the people I represent and for the country. And you are not always going to get what you think is entirely the best product, but you are going to do what you can that's going to achieve the ultimate result in the best interest of people. That's what it's about at the end of the day.""

96,"
Editor's Note: This story is the second of two examining the recent activity and achievements of Maine's U.S. senators during the Senate's annual recess. Last Sunday, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins was featured.
\
State House Bureau
\
For a time, during the heated Congressional clashes over health care reform, many thought the most powerful politician in Washington was not President Barack Obama, but a thin, raven-haired three-term senator from Maine.
\
""We as a party have spent the last six months, the greatest minds in our party, dwelling on the question, the unbelievably consuming question of how to get Olympia Snowe to vote on health care reform,"" thundered U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, in a noted House floor speech on Oct. 8, 2009.
\
""I want to remind us all that Olympia Snowe was not elected president last year. Olympia Snowe has no veto power in the Senate. Olympia Snowe represents a state with one half of one percent of America's population.""
\
Grayson was referring his party's frantic courtship of Sen. Olympia Snowe, the Maine Republican whose willingness to partner with Democrats on health care only seemed to deliver bipartisan anger and frustration.
\
Liberal Democrats were concerned more progressive aspects of the bill would be slashed by Senate Democratic leadership looking to cut a deal. Meanwhile, Republicans feared Snowe would blast a hole in their unified opposition.
\
Snowe had broken from the GOP on health care reform by voting for the Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill -- the only Republican on the five congressional committees of oversight that it to do so.
\
This earned her not only boos from critics, but also salt.
\
""Olympia Snowe has sold out the country,"" wrote Erick Erickson on his conservative blog, Red State. ""So we should melt her. What melts snow? Rock salt. I'm going to ship this 5 pound bag of rock salt to her office in Maine. It's only $3. You should join me. It is a visible demonstration of our contempt for her. First she votes for the stimulus. Now this.""
\
According to the Wall Street Journal, one hardware store in Indianapolis received nearly 250 mail orders for five-pound bags of rock salt from across the country, all to be delivered to Snowe's office in Portland.
\
(Snowe staffers said the salt did arrive -- and was donated to Preble Street, which provides shelter and other aid for the homeless and needy.)
\
Voting for reform should have cemented Snowe's place at the negotiating table, since at that time, Democrats were desperate for 60 Senate votes to overcome a promised Republican filibuster.
\
Spurred by repeated sentiments like Grayson's, however, Democratic leaders in the Senate abandoned the version of reform supported by Snowe for one more favored by the liberal wing of the party.
\
This left Snowe -- who endured bitterness, jealousy and contempt from inside and outside Congress while working for the bill -- feeling jettisoned by Democrats who said one thing, but really meant another.
\
In hindsight, Snowe said this process offered a new meaning of bipartisanship.
\
""(The Democratic) version of bipartisanship is my vote for their bill,"" she said in a recent interview. ""It's an either/or environment at a time in which we need to be solving these great problems.""
\
'Stay centered'
\
The push-pull nature of the health care debate was trying, Snowe said.
\
""You are in this partisan divide and as one who's straddling it, or trying to the very best I can, you just have to stay focused, don't lose your values and do what you've always done,"" she said. ""That's sort of the advice I give to myself. You just have to stay totally centered, know why you are there, for what reasons, who you represent, why you came, what you are doing and what's the problem you are trying to solve. And that's what I've done.""
\
Snowe staffers say one of the boss' favorite saying is, ""Process dictates product.""
\
""The idea is, like anything, if you do the right thing, and you build a real consensus, then you can bring people across,"" she said. ""And that just has not been (the Democrats') impetus,"" she said.
\
Despite this disenchantment, however, Snowe remains a bellwether on Capitol Hill. In addition to being the lone Republican to vote for any version of health care, she also supported the economic stimulus package, financial regulatory reform and a $26 billion state aid package.
\
Snowe and fellow Mainer U.S. Sen Susan Collins were among the few Republicans to support those bills. Snowe has voted with Republicans 67 percent of the time in this Congress, according to The Washington Post.
\
Collins has the same percentage, giving Maine's senators the lowest percentage of party-line votes in the Senate.
\
While Collins commanded the spotlight in stimulus talks, Snowe worked quietly to help shape the $787 billion measure by bringing the White House lists of spending initiatives she thought should be cut or added.
\
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, the Obama administration's envoy to Congress, said the pair have represented Maine well.
\
""They are fierce about their independence and about their pragmatism,"" he said in a recent interview. ""When they look at a piece of legislation, their first question is, 'What is the immediate impact on Maine and how does this affect Maine?' They are tough about it, they keep asking the kind of core questions that need to be asked.""
\
Election outlook
\
Their perch in the middle has created an interesting dynamic at home for Maine's senators, however.
\
Earlier this year, the Maine Republican Party made national headlines for adopting a strict, conservative party platform that supports, for example, the elimination of the federal Department of Education and the Federal Reserve.
\
Despite this, the chairman of the Maine GOP said Maine Republicans are not disappointed with Snowe and Collins' votes on the stimulus. ""No,"" said Charlie Webster. ""(But) I don't believe is the vote was held today that they would necessarily vote that way again.""
\
Webster believes the mood of the current party may influence the senators going forward, especially if Republicans have a strong showing in November's state legislative races. He defines political independence as a willingness to oppose party leadership, if that is what constituents expect.
\
""I expect that they will still be independent but I think they will be more comfortable voting in a more Republican, conservative way if they understand that people in Maine also agree with that,"" he said.
\
Snowe, however, stands by her vote. She said the economy would now be worse without the spending bill.
\
""It was mindful of small business, low income families, those that were unemployed and those who were desperate to hang onto their jobs,"" she said of the final package. ""Could we have done better? Absolutely. Could we have done it differently? Absolutely.""
\
The senators could have the chance to do things differently, if Republicans in Congress have a strong November showing. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, the minority leader in the Senate, said if Congress tilts right, the currency of centrists like Snowe and Collins would increase.
\
""Regretfully from my point of view, and I think the two Maine senators would agree with me, this administration and the majority in Congress have basically pursued pretty far left agendas,"" he said. ""I think if there is a shift in the Congress this November, the president is likely to move to the political center and you can bet that Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins will be right in the middle of negotiating agreements that will inevitably be made in the center.""
\
'Respect for the process'
\
It's in negotiating that Snowe, and Collins, have earned cross-aisle accolades from fellow senators.
\
""(Snowe) was deeply engaged throughout health reform's evolution, regularly working to ensure families and small businesses in Maine and across the country would benefit from the new law,"" said U.S. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, chair of the Senate Finance Committee. ""Sen. Snowe's tremendously hard work made the health care bill a better bill. In an increasingly toxic political environment in Washington, she only cared about one thing -- delivering for Maine.""
\
U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., said the style used by Snowe and Collins used to be more prevalent among his colleagues, but no longer.
\
""Both of them have a deep respect for process in the Senate, which makes them almost unique, not just among Republicans but amongst senators,"" he said, referring to both of Maine's senators in a recent interview. ""I don't know what it is in the water, but there is something unique about the place that produces some damn good people.""
\
In Maine, their efforts are respected, if not lauded.
\
Tarren Bragdon, chief executive of the conservative Maine Heritage Policy Center, said Snowe and Collins have reflected Mainers' concerns about government spending.
\
""When you look at their record on Obamacare, some of their statements on cap-and-trade, and any number of smaller votes on tax related issues, you can see that fiscal accountability in the moderate caucus and I think that's a huge shift that really reflects their concerns, which I think is the average Mainers' concern, about out-of-control government spending and debt,"" he said.
\
Christopher ""Kit"" St. John, executive director of the liberal Maine Center for Economic Policy, said he appreciates the duo's efforts to find solutions.
\
""They haven't gone along with the position of no,"" he said. ""They have decided they are going to work at making things work -- legislating -- which is what the people send them there to do. So for that, we are very grateful.""
\
L. Sandy Maisel, a Democrat and government professor at Colby College, said Snowe has become of the most respected senators in Congress.
\
""She has placed herself in the very upper echelon of senators in terms of respect with which she is held for her expertise in a number of policy areas and her work ethic,"" said Maisel.
\
Though he said he disagreed with her choice to vote against the health care law, Maisel said it highlighted her independence.
\
""Sen. Snowe clearly became very upset with the administration over the health care debate near the end and they lost her vote because of that,"" he said. ""In some ways what that shows is sort of her continuing independence.""
\
'Do it for the people'
\
What burned Snowe on health care, she says, is how Democrats used a ""ram and jam"" method to block her ideas on reform and propel policies that lacked broad political support -- like a public option for health insurance.
\
It was Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, who unveiled a version of the bill that included a public option -- a government-run health care plan.
\
Snowe, and even some Democrats, had long opposed a public option. Her approach, however, was not blanket opposition, like the rest of her Republican colleagues; she supported a compromise plan -- a fallback option, or trigger.
\
According to Snowe's proposal, the federal government would set coverage and affordability thresholds for private insurance plans. If those goals weren't met after a certain time, it would 'trigger' a public plan, with the threat of government competition driving changes in private industry, Snowe said. A similar model was employed by Medicare Part D and never triggered.
\
""I thought the trigger made good sense, and it did, but they used every mechanism to avoid it,"" she said. ""But not based on any rationale, rather it was avoiding making a concession to me as a Republican.""
\
The concessions Reid did make were aimed at swaying holdout Democrats. This included a $300 million increase in Medicaid in Louisiana (which was dubbed by pundits as the 'Louisiana purchase') for the vote of Sen. Mary Landrieu, and a permanent exemption for Nebraska of an additional state payment for a Medicaid expansion for Sen. Ben Nelson. This latter exemption, $45 million over the first 10 years, was known as the 'Cornhusker kickback.'
\
Snowe has said she wasn't interested in special treatment, but wanted to craft what she thought was a stronger piece of legislation.
\
""I feel an inordinate personal and professional responsibility to try to do everything I can to bring all my expertise and all my knowledge and thinking to the table to try to see if we can get it right,"" she said. ""But in any event, it's not always going to work out to your liking, but I do try to give it my level best.""
\
Reid eventually pulled the public option, leaving Democrats to rely on a rare procedural tactic called reconciliation to pass health care reform by simple majority, rather than the 60 votes need to block a Republican filibuster.
\
Though Snowe ultimately sided with her party on health care reform, her early support for it -- and her votes on the stimulus, jobs and financial regulation -- still has fellow Republicans saying she's just helping out President Obama.
\
Snowe contends her cause is much greater.
\
""I'm helping the country,"" she said. ""The thing is, I do it for the people I represent and for the country. And you are not always going to get what you think is entirely the best product, but you are going to do what you can that's going to achieve the ultimate result in the best interest of people. That's what it's about at the end of the day.""

97,"Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting\As much as any place in liberal Portland, it is a gathering spot for a city whose voters have no use for Gov. Paul LePage. Only 19 percent of Portland voters went for LePage in the 2010 election - there was no place he did worse.\This summer, Dave Dearborn was sitting at a table in the high-ceilinged cafe reading a book and nursing a coffee. Now, more than two years into the Republican's tenure, what did he think of the governor?\'He outright embarrasses us with the idiotic things he says,' Dearborn said.\He said that after he finished his coffee, he was going up to the headquarters of a different candidate for governor, Eliot Cutler.\Cutler is the independent and former Democrat who came in a close second to LePage and is hoping to do better in 2014. But he will be competing with a well-known Democrat, U. S. Rep. Mike Michaud, and LePage to be the governor.\Dearborn said LePage 'plays on people's ignorance. He has a bombastic approach to politics that appeals to people who are willfully ignorant.'\About 90 miles away sits a Maine town where LePage's brand of politics went over better than it did in any other community of any size in the state.\In Albion, a rural town in central Maine, LePage won by a landslide, with some to spare. He got nearly 61 percent of the vote from this town of 2,000.\Locals there get their morning coffee at the Albion Corner Store at 14 Main St., where you can also all fill up your pickup and grab a slice and a Pepsi.\At lunchtime in August, men in jeans and tee-shirts and some wearing fluorescent safety vests hurried in, joked with the women behind the lunch counter, ordered something 'to go' and headed back to the job site.\One of them was Brent Dow, 35, owner of a metal roofing company with four employees.\'He's kind of like me,' Dow said, 'He jokes a lot. He makes a lot of comments, but he stands by them. And some of them I agree with.'\What matters more to him, he said, was that LePage 'thinks like a worker ... he's more for the working person than a person who has a state job or who found a way to stay on state benefits ... He seems to go after those people.'\Parris Varney, who owns the store with his wife Kathy, echoed Dow's assessment of the governor.\'To me, he's not a typical politician. He's a little rough around the edges, but he says what other people think, but they don't say it,' he said. 'He's a regular guy.'\The customers in Crema and the Albion Corner Store may be miles apart in their views, but they have something in common: They are representative of the public debate over the governor.\Whether you are interviewing folks at coffee shops, reading letters to the editor and online comments or news coverage, most of the LePage debate has been about the sizzle, not the steak. About what he says and how he says it, not what he's done and not done.\The Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting has interviewed LePage three times and more than two dozen others - from voters to political insiders to LePage's friends and enemies - to develop a fuller picture of the state's 74th governor.\What emerged was the story of the man behind the headlines, headlines that reflect one side -- but one side only -- of the state's chief executive.\The picture also includes the stubborn former business consultant who has made foundational changes in the state's fiscal status; the populist who reflects the pent-up frustration of working people with what they see as Maine's profligate spending; the easily-frustrated CEO with little patience for the slow grind of the legislative process.\And perhaps most telling: the anti-politician with his disdain for the sometime necessary tact required of political leaders, whose attitude may well be getting in the way of fulfilling more of his agenda.\'I'm a lightning rod,' LePage said in one of the interviews. He attracts -- perhaps even courts - extreme reactions. He's been called everything from a bully to a moron by his detractors, while those closest to him see a personable, self-deprecating man who reads every bill, study and document on his desk.\The middle ground on Paul LePage is a slim sandbar in the torrent of opinions, but among those few who stand there is Jill Goldthwait, a former independent state senator from Bar Harbor.\'I'm sure that I don't know any others (politicians) that are as fearless about political fallout' from their comments and positions as LePage, she said. His 'single-mindedness has served him well,' she said, but when his comments turn crude 'it interferes with his ability to accomplish his agenda.'\To Tony Payne, a self-described fiscal conservative and the one-time head of the Alliance for Maine's Future, a pro-business group, LePage 'has moved the dial on policy more than anyone in my lifetime, as no governor has, on more fronts - simultaneously.'\Karen Heck, who succeeded LePage as mayor of Waterville, represents those disgusted with him. She said the governor's well-publicized comments show a lack of self-control that damages the state's image to potential new businesses - his supposed calling card.\Citing what she called LePage's 'toxic' childhood, Heck said, 'He's a scared little boy who wishes his mother could have protected him and his father loved him' and learned to survive by being 'the biggest, baddest person around.'\LePage, though, doesn't see himself that way.\'People think I'm a bully, but it's just that I get a little offended when they get condescending.' That's when, he said, 'I get a little condescending to them.'\With the exception of his hardcore followers, there is little support for his most extreme remarks, from declaring that the president of the United States could 'go to hell' to going on TV to say that a legislator who opposed his budget was 'the first one to give it to the people of Maine without providing Vaseline.'\People who spend time with him say there is another LePage the public would be surprised to see: studious, respectful - but always to the point.\Emily Cain is the current Democratic state senator from Orono who was House minority leader during LePage first two years in office. She worked closely with LePage on ethics reform and domestic violence legislation.\In her meetings with the governor, Cain said, 'He's usually very focused and determined. The governor has never been a bully to me and, quite frankly, I would not have stood for it.'\In two sit-down interviews and one car trip from Augusta to Portland and back - a total of about six hours - the LePage of the screaming headlines showed up only once. But the one time offers an explanation for all the other outbursts:\Replying to a question about working with legislators, he said: 'I hate politics,' his voice rising, the 'hate' coming out in bold, all caps. 'I just hate having to compromise my principles.'\Chapter 1: The Correction\For most of the past 30 years, Maine voters were pretty clear what they wanted in the Statehouse - Democrats, or independents with a liberal bent.\Then why did a Tea Party-favorite like LePage get more votes in the last governor's race than a stalwart Democrat like Libby Mitchell or a classic good-government independent like Cutler?\Severin Beliveau -- the ultimate stalwart Democrat -- had an answer: LePage's 38 percent win in the five-way race was an antidote to decades of progressive politics.\'People's sense was we needed a correction,' said Beliveau, a partner in one of the state's leading law firms, PretiFlaherty, whose party bona fides are as long and as impressive as his success as a lobbyist.\'He was conveying a message that was well-received' in 2010, when voters went for not only a conservative candidate for governor but elected a Republican House and Senate.\The rough-and-tough image LePage projected in the campaign was no creation of slick campaign advisers. He grew up on the streets of gritty Lewiston; ran Marden's, a statewide discount chain, so he knew how to make a good deal; and was mayor of Waterville, where voters liked his fiscal management. He promised to cut spending, lower taxes, pay off the state's debt and end Maine's reputation as a welfare state.\LePage, Beliveau said, 'expressed the frustration of many Americans ... the fact that we're still in a recession and had more than a dozen years of Democratic control. I think many people believed there should be a correction.'\Alan Caron is founder of GrowSmart Maine, the group responsible for the widely respected landmark study of the state by the Brookings Institution, called Charting Maine's Future. The Waterville native is a political independent and former Democrat who holds a masters degree in public policy from Harvard.\The election of LePage, he said, represented 'an eruption ready to happen.'\'He perfectly expresses the ... fiscal frustration that Maine people had for a long time, bubbling under the surface, sometimes breaking through,' said Caron, now a business consultant.\'The Democrats have been and were largely tone deaf to that for a long time,' he said, leaving an opening for a champion of the smaller government who came on 'with strong opinions and a loud voice.'\Garrett Martin, the executive director of the progressive think tank and lobbying group Maine Center for Economic Policy (MECEP), said LePage is exploiting - not truly expressing -- the frustrations of the working and middle classes.\'The LePages of the world have tapped into ... the vein of discontent with 'The look-over-there-thing.' Look over there - that guy's getting a better deal and he's not working nearly as hard as you and those are guys we need to go after,' Martin said. 'He's brilliant at tapping into that discontent.'\That approach, Martin added, 'distracts attention away from the fact that his policies are actually hurting people who are struggling to get by, many of whom likely voted for him in 2010.'\To Martin, LePage has harmed working people by, until recently, refusing to bond for projects that would create jobs and by opposing Medicaid expansion.\Chapter 2: The House of the Fiscally Sound\Google the name 'Paul LePage' and the phrase 'fiscal house in order' and you get more than 55,000 hits. Putting that house back in order was a major theme of his campaign.\When Democratic Gov. John Baldacci moved out of the Blaine House and LePage moved in, there were two potentially crushing liabilities on the state's balance sheet: multi-million-dollar debts to the state's pension system and to hospitals for late Medicaid payments.\LePage is known mostly as the former general manager of Marden's string of discount stores, but before that he was a 'turn-around' specialist - the MBA you hire when your business is on the ropes, often due to too much debt, overspending and inefficiencies.\One of LePage's oldest friends and golf buddies is Alan Rancourt, the president of Kennebec Federal Savings in Waterville, who recalled LePage's days as an executive at the now-defunct Scott Paper plant in Winslow and as a gun-for-hire business consultant.\He said when LePage came into those jobs the first thing he did was 'get the invoices ... you paid the people who supplied the lumber because if you don't pay them, then the whole process goes away.'\The 'invoices' on his desk when LePage was inaugurated on Jan. 5, 2011 included $4.4 billion in debt to the pension system because the state had underpaid into the system for years and pension investments took a hit from the recession.\Unless something was done about the debt, it would soon go from eating up 10 percent of the state budget to 20 percent, a calculation based on pension records and budget projections.\In early 2010, Caron, citing the Brookings report, said the pension debt was 'a ticking time bomb that the next governor will inherit. There isn't going to be enough money to do what we're already committed to doing, much less doing more of what we should be doing.'\During the campaign, both LePage and Cutler vowed to deal with the debt if they won; the Democratic nominee, Libby Mitchell, did not make the pension debt an issue and believed future investment returns would solve the problem - a view the Democratic-appointed head of the pension board did not endorse.\Reducing the pension debt was one of LePage's early achievements - although he didn't do it alone. He initiated a plan, but it was modified by the Legislature's appropriations committee. The debt reduction came from the wallets of current and future retirees whose future pensions will be limited by a severe cutback in their cost of living provisions. (Pensioners will be eligible for cost of living increases in the future if the state has a budget surplus.)\In all the years the debt was building, the lone voice calling attention to the looming budget crisis was Republican Peter Mills, a longtime member of the Legislature.\Mills, who lost to LePage in the 2010 primary, considers the pension legislation the governor's 'single biggest achievement,' an opinion echoed by many of the those interviewed for this story.\'That dropped $1.7 billion off the pension liability,' said Mills, currently the head of the Maine Turnpike Authority. 'If he had not been elected governor and the Republicans had not taken power in 2010, it's safe to say that would not have happened.'\Caron said the pension debt 'was going to bankrupt the state if we didn't so something about it.'\LePage himself puts the pension bill second on his list of achievements - 'Paying the hospital debt was the most important ... that was the hardest one.'\That $183.5 million debt for underpaying Medicare bills from the hospitals had been building for at least 10 years when Democrats controlled the Statehouse. Caron and others have said the state used the hospital's money as a 'credit card' rather than make cuts from the state budget to pay the debt.\'We were skating,' he said, 'spending money we didn't have.'\The state auditor, Pola Buckley, a CPA who was appointed by the Democratic Legislature, noted just last December that the hospital debt is the 'largest cause' that 'adversely affect(s)' the state's balance sheet.\The legislation proposed by LePage and - after a long fight by the Democrats - approved by the Legislature is designed to take that red ink off the state's balance sheet. It will also free up $300 million in federal matching funds - putting a total almost a half-billion dollars into the state's economy.\Paying for the hospital debt fixes two problems LePage inherited. One was the debt itself. The other was a decision by the Baldacci administration to fix a budget shortfall by selling the state's liquor business at what a study showed was a low-ball price of $125 million.\LePage proposed -- and the Legislature agreed -- to pay for the hospital debt with the increased revenue from a renegotiated sale of the liquor business.\Democrats also tried to link paying the hospital debt to expanding Medicaid, the state-federal health care program for the poor.\LePage vetoed that bill, claiming broadening Medicaid would amount to a 'massive increase in welfare expansion' and there was no guarantee the federal government would pick up the costs over the next decade.\That, said Mills and others, was a blow to not just those who would be served by the expansion, but also to the state's economy.\'There's more money tied up in that than the hospital (debt). Over three years, the amount of money they would have gotten in the federal expansion was $930 million over three calendar years.'\Mills said one of LePage's political heroes, Ronald Reagan -- there's a large portrait of the 40th president hanging in LePage's office -- would not have let his conservative philosophy 'get in the way of some money.'\Mark Eves, the Democratic speaker of the House, said LePage's position on Medicaid showed that often he has been 'just immovable and in a very reckless way.'\LePage sees his confrontations with the Legislature differently: 'The only reason we got anything done is we embarrassed some people into doing stuff. This place is a nicey-nicey club. Go-along to get-along, and then we'll be friends ... The little bit I got done is because I forced it. If I was nicey-nice, I would have got nothing done. I'd have gone to a lot of golf tournaments and cut a lot of ribbons.'\Chapter 3: Jobs, red tape and the environment\The polls say it. And the pols say it. There's nothing more important - at least in this economy -- than jobs.\So candidates promise to create more jobs -- even though economists say job creation is a lot more complicated in this global economy than the people running for office want to admit.\LePage made jobs promises - but he avoided saying he would directly create jobs.\Instead, he took the traditional conservative's approach - get government out of the way and the jobs will come.\'We know how more jobs are created. Entrepreneurs and small businesses are the backbone of job creation, ' he states in his campaign white paper.\While no one in the state is more identified as a Democrat than Beliveau, he is also a real estate investor himself and PretiFlaherty is one of the go-to firms for local and out-of-state businesses that deal with state agencies. (Ann Robinson, a partner in the firm, was co-chair of the LePage transition team and has advised LePage. She is a Republican.)\To Beliveau, LePage has lived up to his promise to make Maine more 'business-friendly,' the key to job creation - according to one side of the debate.\'I have to admit there's been an almost dramatic change in the attitude in the state agencies in their response to inquiries,' said Beliveau, who is backing Michaud against LePage and Cutler. 'They've become more respectful, more helpful, willing to find a way to solve a problem rather than create obstacles.'\Dana Connors, the president of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, cites specifics in praising LePage's policies, such as approval of a bill that 'opens the door to mining,' the governor's veto of a worker's compensation bill the Chamber said would have added millions to premiums and his veto of a hike in a minimum wage.\Connors said LePage 'has been pretty spot on in terms of staying true to doing what he set out to do.' But there was a qualifier to his support - while his members like the governor's policies, 'where you find the falling out,' Connors said, 'are over his comments ... It's the style and not the policy that has people scratching their heads.'\One of the state's leading environmentalists said LePage's policies are bad for jobs and the economy because that economy depends in a large degree on the state's 'brand identity.'\Pete Didisheim, the longtime lead lobbyist for the Natural Resources Council of Maine (NRCM), said, 'Our sense is the environment is nowhere on his radar screen ... underlying that is a lack of understanding of the importance of Maine's natural resources to all aspects of the state's economy,' including attracting new businesses.\While environmental groups like NRCM had easy access to the governor's office going back at least to Baldacci and Angus King, Didisheim has never met with LePage.\He said LePage 'came in with a sharply hostile attitude towards the state agencies involved in implementing Maine's environmental laws that marked him in our eyes and the eyes of many as the most anti-environmental governor ever.'\He cites many examples, from the Portland Press Herald's series accusing LePage's head of the Department of Environmental Protection of favoritism towards business to trying to take authority over development in the north woods away from a state-appointed agency known as LURC.\'That would have been the end of the north woods as we know it,' Didisheim said.\(LePage eventually signed a bill reforming LURC based on a bipartisan study.)\As a candidate, LePage struck a chord with business people with his promise to reduce red tape so they can expand and add jobs. LD1 was one of LePage's first initiatives and was crafted by advisor, corporate lobbyist and Preti Flaherty partner Robinson. The legislation proposed rolling back some of Maine's pioneering laws that limited the public's exposure to toxic chemicals, including the chemical BPA, abolishing the state Board of Environmental Protection (BEP) and other steps.\It was greeted with outrage by the state's environmentalists.\""This list is reckless and appalling. It puts our health at risk, it puts our environment at risk, our clean air, our clean drinking water at risk,"" said Maureen Drouin, executive director of the Maine League of Conservation Voters.\The bill that LePage ultimately signed was dramatically scaled back by lawmakers, but still streamlined permitting processes, cut the number of members on the BEP, established environmental self-auditing programs for businesses and instituted business assistance programs at the state's economic development department.\Many of its most controversial environmental proposals were split off from the original bill and sent to legislative committees for further review.\Beliveau sees LePage's attitude towards the traditional liberal interests groups as a refreshing change.\'I think this is the first governor in ages that is not indebted to the MSEA, NRCM and MEA,' he said referring to the state employees' union, the environmental advocacy group and the teachers' union. Both unions are major contributors to Democratic candidates.\LePage, Beliveau said, 'has succeeded by challenging them, confronting them and in many ways provided balance where it had not existed earlier.'\His firm represented Plum Creek Development when it applied during the Baldacci administration for LURC permits to develop around Moosehead Lake. If LePage had been governor, Beliveau speculated, it would not have taken three years 'and millions and millions in counsel fees, expert witnesses ... and a whole slug of experts we had to pay.'\The plan was eventually approved with modifications, 'but it was torturous,' he said.\And to those who say agencies like the DEP have become less environmentally sensitive and more business-oriented, the 75-year-old Beliveau had the classic response of a veteran political hand: 'Elections have consequences.'\The idea that LePage has put good business practices into place in state government grates on Cutler, an attorney, a former budget official in the Carter administration and an international business consultant.\While Cutler cited some areas where LePage has succeeded -- pension reform, charter school legislation, questioning state spending - he said the governor's style 'is a slap in the face to most responsible business leaders.'\'I've put good practices in place in government ... It's hard work and it's collaborative,' Cutler said. To succeed, it needs to be 'a shared enterprise and have a common sense of purpose. And we don't have that in Maine today.'\When it comes to measuring LePage's track record on jobs and the economy, there is also empirical data, such as the employment rate.\Two-and-a-half years into LePage's four-year term, Maine's unemployment rate stood at 6.9 percent and the U.S. rate at 7.4.\During that period, the Maine rate dropped 1.1 percentage points, or about 14 percent. That's not as good as the national drop of 1.7 points or almost 19 percent. But in July, the US rate had gotten a bit worse and the state's rate a little better.\The Maine unemployment rate has been better than the U.S. rate throughout LePage's term; but it was worse than the U.S. during parts of Baldacci's two terms.\Another widely-cited statistic is the percentage of the population with jobs. Here, Maine does better: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national rate has ticked up just three-tenths of a point while the state has gone up nearly a whole point since LePage became governor.\The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank produces a monthly report called the State Coincident Index that takes into account four economic indicators: non-farm employment; average hours worked in manufacturing; the unemployment rate; and wage and salary disbursements.\Until the recession, Maine had been doing better than the U.S. on this measure, but then Maine slipped deeper and faster than the nation. Both started to turn around about the time LePage took office, with the US numbers going up 9.4 percent and the state's 4.1 percent in the last 2.5 years.\But the Philadelphia Fed sees a rosier picture ahead for Maine - it is one of only 17 states projected to grow faster than the nation over the next six months.\When it comes to job creation, The Business Journals said Maine ranked 43 of 45 states measured as of May, adding private jobs at about half the national average over 12 months. A report by the Pew Center said Maine added about 200 private jobs from April 2012 to April 2013.\In September, Forbes magazine -- for the fourth year in a row -- ranked Maine the worst state in the nation for business expansion, the driver of private job creation.\'Not much has changed,' Forbes said. Maine 'is still burdened with an aging population and a weak economic forecast. Job growth projections are the worst in the U.S ...'\LePage responded by saying the ranking is a legacy of the years of Democratic rule. Glenn Mills, chief economist at the Maine Department of Labor's Center for Workforce Research and Information, told the Bangor Daily News that 'many of the reasons for Maine's poor ranking by Forbes can be traced to its aging population, which affects everything from the available labor pool to wages.'\What do all the statistics mean?\'We are growing, but not as fast as we would like.'\That's the assessment of James Clair. Clair is the chairman of the state's Consensus Economic Forecasting Commission, the CEO of Goold Health Care Systems and a former non-partisan staffer to the Legislature's Appropriations Committee. He holds a master's degree in public administration from Syracuse University.\One area he sees 'getting pretty strong' is personal income. Last year, Maine's 3.4 percent growth in personal income was the slowest rate of any state and far below the national average of 5.1 percent. But the more up-to-date report by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis tells a better story for Maine. While all but one state showed declines in personal income growth, Maine's decline was among the smallest, ranking better than 31 other states.\Bottom line for Clair: 'We're having some growth, but it could be better.'\Chapter 4: Taxes -- Been Up So Long ...\The left, the right and just about everyone in-between has long agreed on one thing about Maine's taxes -- the income tax had to be fixed.\The main problem with it was that it treated working people like they were rich. The top 8.5 percent tax rate kicked in at an income level of $19,500.\In 2008, the Tax Foundation said Maine's 8.5 percent was the seventh-highest state income tax top rate in the country. It wasn't long after that that Democrats, who had control of the Legislature and governor's office, came up with a plan to lower the income tax rate.\Championed by Democratic state Rep. John Piotti, it called for a flat tax rate of 6.5 percent but a broadening of the sales tax to make up for the lost income tax revenue. Politically, Democrats would not support a plan that reduced state revenues and required cuts in spending.\It passed the Legislature and was signed into law by Baldacci, but voters killed the plan in a June 2010 referendum, its failure widely attributed to the sales tax hikes and to Gov. John Baldacci's changes to the bill exempting some favored businesses, such as real estate and skiing, from the new sales tax.\State Sen. Joe Perry, D-Bangor, told AP the vote marked 40 years of failed attempts to reform Maine's taxes, putting Maine at a competitive disadvantage with other states.\Then came another vote just five months later -- the election of LePage, who in the recent interviews with the Center described his political philosophy: 'I don't define myself as a Republican. I define myself as a conservative, as someone who believes in self-reliance, smaller government - and only enough taxes to run the show.'\Now, the income tax problem was back on the table - and the timing was perfect. The Tea Party movement, founded on a visceral dislike of deficits and high taxes, scored successes on the national and state stage, including Maine.\LePage proposed what he hoped would be the first step in lowing taxes: take the top rate down from 8.5 percent to 7.95 percent. That became part of the governor's first budget, and it was approved with votes from both parties.\His claim that it was the largest tax cut in Maine history, at $400 million, has not been refuted.\What did it do to Mainers' taxes? Here are some projections for 2014 from the Maine Revenue Service:\* The biggest change in taxes on a percentage basis goes to the working poor - a reduction in their income taxes of 83.6 percent. That group is counted as 19,503 'tax families.'\* The biggest change in taxes on a dollar basis goes to the tax families making $325,974 and above. Their taxes will down $3,021 per family. There are 6,643 families in this group.\* A broader view comes by looking at the middle - those making from about $33,000 to roughly $87,000, about 40 percent of all taxpayers. Their taxes go down about 8.6 percent. On an annual basis, this group's average savings is about $220.\Interpretations of the new tax have been a projective test of where you stand on the ideological spectrum. Those that call it a giveaway to the wealthy tend to be left-leaning Democrats and progressives. The ones who see it as overdue include the business establishment and the long-frustrated fiscal conservatives, mostly Republicans.\'Fiscally irresponsible ... that primarily benefits Maine's wealthiest taxpayers,' claimed a white paper from the Maine Center for Economic Policy.\From the Maine Wire, the 'news service' of the conservative Maine Heritage Policy Center: 'These tax cuts benefit all Mainers by putting more money in the pockets of hardworking people and stimulating economic activity, which in turn creates jobs.'\Caron, one of the most cited centrists in the state, points out that the Brookings report found that the state's high income tax was a major impediment to growth.\The LePage tax cut, he said, was 'an important goal,' but he questions the way it was done because there was no way to pay for the $230 million cost of the first two years of the tax cut.\Instead, he said, LePage's next budget made up for that loss with cuts in the money the state would give back to cities and towns - known as revenue sharing. Even though the Legislature restored some of those cuts, the reduction is translating into higher tax rates in some cities and towns, although it is too early in the tax cycle to have precise data.\LePage has mixed feelings when he reflects on the tax cut.\On the one hand, he boasts that 70,000 people no longer pay taxes and that 450,000 of 630,000 Mainers got a tax reduction. On the other, he said, 'We were better off not lowering at all compared to what we're doing now.'\The 'now' is the budget the Legislature approved -- over his veto -- that temporarily raises the sales tax rate and taxes on meals and lodging.\One reason legislators increased taxes was to make up for the millions they added back to revenue sharing. Opponents to the LePage-sized cuts predicted those cuts would cause local taxes to rise. If that happened - and it has in some communities - it could hurt legislators' chances for reelection in 2014.\LePage doesn't buy the argument that cities and towns had to raise taxes to make up for the loss in revenue sharing. Instead, he said they should do what he did with some success as mayor of Waterville - consolidate.\'Take a look at Lewiston,' he said. 'Thirty-six thousand people. They have one town manager, one police chief, one fire chief, one public works director, one superintendent (of schools), one tax assessor. Then you go back to Waterville, Winslow, Fairfield and Oakland,' he said, slapping his hand on the dining room table with the name of each town. 'Four communities and they have roughly 36,000, maybe 37,000, people and they have 24 administrators. Lewiston has six - that's the problem with revenue sharing.'\(Fact-checking his claim is complicated by the fact that local staffs have a variety of titles, some are part-time, some have mid-level officials, etc. But supporting the thrust of LePage's view is the Brookings study, which cited the need to consolidate local services.)\Payne, the former head of a business group and formerly a town councilor in Falmouth, is a fiscal conservative, but the revenue sharing reduction 'was not a particularly wise choice.'\'I'm not convinced the towns have a lot of fat,' but he said that may not be the case 'on the schools' side.'\Mills, the former legislator and a student of the state's finances, said LePage may have missed an even better opportunity to fix the state's tax system when he rejected working with an ad hoc bipartisan committee that came up with a fresh tax reform plan this year.\The group was led by independent state Sen. Dick Woodbury of Yarmouth - as Mills points out, a Harvard-educated economist.\There were obstacles, Mills said, such as the plan's expansion of the sales tax, but it would also have eliminated many of the business tax breaks that economists say are ineffective, while reducing the income tax far more than LePage's bill did.\'If he had got behind it, it would have picked up intense credibility,' Mills said. 'And if he had gotten it through, it would have reduced the Maine income tax to four percent or thereabouts.\'It's what economists have been telling us to do for decades - reduce the income tax and broaden the sale tax base,' Mills said. 'It's just what Reagan did with the income tax in 1986 ... got rid of the gimmicks.'\But LePage rejected the bipartisan proposal because of the sales tax increases, even though they are offset by decreases elsewhere.\Instead, he has said he wants to eliminate the income tax all together by the end of his second term - if he gets one.\LePage was having lunch in the Blaine House when the legislators - including Republicans -- overrode his veto of their budget.\His reaction was resignation, not anger. And a bit of his signature sarcasm: 'It's too bad because we simply don't want to get out of 50th place - and I just hope Puerto Rico doesn't want to become a state,' he said, and then laughed. 'Because they are doing much better.'\Chapter 5: Enter Stage Right\'As your governor, you're going to be seeing a lot of me on the front page ...'\You don't need a fact-check on that one. From his admitted 'big mouth' to his attacks on the legacy policies of Democratic rule, LePage seems to be on page one every day.\For 16 years, Maine's governors - Baldacci and King - stood slightly to the left-of-middle on most issues and rarely made news with off-hand commentaries.\Baldacci, the Democrat, is a lifetime politician, with that hale-fellow- well-met personality that suited his profession. King, now a U. S. senator, is officially an independent, but caucuses with the Democrats. He is as charming as a Reagan, speaks as well as a network anchorman and comes dressed in L.L. Bean khaki.\Three years ago, voters changed direction and along came LePage, the linebacker-shaped former homeless Franco from Lewiston who does not turn his nose up at the tea party.\As longtime friend and Waterville car dealer Charlie Gaunce said of LePage: 'I'd rather have a fighter in there than a marshmallow ... he's not a great orator. We don't need that.'\From education to energy, welfare to health care, the governor's proposals have shaken up Augusta - which is one reason he makes the news almost every day.\In the past, the theme that ran through many of the policies from governors and the Legislature might be best summed up in a favorite term from their tenures: 'protect our most vulnerable citizens.'\While conservatives like LePage say they also want to protect the needy, they put a greater emphasis on responsibility and accountability, which showed up in proposals such as letter grades for public schools. Based on standardized tests and other criteria, schools are graded A-F by LePage's Department of Education.\He saw it as a way to get attention to what he has said is a core problem in the state's economy - Maine's public schools are serving administrators and teacher unions well, but not teachers and students. If parents hold schools accountable for a poor grade, 'the schools improve,' he said.\It will take some time to know if he is right, but school officials, education groups, Democrats and editorials railed again the program, using terms like 'labeling' 'threatening,' 'shameful,' 'faulty' and 'uncompassionate.'\But grading schools isn't just a conservative fad: About four months after LePage's grading system was announced, another political figure - President Barack Obama -- proposed grading the country's colleges to help parents and students know if the money they spent produced good results.\LePage said one of the two biggest disappointments so far was his failure to pass another education accountability bill.\The Legislature's education committee unanimously rejected LD 1524. The bill would have required public colleges to track the number of remedial courses needed by incoming high school students in math and language arts.\LePage has said, for example, that 54 percent of the students going into community colleges need such help (a statistic that has been confirmed by the college system). The originating high schools would have to pay for those remedial classes if LePage's bill had passed.\'Our education is not a bad education,' he said. 'We just haven't ticked up and everyone else has.'\That assessment seems to have been confirmed by an expert interviewed by the Bangor Daily News July 27 last year after a Harvard study ranked Maine public schools next to last for rate of improvement of the 41 participating states.\Paul Peterson, professor of government at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, said, 'Maine is one of those states that hasn't shown much gain over' the last 20 years.\Democrats and advocacy groups never denied that Maine's schools needed to be better, but their ideas vs. LePage's tell the bigger story of how each side sees the role of government.\Democrats proposed legislation to give more aid and encouragement to schools doing poorly, rather than calling then out.\LePage and his supporters don't mind if some of those on the public payroll feel insulted.\'It's all about accountability,' LePage said.\To conservatives like LePage, accountability goes hand-in-hand with personal responsibility. His legislation, for example, to put a lifetime cap of five years on Temporary Aid to Needy families (TANF), fulfilled a campaign promise to limit welfare.\Other welfare changes included drug testing for welfare recipients already convicted of drug offenses and denying TANF and food stamp benefits to immigrants who were legal residents. Maine was among only a handful of states to provide substantial benefits to legal resident immigrants.\According to the LePage administration, the limits resulted in a 41 percent decrease in TANF benefits between the bill's enactment and now.\But that decrease hasn't meant demand for help has disappeared. The state's cities and towns say LePage's reforms simply shifted the cost of public assistance to them and they're now bearing the burden of helping out poor families through General Assistance, which is funded in part by local taxpayers.\LePage considers his second failure to be another welfare change he wanted - but didn't get.\LePage - with support from a handful of members of both parties - wanted the state to get federal permission to ban the use of food stamps to buy soft drinks and snack food.\The bill, LD 1411, was killed - and in the process more was revealed about the fundamental differences between LePage and prevailing liberal sentiment in the Legislature. While he wanted to require more nutritious food purchases by people on public assistance, the Senate Democrats wanted to teach people to eat healthier - but not require anything.\That would avoid stigmatizing the state's poor residents, said Sen. Margaret Craven, D-Lewiston, according to the Bangor Daily News.\'Treating people who are poor differently, I think, undermines their humanity and undermines our humanity for treating them that way,' she said.\The loss seemed to pain LePage.\'Losing that nutrition thing was a heartbreak,' he said. 'We failed.'\Two staff members present for the interview interrupted and said the failure wasn't his - it was the Legislature's.\'No,' he shot back at them. 'My administration failed. This is where the buck stops.'\Chapter 6: Power to the people\'Maine's energy costs are too high - and it's killing economic opportunity.' - Gov. LePage, 2013 state of the state address\The high cost of energy in Maine has been one of the most consistent themes from the governor - and one of the hardest to do much about, so far.\When LePage came into office, the overall cost of electricity in the state was 31 percent above the national average, according to federal statistics quoted by the LePage administration. Two years into the LePage administration, things had improved a bit - the state was 24 percent above the national average and 12th highest in the country.\The improvement was due to a decrease in the price of natural gas in New England, from which electricity prices are set.\'We were lucky,' admitted Patrick Woodcock, the head of the LePage energy office.\But luck will only get you so far, and Woodcock said those prices are starting to tick up.\LePage's approach to more permanent solutions reveals -- once again -- his philosophical differences with the once-prevalent thinking in state government.\Democrats have generally come at the energy issue from a policy angle, stressing the environment. Thus, Gov. John Baldacci's efforts to make Maine a major producer of wind power, a strategy that is still being debated.\LePage comes at it from the point of view of the consumer, the family spending too much to heat their home and the businessman who pays more for electricity than competitors.\He has been a cheerleader for the expansion of natural gas in Maine, including converting many state buildings to the cheaper fuel. And much of Greater Augusta is being torn up right now to lay gas pipelines to business and homes.\Woodcock said LePage's early support of natural gas 'was controversial at the time. The inherent market was oil and those businesses were really opposed to the initiative.'\Woodcock credits LePage's appointments to the Public Utilities Commission for making a change in regulations that includes a $1,200 rebate to convert a home to natural gas use. 'That's been driving this growth,' Woodcock said.\He cites another innovation by LePage that will help homeowners deal with the cost of keeping their homes warm that required the governor to modify his conservative opposition to the cap-and-trade plan known as RGGI.\Now, about $9 million of the $40 million RGGI funds will go to the Efficiency Maine Trust, a quasi-state agency, to help homeowners modernize their heating systems.\Steve Ward is the former state public advocate, a position created to represent consumers before the Public Utilities Commission (he held the position for 20 years) and is currently chair of the Maine Center for Economic Policy, a progressive think thank and advocacy group based in Augusta.\He said, 'If the LePage administration played any important role in stimulating the second round of gas infrastructure build-out that we are now witnessing, they had a great deal of company: big paper companies and their lawyers, entrepreneurial gas developers like Summit and many (but not all) environmental organizations in Maine.'\Woodcock agreed that business interests played a major role.\Ward supports the new use of the RGGI funds because they will be used 'for converting obsolete and dangerous furnaces in low-income homes to cheaper and cleaner fuels ...'\But he added that the RGGI money was part of the omnibus energy bill that LePage vetoed (the veto was overridden). 'The most positive achievement' of the Act, Ward said, was to give authority over funding for the Efficiency Maine's programs to the professionals at the PUC and not the Legislature, where it is subject to 'political maneuvering.'\The chief reason for LePage's opposition to the bill was that it did not scale back the state's ambitious wind power goals, which, he has said, give wind an unfair advantage over other forms of energy. At one point, he said he would support the Act if the Legislature gave him what he wanted about an offshore wind project.\The PUC had approved a $120 million deal with Statoil of Norway to test large scale floating wind turbines off Boothbay. LePage thought the deal was bad for consumers because it would pay the company above-market rates for the power and also because he wanted the University of Maine to be allowed to bid - well after the bids had been closed.\In the end, LePage vetoed the energy bill but got his way with the offshore wind contract and the UMaine wind project will now be considered by the PUC.\Critics claim forcing the PUC to go back on the Statoil agreement was not 'business-friendly' - one of LePage's go-to themes.\LePage admitted in the May interview, 'We're trying to get Statoil out ... they're a Norwegian company that comes to Maine, they get a contract to go deep offshore, deep water windmills, with no guarantees of creating jobs in Maine, no guarantees of anything. If it works we'll create jobs, is what they said. We've had the University of Maine since 1865. They're a land grant school, they're a pretty good organization, I'm an alumnus, I like this university; they are working on deepwater windmills, but they're not allowed to bid on this contract because Statoil is in before' the university was ready to bid.\Statoil announced on Oct. 15 that it will not pursue the project in Maine.\Connors, the head of the state chamber, said this was one of the exceptions to his support to the governor.\'It's nice to see his endorsement of the university and having them be a player,' he said, 'but stepping away from a contract is probably one of the most baffling things -- I've yet to understand his rationale.'\Chapter 7: 'Noise' drowns out DV and ethics reforms\Julia Colpitts holds a master's degree in social work, is a licensed clinical social worker and runs the Maine Coalition to End Domestic Violence. On paper, she appears to be the very model of a modern liberal and the antithesis of someone who would respect LePage.\But Colpitts cannot be reduced to a stereotype. Her assessment of LePage was developed not from headlines, but from working with him - and Democrats - to change laws and attitudes about domestic violence.\'It's very easy to demonize people who don't think like we do,' she said.\Domestic violence - 'DV' to the advocates - was on LePage's radar from the beginning. In Colin Woodard's 'The Making of Paul LePage' in the Portland Phoenix in January 2012, he cited LePage's recollection that he left his Lewiston home at age 12 after his drunken father broke his nose and dislocated his jaw.\LePage said the doctor and nurse who treated him were angry, but there was little they could do.\'Back then, the laws aren't as tough as they are now,' Woodard quoted LePage as saying.\By the time LePage leaves office - even if he lasts just one term - the laws will be tougher yet.\LePage, Colpitts' group, Democrat Emily Cain, Maine Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Leigh Saufley and others have spearheaded such changes as requiring judges, not poorly-trained bail commissioners, set bail in DV cases; a validated risk assessment program that law enforcement will use in dealing with DV defendants; and a legal definition of strangulation in the criminal code.\LePage also appears in a DV public service video filmed in the Statehouse with the burly governor surrounded by a couple dozen men asking the public to 'stand up' again domestic abuse. The message is clear - men are the problem and the solution -- and it's coming from a range of men: cops, bikers, men in suits.\Colpitts said working directly with LePage means he will 'challenge you, engage you in disagreements, but, not in my experience is it intended to intimidate or harass you in any way.' His theme in working on the legislation, she said, was 'knowing that people will change if you hold them accountable.'\How does she jibe his commitment to ending DV with comments such as suggesting a legislator was figuratively sodomizing the state.\'He came back and said that wasn't an appropriate thing to say,' she replied. 'In my conversations with him, he never used language like that.'\Cain worked with LePage on DV as well as ethics reform, an issue that never went far in Democratic administrations. The LePage-Cain bill made four changes in the state's ethics laws, aimed primarily at better disclosure and transparency.\On the other hand, LePage vetoed a bill that would have required disclosure of donors to a governor-elect's transition.\Cain said the governor's successes in domestic violence and ethics laws - and their failure to be well known -- demonstrate the political challenge he faces.\'It's hard to have those examples actually come front and center stage because of all the other -- whether events or comments or dramas -- that surrounds the governor,' she said. 'It becomes hard for anyone in the public or even the Statehouse to celebrate those moments because they get drowned out by a lot of other noise.'\Chapter 8: Scenes from behind the scenes\Scene 1\Location: Dining room, Blaine House, the governor's mansion.\When: May 2013\Present: Gov. Paul LePage, First Lady Ann LePage, Communications Director Peter Steele and a reporter with a recording device.\ANN (to her husband): One thing - you've never forgotten where you come from, ever.\ANN (to the reporter): That's my job - to make sure he doesn't.\LEPAGE: And she does a very good job of it, really. She's like I am, we're both from the same type of environment. It's about people and some are disadvantaged, some are not; some are very elitist, some are spoiled -- which I have a problem with a lot of them. But it is where we come from and our kids, our kids are both, all five of them, have had a great education. All of them got a master's degree except for one. All very well educated, all did very very well in school, but they're not elitist, they're really down to earth every day people, except for one who likes to think she's better than she is. I have a daughter, Lisa, I love her, but she likes to sign her name and she puts Lisa LePage, MBA. So I get an honorary doctorate, so now when I sign my name, I'm putting Ph.D.'\LePage threw his head back and laughed. At himself, about his daughter -- and in the process told a lot about who he is and how he comes at his job, at his world.\In the world he came from- small town politics and running discount department stores selling salvage- there were not many elites, not many people putting on airs, a venial sin to working-class success stories.\But even in a small state like Maine, politicians play politics. The good ones can put on airs- and take them off as easily. They angle, they cajole, they cut deals. They say one thing one day, another the next. That's how they get things done. 'Politics is the art of compromise' is as anathema to Paul LePage as Barack Obama is ('I think Barack Obama is every bit as bad as Richard Nixon and some ways even worse.')\Goldthwait, the former independent legislator, said LePage has gone 'way beyond the bounds' of the commonly accepted way of doing business at the Statehouse.\To the regulars 'he wasn't playing fair because he was breaking all these rules of protocol and courtesy and everything else. To the people not in that inner circle, they loved it because nobody extends to them that courtesy and fair play.'\His economic adviser, John Butera, one of the Waterville pals he brought with him to the Statehouse, said, 'He doesn't care if anyone likes him.'\It was pointed out to him that a lot people say that when they're under attack.\'I know,' he said. 'But he really doesn't care if anyone likes him.'\LePage did not disagree: 'I want them (legislators) to respect that I'm trying to do the best I can ... If I wanted to be liked, I'd get another dog. If I want to get loved, I'll go home.'\Eves, the speaker of the house, is one of the two Democratic legislative leaders LePage has to work with in the second two years of his four-term term. The results of that relationship are perhaps best expressed by the number of bills LePage vetoed this year: a record 83.\Eves, a family therapist, likened LePage to a teenager whose 'parents'- Republicans in the Legislature - 'are complicit in this behavior. They enable him. When he sees he can get away with it, he keeps doing it.'\While Eves has run the House, state Sen. Justin Alfond of Portland has led the other chamber as senate president.\LePage called Eves a 'smart young guy who is inexperienced' and quickly added a less flattering take on Alfond, who he has known from Alfond's youthful years growing up in the Waterville area, the grandson and an heir of up-from-the-bootstraps multi-millionaire Harold Alfond, who died in 2007. Alfond owned Dexter shoes, a business he famously sold to billionaire investor Warren Buffett, and was Maine's best-known philanthropist.\As figures in Waterville, LePage knew the grandfather and his sons as well, and spoke highly of all of them. Not so the grandson.\'I can't say anything good about Justin ... Harold Alfond, I think was a great guy. Justin's dad (Bill), I love to pieces, I think he's a great guy,' LePage said. But, of the 38-year-old Justin he said, 'Not very bright, and very, uh, well, here's how I'll characterize Justin Alfond: Spoiled brat. Both in his personal life and his politics. Justin is very fortunate that his father and his grandfather were born ahead of him.'\Repeated requests to speak to Alfond never resulted in an interview.\But when he speaks publically of LePage, it is often to attack the governor where he wants to be seen as strongest- as a friend of business.\For example, regarding the Statoil deal, Alfond told the AP: ""What we have seen once again is how far this governor is willing to go to stop you dead in your tracks if he is against you. And it doesn't matter if you are an individual or a company that wants to invest millions of dollars.'\To LePage, Alfond is the poster boy of those 'elites' that he teases his daughter about being - the subset of Mainers who turn their noses up at LePage's tea party policies and crude remarks.\Rick Bennett is the former Republican president of the Senate and is seen as a moderate member of his party. He took over as state party chairman this summer. The 'discomfort,' he said, between LePage and so-called 'elites' goes both ways.\'They are the people who are doing fine and they find him a bit off-putting ... they like Maine the way it is,' he said. 'There's a lot of entrenchment from the people who have it good.'\Scene 2\Location: The law office of Republican state Sen. Roger Katz, overlooking the Kennebec River in downtown Augusta. The former high school basketball player has photos and clippings about the Boston Celtics hanging on the walls.\Time: Summer, 2013\Reporter: If you were LePage's chief of staff, what would you have done differently?\Katz: Be careful what you say and reach out to the other side ... I view the Democrats in the Legislature as my opponents, not my enemies. He was able to find common ground with Emily Cain on the issue of domestic violence. There are a lot of things like that ... just a number of areas where you can bring coalitions together around a single issue and actually get something done.'\The 66-year-old Katz represents the other side of the GOP from LePage and the tea party - once called Rockefeller Republicans and now sometimes RINOs, Republicans in Name Only.\Katz, though, sees himself as a true Republican, just like his father, Bennett Katz, a former president of the Maine Senate, known as a gentle soul and a gentleman.\His supports LePage's fiscal policies and he admires his determination: 'He's been like a dog with a bone ... getting us a government we can afford.'\But the governor's mouth has been too much for Katz.\He published an op-ed, endorsed by some fellow moderate Republicans, after the governor called those who protested his removal of a pro-labor mural from the state department of labor 'idiots.'\'By demeaning others, the governor also discourages people from taking part in debating the issues of the day - worrying if not only their ideas, but they themselves as people, will be the subject of scorn,' Katz wrote.\But he also recognizes they had much different home lives.\'If I had been brought up the way he was,' said Katz, 'the hardscrabble way, I would have been either dead or in jail.'\Katz came into the Legislature with LePage three years ago along with enough other Republicans to take over both branches of the government from their long Democratic and independent control.\The Republicans came with a mission - to put their philosophy of government ahead of the other side's. Their bywords were personal responsibility, accountability, lower taxes, fiscal prudence, private enterprise.\While liberals and progressives saw Maine being ranked at or near the top of 'welfare states' as a sign of its decency, Republicans of all stripes said the state was trying to throw a champagne party on a beer budget.\And while the moderates in the party might have hoped Mills had been chosen to carry their banner in the election, in 2010 the right was well-organized and the political winds favored them. And LePage - by policy and by style - fit their bill perfectly.\LePage, Katz said, 'came in with a formidable zeal to reverse 30 years of liberal Democratic direction and put us on a better track... myself I was proud to vote for him.'\'I'm like Chris Christie,' LePage said, referring the New Jersey governor and a popular figure with fiscal conservatives. 'He's blunt, and I'm considered over the top.'\But it's that very style that now threatens the hopes of Republicans and conservative independents to finish the job of righting the state's liberal tilt.\Al Diamon is the iconoclastic columnist who has been skewering Maine politicians for more than 20 years. He called LePage a 'boob' whose comments remind him of something you'd say after having 'three or four beers in a bar.'\(Although Diamon was not suggesting LePage has a drinking problem, LePage himself said he has heard people are saying that about him. Interviewed in his office on a Thursday, he said the last drink he had was the previous Monday, said he never drinks at the Blaine House unless it is a 'glass of wine with my wife' and has a beer after his weekly round of golf at the Waterville Country Club.)\Diamon also said LePage is one pol who has delivered what he said he would- at least so far.\'It's not only what the public wanted, it's exactly what he promised ... He didn't lie and he didn't change course, and he deserves credit for that,' Diamon said.\But because of his lack of political skills, he can't and likely won't get much more accomplished, Diamon said: 'He's his own worst enemy because style overcomes the substance... He's stubborn, stubborn.'\Not only, he and others said, do LePage's antics distract from his accomplishments, it reflects badly on all Republicans.\His 'allies in the Legislature are being tarred with the same brush,' Diamon said, so they distance themselves from him because they 'need cover back home.'\Without that cover, they may not get reelected and if they don't get reelected- and after two years of LePage enough did not that the R's lost the House and Senate to the D's- there goes their opportunity to fix the state the way they want it fixed.\'It's a tragedy,' Katz said.\Mills calls LePage's tenure a time of 'lost opportunities,' citing a series of fiscal initiatives such as deeper tax reform that were lost 'because style matters ... Reagan had style and he got all kinds of things done.'\Cutler said LePage's actions have done the opposite of advancing a new conservative agenda: 'The Democrats are emboldened politically by LePage's actions.'\Caron says style is half of the problem. The other is that LePage hasn't articulated a long-range plan for the state.\'If he has ... a philosophy, it's laissez faire. It's a lot of action on government and let the private sector do it all from there,' Caron said. 'The problem is we're competing in a world where that's not the way our competitors are operating at all. That's not the way China is operating or Massachusetts.'\Dan Demeritt was LePage's campaign spokesman and had the same job for a short time after LePage was in office.\He said he didn't know LePage well when he started working for him, but it wasn't long after that he came to appreciate LePage's ideas and his commitment.\'I would walk in front of train for him,' he said.\He saw a refreshing leader who had 'the ability to be transformational.'\But, to Demeritt, that has been lost because LePage approaches the job wrong.\'He would make a great general manager for the state of Maine,' Demeritt said, but it takes more than that to lead.\To lead, he and others observed, LePage has to 'sell his ideas ... go to the public and sell them.' And the anti-politician in him has not done that well enough.\Demeritt recalls that early in LePage's tenure, they were scheduled to have a press conference on a plan to help Brunswick residents who lost money to a fuel oil business that stopped delivering.\'We had to literally get him to take his suit jacket off the hanger and go to the press conference,' Demeritt recalled. 'His attitude was the staff has done the work and they should get the credit.'\To LePage, his critics just don't get it.\'They are missing what I'm here for, everyone missed what I'm here for. I'm not here to be a politician -- never intended ... I'm a turn-around specialist. And we know what needs to happen,' he said. 'We just can't get enough people to buy in.'\Scene 3\Location: The governor's office.\Date: Late August\Present: LePage, press aides Steele and Adrienne Bennett and a Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting photographer and reporter.\Background: About a week after press reports based on anonymous sources who claimed that, at a fundraiser in Belgrade, LePage had said President Obama hated white people. This latest report on top of others had that day attracted more national press coverage. LePage himself seemed to finally be accepting the reality that, as his wife said at the lunch interview, 'Paul LePage has no filter.' It was time to take the advice he had been getting from back in the campaign - control his mouth.\LePage: I've got this big eraser for when I open my mouth (holds up foot-long rubber eraser 'for Big Mistakes.')\He said he never said Obama hates white people. He said his point was that Obama missed a chance to bring the races together. 'He could have said I'm half white and half black. Instead they called him the first black president. I never said he hated white people. I said, I guess he doesn't like me.'\But, from now on, he said, he's going to try to keep a lid on the comments 'and talk out of both sides of my mouth like a politician.'\'They (staff) gave me this,' he said, holding up a roll of duct tape, leaning back, laughing, taking pleasure in his rep for shooting before he aims.\'I have what I consider is a decent sense of humor,' he said in the Blaine House interview. 'I don't take myself very seriously and I have found, in Augusta, politics is very serious and I don't take it seriously because I don't like it.'\(But he added that the Vaseline comment was wrong. 'It was a terrible one and I regret it ... everything else I've said ... I still believe them.')\Marty Linsky is a former Republican legislator in Massachusetts, a teacher of public leadership at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard - an expert in governing.\Linsky came to LePage's defense in a June story in the Portland Press Herald in which a member of the liberal group Moveon.org had written a letter to LePage complaining the governor wasn't doing enough to help the victims of a Lewiston fire.\LePage replied with what he had done and added, 'What have you done' - which shocked the letter-writer.\Linsky told the paper, ""I think it is a good thing that people in elected office sometimes tell constituents what they believe they need to hear, rather than what they want to hear.'\Linsky and others see LePage's comments like these as not only refreshing, but deliberate.\'It's pretty clear he enjoys the reputation and the notoriety he's generated,' Linsky said. 'It feeds his image of himself ... he revels in his bluntness' because he reinforces his self-image.\Payne, the Portland businessman, said when LePage makes his extreme comments his supporters say, 'Go Paul. Do it again. They're enthralled by him.'\Epilogue: At the end of the day ...\Public officials have two jobs: run the government and get re-elected.\To LePage's legion of critics, he's lost or losing on both counts.\Cutler said LePage's tenure- despite some progress- adds up to 'two and half years of a lost opportunity for the people of Maine.'\Eves, the Democratic speaker of the house, said voters will see that LePage 'is driving businesses out of the state, denying health care to 70,000 Mainers.'\When it comes to governing, those less opposed to LePage cite the pension, hospital debt and business-friendly orientation as lasting policy improvements.\But as for everything else that has or will happen under Paul LePage, as Payne pointed out, 'it's a long horizon for history to catch up to what actually happened.'\Caron said, 'The cup is half full and half empty when it comes to Paul LePage.'\'I'm from another world' than the political one, LePage reflected. 'I don't expect to change the world, I just hope to improve the world.'\With the election one year away, voters will have some time to decide if he has improved their world.\Diamon said LePage was ill-suited for the job - 'There's no way he should be governor.' His accomplishments like fixing the pension and hospital debt 'are not bread-and-butter issues to the average person.'\'I don't see how he can recover' by the time of the election, Diamon said.\Bennett, the head of the GOP and the man with the task of getting LePage reelected, said, 'I don't think Maine people will deny him reelection based on style points.\'At the end of the day,' he said, 'people generally get it.'\Naomi Schalit contributed to this story.

98,"Note: WITH THREE SIDEBARS SNOWE\For a time, during the heated congressional clashes over health care reform, many thought the most powerful politician in Washington was not President Obama, but a thin, raven-haired three-term senator from Maine.\""We as a party have spent the last six months, the greatest minds in our party, dwelling on the question, the unbelievably consuming question of how to get Olympia Snowe to vote on health care reform,"" thundered U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., in a noted House floor speech on Oct. 8, 2009.\""I want to remind us all that Olympia Snowe was not elected president last year. Olympia Snowe has no veto power in the Senate. Olympia Snowe represents a state with one-half of one percent of America's population.""\Grayson was referring to his party's frantic courtship of Sen. Olympia Snowe, the Maine Republican whose willingness to partner with Democrats on health care only seemed to deliver bipartisan anger and frustration.\Liberal Democrats were concerned more progressive aspects of the bill would be slashed by Senate Democratic leadership looking to cut a deal. Meanwhile, Republicans feared Snowe would blast a hole in their unified opposition.\Snowe had broken from the GOP on health care reform by voting to move the Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill to the full Senate - the only Republican on the five congressional committees dealing with health care legislation to do so.\This earned her not only boos from critics, but also salt.\""Olympia Snowe has sold out the country,"" wrote Erick Erickson on his conservative blog, Red State. ""So we should melt her. What melts snow? Rock salt. I'm going to ship this 5 pound bag of rock salt to her office in Maine. It's only $3. You should join me. It is a visible demonstration of our contempt for her. First she votes for the stimulus. Now this.""\According to the Wall Street Journal, one hardware store in Indianapolis received nearly 250 mail orders for five-pound bags of rock salt from across the country, all to be delivered to Snowe's office in Portland.\(Snowe staffers said the salt did arrive - and was donated to Preble Street in Portland, which provides shelter and other aid for the homeless and needy.)\Voting for reform should have cemented Snowe's place at the negotiating table, since at that time, Democrats were desperate for 60 Senate votes to overcome a promised Republican filibuster.\Spurred by repeated sentiments like Grayson's, however, Democratic leaders in the Senate abandoned the version of reform supported by Snowe for one more favored by the liberal wing of the party.\This left Snowe - who endured bitterness, jealousy and contempt from inside and outside Congress while working for the bill - feeling jettisoned by Democrats who said one thing, but really meant another, she said.\In hindsight, Snowe said this process offered a new meaning of bipartisanship.\""(The Democratic) version of bipartisanship is my vote for their bill,"" she said in a recent interview. ""It's an either/or environment at a time in which we need to be solving these great problems.""\'YOU CAN BRING PEOPLE ACROSS'\The push-pull nature of the health care debate was trying, Snowe said.\""You are in this partisan divide and as one who's straddling it, or trying to do the very best I can, you just have to stay focused, don't lose your values and do what you've always done,"" she said. ""That's sort of the advice I give to myself. You just have to stay totally centered, know why you are there, for what reasons, who you represent, why you came, what you are doing and what's the problem you are trying to solve. And that's what I've done.""\Snowe staffers say one of the boss's favorite sayings is, ""Process dictates product.""\""The idea is, like anything, if you do the right thing, and you build a real consensus, then you can bring people across,"" she said. ""And that just has not been (the Democrats') impetus,"" she said.\Despite this disenchantment, however, Snowe remains a bellwether on Capitol Hill. In addition to being the lone Republican to vote for any version of health care, she also supported the economic stimulus package, financial regulatory reform and a $26 billion state aid package.\Snowe and fellow Mainer U.S. Sen Susan Collins were among the few Republicans to support those bills. Snowe has voted with Republicans 67 percent of the time in this Congress, according to The Washington Post.\Collins has the same percentage, giving them the lowest percentage of party-line votes of senators in either party.\While Collins commanded the spotlight in stimulus talks, Snowe worked quietly to help shape the $787 billion measure by bringing the White House lists of spending initiatives she thought should be cut or added.\White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, the Obama administration's envoy to Congress, said the pair have represented Maine well.\""They are fierce about their independence and about their pragmatism,"" he said in a recent interview. ""When they look at a piece of legislation, their first question is, 'What is the immediate impact on Maine and how does this affect Maine?' They are tough about it, they keep asking the kind of core questions that need to be asked.""\SENATORS' CURRENCY COULD RISE\Their perch in the middle has created an interesting dynamic at home for Maine's senators, however.\Earlier this year, the Maine Republican Party made national headlines for adopting a strict, conservative party platform that supports, for example, eliminating the federal Department of Education and the Federal Reserve.\Despite this, the chairman of the Maine GOP said Maine Republicans are not disappointed with Snowe's and Collins' votes on the stimulus. ""No,"" said Charlie Webster. ""(But) I don't believe if the vote was held today that they would necessarily vote that way again.""\Webster believes the mood of the current party may influence the senators going forward, especially if Republicans have a strong showing in November's state legislative races. He defines political independence as a willingness to oppose party leadership, if that is what constituents expect.\""I expect that they will still be independent but I think they will be more comfortable voting in a more Republican, conservative way if they understand that people in Maine also agree with that,"" he said.\Snowe, however, stands by her vote. She said the economy would now be worse without the spending bill.\""It was mindful of small business, low-income families, those that were unemployed and those who were desperate to hang onto their jobs,"" she said of the final package. ""Could we have done better? Absolutely. Could we have done it differently? Absolutely.""\The senators could have the chance to do things differently if Republicans in Congress have a strong November showing. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the minority leader in the Senate, said if Congress tilts right, the currency of centrists like Snowe and Collins will increase.\""Regretfully from my point of view, and I think the two Maine senators would agree with me, this administration and the majority in Congress have basically pursued pretty far left agendas,"" he said. ""I think if there is a shift in the Congress this November, the president is likely to move to the political center and you can bet that Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins will be right in the middle of negotiating agreements that will inevitably be made in the center.""\'WORK AT MAKING THINGS WORK'\It's in negotiating that Snowe, and Collins, have earned cross-aisle accolades from fellow senators.\""(Snowe) was deeply engaged throughout health reform's evolution, regularly working to ensure families and small businesses in Maine and across the country would benefit from the new law,"" said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chair of the Senate Finance Committee. ""Sen. Snowe's tremendously hard work made the health care bill a better bill. In an increasingly toxic political environment in Washington, she only cared about one thing - delivering for Maine.""\Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., said the style used by Snowe and Collins used to be more prevalent among his colleagues, but no longer.\""Both of them have a deep respect for process in the Senate, which makes them almost unique, not just among Republicans but amongst senators,"" he said, referring to both of Maine's senators in a recent interview. ""I don't know what it is in the water, but there is something unique about the place that produces some damn good people.""\In Maine, their efforts are respected, if not lauded.\Tarren Bragdon, chief executive of the conservative Maine Heritage Policy Center, said Snowe and Collins have reflected Mainers' concerns about government spending.\""When you look at their record on Obamacare, some of their statements on cap-and-trade, and any number of smaller votes on tax-related issues, you can see that fiscal accountability in the moderate caucus and I think that's a huge shift that really reflects their concerns, which I think is the average Mainer's concern, about out-of-control government spending and debt,"" he said.\Christopher ""Kit"" St. John, executive director of the liberal Maine Center for Economic Policy, said he appreciates the duo's efforts to find solutions.\""They haven't gone along with the position of no,"" he said. ""They have decided they are going to work at making things work - legislating - which is what the people send them there to do. So for that, we are very grateful.""\L. Sandy Maisel, a Democrat and government professor at Colby College in Waterville, said Snowe has become one of the most respected senators in Congress.\""She has placed herself in the very upper echelon of senators in terms of respect with which she is held for her expertise in a number of policy areas and her work ethic,"" said Maisel.\Though he said he disagreed with her choice to vote against the health care law, Maisel said it highlighted her independence.\""Sen. Snowe clearly became very upset with the administration over the health care debate near the end and they lost her vote because of that,"" he said. ""In some ways what that shows is sort of her continuing independence.""\'I'M HELPING THE COUNTRY'\What burned Snowe on health care, she says, is how Democrats used a ""ram and jam"" method to block her ideas on reform and propel policies that lacked broad political support - like a public option for health insurance.\It was Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who unveiled a version of the bill that included a public option - a government-run health care plan.\Snowe, and even some Democrats, had long opposed a public option. Her approach, however, was not blanket opposition, like the rest of her Republican colleagues; she supported a compromise plan - a fallback option, or trigger.\According to Snowe's proposal, the federal government would set coverage and affordability thresholds for private insurance plans. If those goals weren't met after a certain time, it would ""trigger"" a public plan, with the threat of government competition driving changes in private industry, Snowe said. A similar model was employed by Medicare Part D and never triggered.\""I thought the trigger made good sense, and it did, but they used every mechanism to avoid it,"" she said. ""But not based on any rationale, rather it was avoiding making a concession to me as a Republican.""\The concessions Reid did make were aimed at swaying holdout Democrats.\This included a $300 million increase in Medicaid in Louisiana (which was dubbed by pundits as the ""Louisiana purchase"") for the vote of Sen. Mary Landrieu, and a permanent exemption for Nebraska of an additional state payment for a Medicaid expansion for Sen. Ben Nelson. This latter exemption, $45 million over the first 10 years, was known as the ""Cornhusker kickback."" Both were eventually dropped from the bill.\Snowe has said she wasn't interested in special treatment, but wanted to craft what she thought was a stronger piece of legislation.\""I feel an inordinate personal and professional responsibility to try to do everything I can to bring all my expertise and all my knowledge and thinking to the table to try to see if we can get it right,"" she said. ""But in any event, it's not always going to work out to your liking, but I do try to give it my level best.""\Reid eventually pulled the public option, leaving Democrats to rely on a rare procedural tactic called reconciliation to pass health care reform by simple majority, rather than the 60 votes needed to block a Republican filibuster.\Though Snowe ultimately sided with her party on health care reform, her early support for it - and her votes on the stimulus, jobs and financial regulation - still has fellow Republicans saying she's just helping out Obama.\Snowe contends her cause is much greater.\""I'm helping the country,"" she said. ""The thing is, I do it for the people I represent and for the country. And you are not always going to get what you think is entirely the best product, but you are going to do what you can that's going to achieve the ultimate result in the best interest of people. That's what it's about at the end of the day.""\MaineToday Media State House Writer Rebekah Metzler can be contacted at 620-7016 or at:\rmetzler@mainetoday.com\[Sidebar]\EDITOR'S NOTE\THIS IS THE SECOND OF TWO INSTALLMENTS EXAMINING THE RECORDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF MAINE'S SENATORS.

\
WASHINGTON -- Congress is set to approve the first change in fisheries regulations in a decade, after the Senate passed compromise legislation Thursday by voice vote.
\
The House must still consider the bill, but approval is expected before the chamber adjourns today for the year.
\
""Whether we are talking about a 300-year-old fishing village in Downeast Maine or remote fishing outposts in Alaska's Aleutian Islands, we must be bound by ... a thoughtful balance between sustaining both fish and fishermen,"" Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said in a prepared statement.
\
The legislation is important to Maine because commercial fishing employed 8,500 people in the state and provided $400 million in commercial landings last year. Changes in the rules ripple through the economy. Between 1996 and 2005, for example, groundfish landings in the state declined by a quarter, and the number of active fishing boats fell by almost a third.
\
The variety of interests at stake, from fishermen to environmentalists, and differences between the eight fisheries management councils that establish rules for various regions made a national policy elusive.
\
The law known as the Magnuson-Stevens Act governs how fish are managed in federal waters, within 200 miles of shore. It began in 1976 and was last updated in 1996.
\
With more than 100 lawsuits pending against the National Marine Fisheries Service, lawmakers hoped to legislate policy rather than have rules settled in court. The central puzzle was how to limit the total catch for depleted fish. The compromise settled on limits that don't exceed the ""maximum sustainable yield,"" as the Senate version had contemplated. Councils must ""establish a mechanism for specifying annual catch limits ... at a level such that overfishing does not occur in the fishery, including measures to ensure accountability,"" according to the bill. The House version would have set a total allowable catch limit, which critics argued would have been a dangerous loophole. A provision in the earlier Senate version would have allowed overfishing in one year to be counted against the following year's limit, but that element has been dropped.
\
""This historic legislation creates a cap-and-trade system that will provide an economic lifeline to fishermen and ensure a secure supply of fresh, local seafood for all Americans,"" said David Festa, a former policy director at the Commerce Department who is now the advocacy group Environmental Defense's oceans director.
\
Another point of contention involved the experimental programs that regional councils could adopt to protect specific fisheries. For example, herring fishermen could adopt a cap on tons caught and then divide the total among the licensed fishermen.
\
But concerns about what are called individual fishing quotas or limited access privilege programs include big companies buying out the licenses of family fishermen.
\
The compromise settled on a two-thirds referendum of the entire fishery required to adopt any quota program in New England. ""Our fisheries law must also accommodate scientific uncertainty, recognize that fisheries ecosystems are highly complex and ensure that our management system can adapt to ever-changing marine environments,"" Snowe said. ""There is no one-size-fits all solution to conserving the marine resources of our coastal communities.""
\
Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, supported the compromise after changes such as eliminating a provision to allow overfishing in one year to count against the following year's catch limit.
\
""Inclusion of these amendments in the final bill assures that small operations, especially family-owned boats and fleets, will continue to have access to their fair share of the resource and won't be swept aside by the massive industrial fishing juggernauts,"" Allen said in a prepared statement. ""It also ensures that decisions about fisheries management policy will take local concerns fully into account and provide for local voices to be heard in the management decision making process.""
\
Other provisions: n Allow international processing for fisheries that have traditionally been handled overseas, such as Maine herring fishermen enjoy with Canadian processors. n Deduct the steaming time for boats to get to fishing grounds from the clock counting a license's days-at-sea. n Clarify rules for experimenting with new catch methods or equipment. n Study the impact of regulations on fishing communities. n Authorize $338 million this year ramping up to $397 million in 2013 for science and technology to study fisheries.

100,"In her recent letter to the editor, Viki Kennedy of Wytopitlock expressed her concern for Maine's environmental future. I, too, hold a deep affinity for Maine's natural resources. The importance of these resources is multifold.\Unlike Kennedy, I know there is a long standing correlation between conservative ideals and environmentally conscious policies. John McCain has proven himself to be environmentally conscious and forward thinking; he has been active in efforts to protect the Grand Canyon and America's 388 national parks. Simply put, he believes conservation is a conservative issue.\The environment is a clear priority for McCain. McCain supports reducing greenhouse gas emissions and has proposed a market-based cap and trade system to do so. Additionally, McCain, unlike Obama, is a strong proponent of nuclear energy, a key to our nation's energy independence that does not emit carbon.\McCain has meshed financially sound energy decisions with environmentally minded alternatives, one of the many reasons why McCain has my support. His sound energy solutions leave me feeling less of an ominous chill and more of a hopeful spark.\Thomas C. Dickens\Orono"
101,"The U.S. Senate on Monday agreed to debate legislation that would limit greenhouse gas emissions to reduce their impact on global warming.\A vote could occur next week on the Climate Security Act of 2008, which would require companies to pay to emit carbon dioxide and other pollutants that get trapped in the atmosphere.\Proponents of the bill say the legislation is necessary to reduce long-term environmental damage. Opponents argue that the proposal amounts to a tax increase for affected companies.\Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins both voted for the motion to debate the bill, which passed 74-14.\The bill would cap emissions at 19 percent below current levels by 2020 and 71 percent lower by 2050. The primary mechanism would be a cap-and-trade system that sets emissions limits for companies and requires them to buy permits to exceed the limits.\The bill also would create a $568 billion fund to help states offset the costs of complying with the new regulations and pay for damage caused by global warming, such as rising sea levels or storm surges. Forty percent of the fund would be reserved for coastal states, including Maine.\Democrats and some Republicans argued Monday that Congress had to act soon to curb global warming's impact on the environment.\""It's no longer acceptable to take the status quo approach to legislating,"" said Snowe, a Republican who is one of the bill's sponsors, during a rally on Capitol Hill. ""This is a bold step forward in the right direction.""\Collins said the bill ""presents a practical approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. electric power, transportation and manufacturing sources.""\Senate Republicans opposed to the bill argued that passing it now would do nothing to reduce escalating energy costs or expand the supply of energy resources.\It remains unclear if the bill can get the 60 votes necessary in the Senate to end debate and force a vote. Also, President Bush has threatened to veto any legislation including mandatory limits.\Maine was among a group of states that sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2003 to regulate auto emissions.\Snowe and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., introduced a bill in 2006 that would have required the EPA to devise regulations to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the bill never made it to the Senate floor.\The House Energy and Commerce Committee, on which Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, serves, is writing a separate global warming bill and plans to hold hearings on the issue later this month.\Washington D.C. Correspondent Jonathan E.

102,"Activists fighting climate change in towns all over Maine are coming to Augusta today to share what they know about limiting greenhouse gas emissions.\Conservation measures at town halls, schools and public works garages are already in place, and 25 municipalities have signed a pledge to be ""Cool Communities,"" promising to cut global warming pollution.\This is a good effort, one that will benefit the environment as well as save the communities money. But the real action on climate change will not be in Augusta.\The long-awaited Senate climate change bill was finally introduced this week. Modeled on legislation that passed the House early this summer, this bill would for the first time put a price on carbon emissions and create a market for allowances that will create incentives to conserve.\Like the health care proposals currently before Congress, the climate change legislation also represents a historic shift and the politics will be just as contentious. But even though the votes may be just as close, the rosters may be different, with a divide that is more regional than partisan.\Democrats from rust-belt and mountain states that depend on coal mining and coal-fired power plants will not be likely to support the measure, which makes the votes of Maine's Republican Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins once again very important.\Snowe and Collins have both been supporters of climate legislation in the past, and their continued support will be needed if this proposal is to succeed. They should remain on board, because even though Maine is not a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, as a coastal state it stands to be a big loser if sea levels rise dramatically.\Not all the action will be in Washington. The global climate change conference in Copenhagen is coming up in December, and many developed and developing nations will be looking to see what kind of commitment America is making to address this problem. It will be important to the success of the conference that Congress pass a climate change law.\The cap and trade approach is derided by critics as a tax on energy that would have to be paid by consumers through higher prices. It's true that there are costs associated with new technology, but higher prices only matter if energy use keeps increasing.\A key part of this battle will be conservation efforts that will be motivated by making the most polluting power sources progressively more expensive over time. As long as the power produced by old coal-fired plants is the cheapest available, there is no incentive to switch to renewables.\That's why, even though it may be far from the action, the ""Cool Communities"" approach is a good idea. As these towns learn to cut down on energy use and employ cleaner practices, they will develop a level of expertise that all Mainer's will eventually have to tap into."

My magic wand is on the fritz, otherwise we'd have a big, new federal program to free America from its dependence on oil. Like other environmentalists, I'm sad that the calamity in the Gulf of Mexico hasn't spurred Washington to more vigorously promote America's exit from this curse.
\
The fault may lie with President Obama's timidity, a public scared by major new government programs or fossil-fuel interests flashing their campaign dough. Probably it's all three, but the bottom line is this: An all-out effort to unchain America from hydrocarbons is essential to national security, a healthy environment and economic prosperity in the 21st century. But it's not politically possible.
\
And so we must look at what's passable. Fortunately, there's one piece to the escape strategy that business leaders, military brass and the buying public all like ? and would create jobs. Most importantly, it has bipartisan support in Congress.
\
We speak of electric cars, specifically the ""Electric Vehicle Deployment Act of 2010."" Sponsored by Sens. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., the bill's goal is to electrify half of America's cars and trucks within 20 years. That, its backers say, would cut America's dependence on petroleum by a third. Similar legislation is before the House.
\
The Senate bill would name at least five communities to be models for electric-vehicle transportation. They would build stations where motorists could recharge their cars' batteries. Residents would be offered a $10,000 tax credit to buy electric cars. And the federal government would put $1.5 billion into research for improving electric-car technology.
\
Electric cars don't appear to be a very hard sell to those who would buy them. The first all-electric model, the Nissan Leaf, will hit the U.S. market at the end of the year. (The batteries will be made in Smyrna, Tenn.) But you won't be able to just pick one up, because the year's production is already sold out. More than two-thirds of the 19,000 preorders are from the United States.
\
The Chevy Volt will reach showrooms around that time. Its battery range of 40 miles is considerably smaller than the Nissan Leaf's 100 miles, but the Volt has a small gasoline engine to keep the car going if a recharging station is not handy.
\
In any case, more than 75 percent of Americans commute 40 miles or less a day. That means most of them could plug in their Volts at the end of the day and drive off fully charged in the morning.
\
Being both an environmentalist and a fan of high automotive performance can be awkward. But car makers are learning to put zoom into their fuel-efficient models. The Ford Fusion Hybrid, for example, gets 41 miles-a-gallon in the city, but can pull away from a stoplight at a respectable pace. ""Sustainable mobility solutions"" need not be as boring as they sound.
\
What about the source of the electric power? Although an all-electric vehicle puts out zero emissions, that is probably not true of the plant that provides the electricity. While California has moved its mix of electricity sources toward clean, renewable energy, other parts of America are still highly dependent on dirty, coal-powered plants.
\
However, electric cars cut global warming pollution even where coal supplies the power, according to a study by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash. That's because cars plugged in overnight employ unused capacity in the current electric system.
\
So let the brawl over cap-and-trade proceed. Outside of the oil business, most everyone seems enthusiastic about accelerating a move toward electric cars. Nothing should stop Congress from revving up the process. Right?

105,"The Portland City Council re-affirmed its commitment to fighting climate on Monday by passing one resolution supporting the Paris climate agreement and another calling on the federal government to add a new fee on fossil fuels.\The Portland City Council reaffirmed its commitment to fighting climate change Monday by passing one resolution supporting an international agreement to reduce greenhouse emissions and another calling on the federal government to add a new fee on fossil fuels. \The move comes after President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord, which committed the U.S. and 195 other countries to reducing carbon emissions that contribute to increasing temperatures, severe weather and rising sea levels. The agreement was negotiated under former President Obama. \Shortly after Trump withdrew from the agreement, the U.S. Conference of Mayors announced they would strive to achieve the goals set out in the Paris agreement on a local level.  \Another group, called the Mayors National Climate Action Agenda, wrote an open letter to Trump in March, expressing support for the Paris climate agreement. The letter also raised concerns about rollbacks of clean power and fuel efficiency initiatives, as well as proposed cutbacks in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. \Mayor Ethan Strimling added his name to the list of over 200 so-called ""Climate Mayors"" earlier this month. \The resolution commits the city to the Paris climate agreement. It says that ""the Portland City Council shall seek to implement the emissions reductions in greenhouse gases by innovative land use code, building code, support for electric vehicles, solar power generation and whatever other initiatives may meet with its approval for the continued protection of the city's own environment and the world's."" \The resolution highlights the city's efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions, including local energy efficiency requirements for new buildings, efforts to track energy usage in large commercial buildings, and the plan to establish a solar farm on an old landfill on Ocean Avenue. \The council also voted in support of a separate resolution calling on Congress to assess a new fee on fossil fuels. \The National Carbon Fee and Dividend Policy would assess a fee on fossil fuels at the point of production or import. That revenue would be returned as a monthly energy dividend to U.S. households, according to a June 5 memo to the council from Troy Moon, the city's sustainability coordinator. \""For the U.S., it would represent an important first step toward national scale climate mitigation that is compatible with existing cap-and-trade systems like New England's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative,"" Moon said. \Moon said the program would increase costs of fossil fuels at the wholesale and retail levels, which would ""level the playing field for clean energy, making it more attractive to investors and consumers."" \Moon said proponents estimate that two-thirds of households would break even under the program, but Maine households would benefit more than the national average ""because working class families fare better than the wealthy with equal rebates."" \Moon said the proposal also includes a border adjustment to discourage businesses from relocating to places where they can emit more carbon dioxide - a provision that could cause other nations to follow suit, effectively creating a ""global price for carbon."" \Back in April, the council endorsed a resolution seeking the use of 100 percent clean energy for city operations by 2040.

106," The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is not even considering the strictest possible curbs on mercury pollution as it finishes drafting new pollution regulations, according to environmental advocates.\ The EPA began a 30-day comment period Wednesday on various studies it has received while taking comments on the proposed regulations. The rules are scheduled to be completed by March 15.\ The EPA is considering strategies for reducing mercury pollution, which can cause brain damage in fetuses, for example, when women eat tainted fish.\ Two options would reduce mercury from coal-burning power plants by 30 percent by 2008, or 70 percent by 2018.\ But environmental advocates say that scientific studies suggest the pollution could be reduced 90 percent by 2008 if every plant uses the best possible equip- ment.\ ""The Bush administration should not ignore science to allow the biggest mercury polluters off the hook,"" said Matthew Davis, a spokesman for the advocacy group Environment Maine Research and Policy Center.\ A spokeswoman for the EPA said the 90 percent goal is unrealistic because the estimates rely on technology that is still being tested and not in widespread use.\ In a September interview with the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt called a 90 percent reduction ""fiction"" and said his agency would develop ""very aggressive"" rules.\ ""We don't think a 90 percent reduction by 2008 is possible unless you shut down power plants,"" EPA spokeswoman Cynthia Bergman said Wednesday. ""We are hoping to generate a more thoughtful discussion on the state of mercury control technologies and what's realistic and what's available today.""\ Mercury largely blows into Maine from coal-burning power plants in the Midwest, then falls into rivers and lakes in rain and snow.\ Mercury, a neurotoxin, can cause retardation, seizures, cerebral palsy, blindness and deafness in babies if their mothers have eaten too much tainted fish.\ Every freshwater river and lake in Maine carries an advisory to limit fish consumption, and 43 other states have advisories.\ Nationally, 17 percent of women of childbearing age have dangerous levels of mercury in their blood, according to a new EPA study. That means some 630,000 babies are at risk each year of developing learning disabilities and coordination prob- lems.\ Congress is expected to debate revisions to the Clean Air Act next year, with a goal of changing regulations for nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury.\ In the meantime, EPA proposed a rule on Jan. 30 to reduce mercury emissions from power plants for the first time. The EPA offered two alternatives to reduce the current 48 tons of mercury emissions each year.\ One option would require power plants to install what is called the ""maximum achievable control technology,"" which could reduce pollution by 14 tons per year by 2008.\ Another approach would create a ""cap and trade"" program under which power plants with lower emissions could sell credits to facilities that pollute more. The proposed cap would be 15 tons of mercury emissions nationwide by 2018.\ Leavitt has said his goals in drafting the regulations are to protect children and pregnant women from illness while stimulating new technology to reduce pollution and considering how the changes affect the economy.\ U.S. Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, argued that Leavitt reneged on a pledge that the EPA would do its own scientific analysis rather than rely on industry memos.\ The advocacy group Public Citizen found that President Bush's re- election campaign received $6.5 million from utilities and energy companies.\ ""Is there no end to the influence that polluters have purchased with their campaign donations?"" Allen asked.\ Environmentalists complain that the EPA is ignoring its own scientists who say the rules could reduce pollution more and faster. The scientists found it ""feasible"" to reduce mercury emissions 90 percent by 2008.\ ""They seem to be saying they're not even willing to look at it any more, which we think is unfair and outrageous,"" Davis said.\ But Bergman said the EPA must consider how widespread the technology will be and how many plants will use it.\ ""We have to develop a regulation that will work for every power plant, not just a handful,"" she said.\ Staff Writer Bart Jansen can be contacted at 202-488-1119 or at: bjansen@pressherald.com"
107,"Our democracy hinges on two votes: one in November and one in January. On Election Day, Americans have the opportunity to vote for Joe Biden for president and a Democratic majority in Congress. But even a Democratic sweep in November can achieve far-reaching change only if the new Senate abolishes the filibuster in January 2021.\We served as Senate chiefs of staff in 2009, when a wave of change brought the country a new Democratic president and a clear majority in the Senate. Almost immediately, however, Senate Democrats reduced their own power by failing to change Senate rules that allow a mere 41 senators to block legislation. This was a mistake that the next Democratic Senate should not repeat.\This lesson is critical in light of the issues on deck for 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, may require another robust stimulus package. In 2009, the threat of a filibuster prevented the Senate from even considering a spending bill equal to the challenge of the Great Recession. Today, the Republican majority in the Senate is blocking essential aid to unemployed Americans as well as to cities and states. Even if the election results demonstrate that the voters have rejected such tactics, a Republican minority in the Senate could similarly thwart federal pandemic assistance in 2021.\In light of the acute health-care challenges nationwide, the Affordable Care Act requires expansion, yet a lawsuit before the Supreme Court could result in it being declared unconstitutional. In 2009, the Democratic majority spent the better part of a year in a futile search for Republican votes for a health-care plan. In 2021, a Republican minority may be able to starve or cripple Obamacare by refusing to act.\Climate change demands aggressive efforts to compensate for the past four years of retreat. In 2010, the filibuster rule made it futile for the Senate to even hold a vote on cap-and-trade legislation passed by the House. In 2021, requiring 60 votes in the Senate would effectively preclude legislation bold enough to meet this existential challenge.\Just as important, the wave of support that has emerged for racial justice and police reform stands to yield meaningful legislation only if Democrats embrace majority rule in the Senate. As former president Barack Obama reminded us all in his eulogy for former representative John Lewis, filibusters have been used time and again to prevent, postpone and dilute needed change. Civil rights reform should no longer be held hostage until 60 senators approve.\The almost-certain costs of continuing to allow filibusters - costs borne by the unemployed, the sick, the environment and those seeking racial justice - easily outweigh the benefits. Indeed, the arguments for the filibuster have become flimsy with age.\For example, ending the filibuster would not end the Senate's ability to serve, in James Madison's words, as a ""necessary fence"" against the ""fickleness and passion"" of the public and the House of Representatives. When the Constitutional Convention allocated two Senate seats to each state, the largest state had roughly 10 times the population of the smallest. Today, the population of California is 68 times that of Wyoming. Requiring 60 votes for legislation allows coalitions of senators who represent less than 5 percent of the U.S. population to block any law. Ending the filibuster would actually move the Senate closer to the kind of balance anticipated by the Framers.\The Senate should not be stalled by fears that members would miss the filibuster after it is gone. First, the shattering of norms over the past four years strongly suggests that it would be naive to constrain the Senate majority's ability to pass legislation now in the hope that future majorities would reciprocate. Second, ending the filibuster in 2021 would allow for passage of essential reforms to voting rights and campaign finance rules. Those structural reforms would sharply reduce any risks to our democracy posed by majority rule in the Senate. Third, the filibuster is a recipe for the kind of gridlock that comforts only those who are already comfortable. But a pandemic, record unemployment, a rapidly deteriorating climate and the need to prove that Black lives matter suggest that it is time to value action over amiability.\Finally, ending the filibuster would recognize the increased partisanship in the Senate, rather than contribute to it. We served under senators who were able to construct bipartisan majorities for important legislation, and we hope that the Senate finds its way back to constructive engagement and robust debate. But in these partisan times, a rule designed to create an exceptional hurdle to legislation has become a brick wall between the Senate and progress. Next year, a Democratic Senate would have the opportunity to break down that wall, and strengthen our democracy, by ending the filibuster.\- Special to The Washington Post"
108,"AUGUSTA, Maine -- A group of lawmakers, fishermen, scientists and state officials are embarking on a gargantuan task: Develop a plan for Maine -- a state of fewer than 2 million people -- to address the global crisis of ocean acidification.\A commission established this year by the Legislature made Maine the first state on the East Coast to tackle increasing acidity that threatens marine wildlife and the state's lucrative fisheries.\That panel held its second meeting this week and is on schedule to deliver a report of recommendations to the Legislature in December. Central to its task is developing ways that Maine can try to limit the effects of ocean acidification.\That's no small job, considering much of the cause of increasing acidity happens far from Maine's coast, outside the jurisdiction of the state Legislature.\All told, the pH level in the Gulf of Maine has gone from a 8.2 -- where it remained roughly steady for 600,000 years -- to 8.1 in the course of a few centuries, according to the Rockland-based Island Institute.\That may not seem like much, but that's because pH scale is logarithmic. Sara Young, a marine scientist with Oceana, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit ocean conservation group, says it's helpful to think of it another way:\""The acidity of the ocean surface has increased 30 percent since the industrial revolution,"" she said Thursday. ""That 0.1 change is actually a huge deal.""\Young said acidification is caused mostly by the world's oceans absorbing carbon dioxide from the air, but other sources from the land -- such as runoff of nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorous from human activity -- compound the problem.\So while the issue is global in scale, efforts at the local level aren't fruitless.\""From a shellfish grower's perspective, the state can do something,"" she said. ""Washington and Oregon have been very successful in that. You can change the schematic in a coastal shellfish area, so you don't have such a large die-off in larval shellfish populations.""\Maine shellfish harvesters have been warning about increasingly acidic coastal waters -- they call it ""dead mud"" -- since at least three years ago. About the same time, Washington state suffered a rapid die-off in its oyster fishery, where larval oysters were dissolving before they had a chance to mature.\And it's not just oysters that are affected. Dr. Michael Tlusty, director of ocean sustainability science at Boston's New England Aquarium, said acidity affects all marine life with calcified shells, including mussels, clams, crabs, lobster, sea urchins and more.\And, he said, preliminary research at the aquarium suggests it also could have an effect on fish. Laboratory tests there indicated that increased acidity can alter the shape of an inner-ear bone found in many fish species that's associated with how the fish perceive the environment around them.\""There is a potential for huge impact, though we can't say anything definitive about that yet,"" Tlusty said.\Maine will likely follow in the footsteps of Washington state, where a Blue Ribbon Commission published an action plan in 2012 that included short-term solutions to reduce the release of nutrients and chemicals that contribute to acidification, as well as long-term solutions such as support for stricter national and international emissions standards.\Dr. Susie Arnold, a marine scientist with the Island Institute and member of Maine's commission studying acidification, said Thursday that reduction of global carbon dioxide levels will ""definitely"" be one of the group's recommendations. Other members emphasized the need for immediate action on coastal runoff issues.\While Maine may be the first Atlantic U.S. state to tackle the issue, commission co-chairman Rep. Mick Devin, a Newcastle Democrat, said he's optimistic that other states will join forces with Maine. Maryland is starting to explore options to put together a similar panel, and Devin is in talks with lawmakers in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\Young, the Oceana scientist, said that by banding together with other states, Maine could have an effect on national policies aimed at slowing acidification.\""It's important for states to apply that pressure. Individual states can have a lot of weight, especially with the economic backdrop of a shellfish industry,"" she said. ""When enough coastal states, that each agree to a plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, right there, you've got your federal policy.""\There's precedent for Maine participating in that kind of interstate cooperation on environmental regulation. The state is a member of the successful Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, wherein 10 northeastern states agreed to a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\""Our work is so much more valuable when other states get involved,"" Devin said.\Follow Mario Moretto on Twitter at @riocarmine.\Credit: Mario Moretto BDN Staff"
109," A reader from Peaks Island called two weeks ago to set me straight on the Sustainable Fisheries Act. We had a great conversation, and while we probably still don't agree on fishing rules, something he said has stuck with me.\ ""You know, Jack,"" he said with a laugh, ""I always said an environmentalist in Maine is someone who drives an SUV 200 miles to a mountain clear-cut for skiing in order to enjoy the outdoors.""\ That's a pretty big generalization, of course. But just how far off is it? Sometimes it seems the most ardent conservationists are public policy environmentalists with four-wheel drives and hard-to- heat homes. Sure, they're well-versed in the arcane language of emission cap-and-trade programs, the intricacies of renewable portfolio standards and the best-practices world of set backs, stack heights and non-point sources. But when it comes to personal environmentalism, what are they doing to reduce, reuse and recycle?\ It's a fair question as we celebrate Earth Day 2002 next Monday.\ THE FIRST EARTH DAY, observed in 1970, recognized that conservation could no longer be simply a matter of private concern. According to Earth Day's founder, former Sen. Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, the world was in dire need of environmental political action, but the policy-makers didn't seem to notice.\ Nelson tried a number of approaches to thrust environmental concerns on to the public agenda, but without much success. Finally, the eureka moment occurred when, during a 1969 speaking tour on conservation, Nelson found himself competing with teach-ins on poverty and anti-war protests.\ ""Suddenly,"" Nelson recalled later, ""the idea occurred to me - why not organize a huge grassroots protest over what was happening to our environment?""\ The concept quickly outpaced Nelson's ability to manage it. ""We had neither the time nor resources to organize 20 million demonstrators and the thousands of schools and local communities that participated,"" Nelson admitted. ""That was the remarkable thing about Earth Day. It organized itself.""\ Since that time, environmental issues have become front-burner politics, both nationally and globally. Environmental positions have decided presidential elections. Articulate and informed lobbying of Congress led to the passage and substantive revisions of laws such as the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. Public awareness has given birth to an incredible number and variety of political action groups.\ Since that first Earth Day 32 years ago, policy changes have resulted in a 98 percent reduction in toxic lead emissions, a 35 percent cut in sulfur dioxide and a 32 percent reduction in carbon monoxide from all sources. Wetland losses have been cut in half while the number of clean rivers has doubled.\ THAT'S ALL to the good, obviously, but I fear that the focus on environmentalism as public policy might undermine personal conservation - the complaint that my Peaks Island reader raises.\ A political science professor I know likes to tell the story of his aunt, an elderly woman who joined every environmental group she could. Her special concern was ""the hole in the ozone"" and she volunteered all her time and energy to outlawing chlorofluoro carbons (CFCs) from consumer products.\ ""One night I was supposed to drive her to a benefit for one of her environmental causes, and when I stopped by the house, she was layering on the hair spray,"" he says. ""When I asked her about the CFCs in the spray, she smiled at me and said, `Hole or not, I still have to look good.' ""\ And there, once again, is the vexing free-rider problem that undermines collective action. For any one person in a society, the ideal outcome is to get everyone else to bear the costs of a social good. So we end up passing laws that everyone, individually, tries to get around.\ Environmentalism ought to be as much a lifestyle as a public policy position. So here's my Earth Day 2002 challenge: Go to the web site www.earthday.net and take the ""Ecological Footprint Quiz.""\ The quiz consists of 15 questions about what you eat, how much waste you generate, what kind of housing you use and how you travel. Based on where you live - country and climate count in this quiz - your answers are used to generate a personal ecological footprint. It's the equivalent to the amount of land that you use as a consumer.\ There are two important measures of your conservation ethic. The first compares your footprint to the average ecological footprint in your country (in the United States, the national average is a whopping 24 acres per person). The second measure calculates the total amount of productive acres needed if ""everyone lived like you."" Suffice it to say that if everyone in the world lived like the average American, we'd need more than five Earths to sustain us all.\ Unfortunately, we've got just one. Let's tread lightly before it's all gone.\ - Jack Beaudoin, an editorial writer, can be reached at 791-6481\ or jbeaudoin@pressherald.com."
110," AUGUSTA - Business leaders gathered in Augusta on Tuesday to hear how Maine's increasing focus on global warming could not only save companies money but might also prove profitable.\ Under the proposed Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the nation's first multistate program to reduce emissions tied to global warming, six fossil fuel-burning power plants in Maine would have to cap and then cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2019. State lawmakers are slated to begin debating Maine's role in RGGI in the coming weeks.\ While clearly beneficial to the environment, the RGGI, or ""Reggie,"" program will give rise to a new ""carbon emissions trading"" industry valued at hundreds of millions, and perhaps billions, of dollars in the U.S. alone.\ Under a cap-and-trade program, participating states - or countries in the case of the Kyoto agreement - set limits on greenhouse gases by allotting a certain number of emissions ""allowances"" or ""credits"" to each power plant based on past emission levels.\ Power plants that are more efficient than required can either bank their excess allowances for future use or sell them to plants exceeding their limits. The market-based system offers companies a financial incentive to go beyond their emissions goals.\ Plants can buy carbon ""offsets"" from other industries that are reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Examples of offsets include landfill gas recovery, reforestation and methane recovery on farms.\ That is where Maine businesses stand to benefit financially from RGGI.\ Claudio Lutzky, whose employer, MGM International, helps develop and commercialize projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, told business leaders attending a Maine International Trade Center forum that the carbon trading system established under the international Kyoto agreement offers RGGI states some guidance.\ While ""tricky"" and complicated to achieve, it would be beneficial for RGGI states to get involved with the global carbon trading and offset market, now valued at $9 billion, Lutzky said.\ ""Climate change is a global problem and the only efficient and effective solutions are going to be global,"" Lutzky told the crowd of several dozen. ""The only way to effectively mitigate global climate change is through cooperation.""\ John Rankin, the United Kingdom's consul general based in Boston, pointed out that Britain has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 14 percent in recent years while growing the national economy by 49 percent.\ ""The claim that you cannot reduce emissions and at the same time achieve economic growth is simply not true,"" said Rankin, who has traveled to Maine several times in recent months to participate in RGGI events.\ Audience members asked the panel questions about expanding the types of activities eligible for offsets as well as some of the administrative challenges of the global market.\ William Brinton of Woods End Laboratories in Mount Vernon said he believes many Maine farmers stand to benefit financially from RGGI. Woods End Laboratories is interested in developing bio-energy and methane capture on farms, which would be eligible for offsets in the carbon market.\ ""The Maine farm economy is not robust or strong,"" Brinton said afterward. ""This could be a feather in the cap"" for farms.\ Tuesday's forum came one day after the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a major decision that could dramatically reshape national policies on global warming.\ In a 5-4 decision, the court said that the federal Environmental Protection Agency can regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases from car tailpipes under the Clean Air Act.\ The court did not require the EPA to do so but indicated that the agency must come up with solid scientific reasons - not political ones - to justify not regulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks.\ The decision was widely regarded as a major rebuke of the Bush administration's policies on global warming. Maine joined 11 other states in bringing the lawsuit against the EPA.\ David Littell, commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, said the decision not only strengthens Maine's stringent car emissions policies but also the state's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under RGGI.\ ""It puts us in a posture of moving forward very definitively and essentially removes what was the most substantial legal impediment"" to RGGI, Littell said.\ Cathy Lee, managing director of Lee International Business Development, which provides consulting services on alternative energy and sustainable development projects, said the court's decision reinforces the need for Maine to move forward with RGGI.\ ""It's not perfect,"" Lee said of the RGGI framework. ""It's not as comprehensive as some would like to see it, but it's a start. And particularly given yesterday's Supreme Court decision, there's no question this is the [direction] things are going."""
111,"Learn More Online: Acid rains effect on forests: http:// www.ec.gc.ca/acidrain/acidforest.html The Environmental Protection Agency on acid rain: http://tinyurl.com/yr8ka6 Answers to questions about acid rain: http://www.maine.gov/dep/air/faqs.htm COMING UP READ THURSDAY'S Portland Press Herald to learn what researchers are finding out about toxic pollutants in Casco Bay.\ Acid rain is still a threat to more than one-third of Maine's forestland, according to a new study presented Tuesday in Portland.\ While not the urgent and unregulated threat it was in the 1980s, enough acidic pollutants are settling across the landscape today to gradually weaken forests in sensitive areas, the study found.\ The amount of forestland at risk statewide totals about 5.9 million acres, with most of that area spread throughout the valuable commercial forests of northern and western Maine.\ ""Acid rain is still very much an issue in Maine and New England,"" said David Littell, commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.\ The report does not include evidence of slowing forest growth or weakened and diseased trees, but it warns that sensitive areas eventually could face such problems at the current rate of acidification. It is expected to focus scientific attention back on the problem and provides state forest managers and private landowners a map of where to look for impacts.\ ""It should be considered the first step in a more detailed assessment,"" Littell said.\ Acid rain, or acid deposition, occurs when chemicals react in the atmosphere to form acids that settle onto forests and waterways in precipitation or as dry particles. The primary pollutants responsible for the phenomenon are sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants and motor-vehicle exhaust.\ Acid deposition damages buildings and monuments, and it changes the chemistry in the environment. It can increase the acidity of lakes and streams and kill aquatic animals and plants. In forests, the acids react with the soils, removing important plant nutrients such as calcium. Once those nutrients are removed beyond the soil's capacity to replace them, trees grow more slowly and become vulnerable to freezing, insects and disease.\ Power plants have dramatically cut acid rain pollution since 1990, when federal regulations kicked in. As a result, precipitation in New England is significantly less acidic than it was 20 years ago, officials said. The success of a cap-and-trade system to cut sulfur dioxide pollution has been so successful it is often cited as a model for fighting global warming pollution.\ State and regional officials knew acid rain hadn't been eliminated, but did not know what effect it might still be having.\ The study presented Tuesday at the University of Southern Maine was conducted by Ecosystems Research Group of Norwich, Vt., as part of a regional mapping effort across New England and eastern Canada. The Maine DEP provided $40,000 for the project, and other sources, including the federal government, contributed another $40,000.\ Officials hope to expand the findings to include bodies of water as well as forests.\ The study is based on a complex model that considers such factors as geology and nutrient capacity, the rate of nutrient removal through logging, and the amounts of acid deposition in different parts of the state. Although more acid deposition occurs in coastal Maine, the geology and logging practices in northern and western Maine make those areas more susceptible to acidification, said Eric Miller, the lead scientist on the project.\ Similarly, while other New England states receive more acid rain pollution from the Midwest, Maine has a higher percentage of at- risk forestland than all but Rhode Island. Still, Maine has no known areas that are so sensitive that they are showing signs of damage.\ ""We do not see growth reductions at this point,"" said David Struble of the Maine Forest Service. There is more wood in the Maine forests now than 50 years ago, he said. ""That doesn't mean, necessarily, we don't have a problem looming,"" he said.\ Walter Emrich of J.D. Irving Ltd., one of Maine's largest forestland owners, said the study doesn't put acid rain back at the top of forest ecology concerns. ""I don't think anything's going to impact us immediately,"" he said.\ But Emrich does plan to take a closer look at the maps to see which Irving lands might be most susceptible and worth monitoring.\ Miller, the scientist, said it's impossible to say what the continuing effects of acid rain will mean as global warming disrupts the climate and the forest ecology.\ Heat actually speeds up the process of replenishing soil nutrients for trees and other plants. On the other hand, droughts, which are expected to accompany a global warming, can slow down that process.\ ""It's going to be a complicated trade-off,"" he said.\ Staff Writer John Richardson can be contacted at 791-6324 or at:\ jrichardson@pressherald.com"
112,"ATexas oilman has decided the United States needs a plan to end our dependence on oil imports from nations such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, which use the hundreds of billions of dollars we pay them to fight against our best interests abroad.\Billionaire T. Boone Pickens, who is 82, discussed the details of his plan with members of the editorial board in a telephone interview last week.\He said his comprehensive ""Pickens Plan"" (www.pickensplan.com) will use fuel and clean-energy options available within the United States and some of its closest allies to generate electricity and keep trucks and cars moving along our highways.\Pickens says our ""addiction to foreign oil"" threatens our economy, environment and national security, and he also claims he has commitments from political leaders to include his ideas in any energy plan Congress creates.\It's hard to argue with his diagnosis about some of the OPEC countries. The Saudis support Wahhabi extremists and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez stirs up trouble with his neighbors while crushing dissent at home.\Pickens' problem is in the details of his plan. Each of its points is defensible, but it's not at all obvious that we can remake large segments of the national infrastructure and economy without spending so much money that it would take decades to repay the investments his plan requires.\But if his claims of support in Washington are valid, it's important to understand what he has in mind.\What got Pickens going was the rise in the use of imported oil since the Carter-era OPEC oil embargo. In the 1970s, he says, we imported 24 percent of our oil, and now we import nearly 70 percent of a much larger total, spending a whopping $475 billion on petroleum imports in 2008.\Every day 85 million barrels of oil are pumped out of the ground around the globe, and the United States uses 21 million. That's a full 25 percent of production being used by just 4 percent of the world's population, he notes.\That, however, is where his analysis hits its first bump - the U.S. GDP that oil allows us to produce tops 20 percent of the globe's economic output. The U.S. economy, at $14.3 trillion in 2009, is second in total value only to the entire European Union.\Along with Europe, the United States is thus a principal driver of many other nations' economic well-being. Thus, it would be hard to maintain our standard of living and lift up other nations while using less energy.\Of course, growth will require using more. Pickens is not opposed to that, but he wants us to redirect our economy both in the types of fuel we use and the ways in which we use them to focus on reducing imports from unfriendly nations. Thus, he wants the government to support:\nCreating ""millions of new jobs"" by building enough wind turbines to generate 22 percent of our power from that source, which currently supplies only about 3 percent of the total.\nBuilding a ""21st-century backbone electrical grid"" to get that power across transcontinental distances, which the regionalized grid we now have cannot support.\nGiving incentives to homeowners and businesses to upgrade insulation and other energy-saving improvements to keep demand down.\nAnd converting the nation's 8 million commercial trucks from gas and diesel fuel to run on natural gas, which is in plentiful supply in this country.\Although he doesn't mention them in his plan, Pickens is not opposed to major expansions of solar and nuclear power, more drilling for domestic oil and the use of ""cleaner coal.""\All those sources are domestic, not foreign, and thus meet his goal of someday turning off the OPEC spigot.\But he opposes cap-and-trade, seeing it as a tax that would depress the economy instead of boosting it.\His plan contains many defensible positions, even wise ones, and he's right that everything done or even suggested to date falls short of making this nation truly energy-independent in any reasonable period of time.\He has done us a great favor by using his vast resources to point that out and spur us to greater efforts toward creating a comprehensive energy plan focused on domestic resources.\However, he has also shown us how huge the problem is, and how much we will have to do to solve it. True, he makes it all sound easy, and it's not.\But he has given us his vision as a starting place - and reminded us that unless we do start somewhere, we will never accomplish anything."

WASHINGTON -- It didn't take long for the speculation to begin after Karen Mills -- a Maine resident who serves in President Barack Obama's Cabinet -- had announced her plans to step down as head of the U.S. Small Business Administration.
\
Mills for governor in 2014?
\
""My first task is to fulfill my promise to the president to ensure an orderly transition at the SBA,"" Mills, a Democrat, said two days later during her first interviews since the announcement. As for any future plans or political aspirations, Mills said she ""had not yet begun the process"" of deciding her next step.
\
Mills' tenure as SBA administrator began in 2009 and was dominated by the administration's efforts to deal with the recession.
\
For her part, Mills said she was proud of her agency's work to put more than $100 billion in loans into small businesses' pockets in four years by working to thaw banks' frozen credit lines through SBA-guaranteed loans. She also discussed her agency's efforts to reduce red tape, such as streamlining application processes and instituting an expedited, online system for filing for disaster assistance.
\
Mills plans to return to Maine, where her husband, Barry Mills, is president of Bowdoin College. She sees significant potential in her home state for job growth in such fields as manufacturing and energy.
\
""We have the potential to be one of the places where we see growth in manufacturing jobs,"" Mills said, adding that Maine is attractive to entrepreneurs because it is a ""spectacularly beautiful state with a great sense of community.""
\
As for any future political plans, Mills' answer was not a ""yes"" but not a definitive ""no,"" either. Given her high-level experience in Washington and prior experience as a Maine-based venture capitalist, she could find favor with Democrats looking for a candidate with a strong business background.
\
No Snowe
\
Obama apparently can leave one name off the candidate list for his next SBA administrator: Maine's former U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe.
\
Obama reached out to Snowe, a Republican, in 2009 to gauge her interest in a Cabinet position, but the senator declined. (Snowe has never said publicly which position it was.) And it's not beyond the realm of possibility to envision the president approaching Snowe again, but this time to succeed Mills.
\
Snowe served for years as either chairman or ranking member of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. She not only nominated Mills for the SBA post, she also reportedly urged Obama to add the position to his Cabinet.
\
""No, she hasn't received any calls from the White House,"" her spokesman Lucas Caron said when asked last week. Snowe also had this to say in December when asked whether she would consider a Cabinet position:
\
""If there was some way I could contribute in other ways, but not in a Cabinet post,"" she said. ""I never rule anything out, obviously, but my plan now is to focus on speaking out and helping in any way I can to contribute to rebuilding the notion that compromise and consensus have to be an essential ingredient of the legislative process.""
\
Fix the debt
\
Snowe has, however, lent her name and presumably her time to the Fix the Debt Campaign.
\
Fix the Debt is a nonpartisan organization of corporate and political leaders trying to pressure Congress to take long-term, definitive action to address the nation's $16 trillion debt. While some activists on the left dismiss it as a corporate pawn group, Fix the Debt has made a name for itself in the debate and has attracted high-profile political leaders to its cause.
\
Snowe joined the campaign's Congressional Fiscal Leadership Council last week.
\
Former Maine Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, and former Maine Senate President Rick Bennett, a Republican, serve as co-chairmen of the Fix the Debt Campaign in Maine.
\
Mainers take climate action
\
Several hundred Mainers are expected to join tens of thousands of other activists on today for what is being billed as the largest climate change rally in history.
\
More than 160 organizations from across the country are involved in the Forward on Climate rally, which will take place on the National Mall. Participants then will march from the Washington Monument to the White House in an effort to pressure Obama to take action on climate change and the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.
\
Locally, the Sierra Club Maine, the Natural Resources Council of Maine and Environment Maine -- among others -- were organizing groups to go to Washington.
\
Much to the chagrin of environmental activists and some left-leaning Democrats, the Obama administration did not push for major climate change legislation during the president's first term and the issue was rarely mentioned on the 2012 campaign trail.
\
However, the president has signaled a major shift by talking about the need for action on global warming in both his inaugural address in January and last week's State of the Union address.
\
Any attempt at major climate change legislation in Congress -- such as a national tax on carbon dioxide emissions or a federal cap-and-trade system -- is guaranteed to encounter ardent opposition.

115,"A look back to the 1960s shows that the United States has made a lot of environmental progress since the first Earth Day, held on April 22, 1970. Still, although the nation's rivers and streams are cleaner, the use of toxic chemicals is strictly regulated and recycling and energy conservation are mainstream, the country - and the world - face the largest environmental threat yet, in the form of climate change.\Because the threat is so dispersed and its effects aren't crystal clear, combating climate change is proving more difficult than banning DDT or passing the Clean Air Act. Passing laws that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in the U.S. and around the world, should be the focus of this Earth Day, and, likely, many of those to come.\Before 1970, there were no federal regulations to stop the dumping of waste and toxins into the nation's water and air. There was no Environmental Protection Agency.\It was not until the Clean Air Act was amended in 1970s that the federal government set limits on air pollution. Previous versions of the law simply required monitoring.\The 1970s rewrite often was referred to as the Muskie Act because Maine Sen. Edmund Muskie played a leading role in writing the legislation.\Since passage of the act, emissions of toxic lead have dropped 98 percent and emissions of carbon monoxide have dropped by nearly a third even though driving has more than doubled.\In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act, again with advocacy from Sen. Muskie. The Ocean Dumping Act was also passed that year and the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974.\These bills, like environmental legislation before and since, faced stiff opposition from corporations that would have to change their practices.\Such struggles between protecting water, air and earth and corporate profits have continued through the decades, culminating in the current debate over climate change. Industry-funded campaigns have planted doubt about the extreme changes in weather in recent years, and more pointedly, sought to prove that rising temperatures, increasingly devastating storms and widespread drought are part of a natural cycle, not the result of human activities.\Fortunately, senators from Maine again have played a leadership role in pushing environmental legislation. Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins long have championed more fuel efficient, less polluting cars, stiffer air pollution regulations, more rigorous alternative energy development and a system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\Sen. Collins, along with Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat, has sponsored a bill that many view as more politically palatable than a cap-and-trade measure pushed by Sens. John Kerry, Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman. The Collins-Cantwell bill uses a so-called cap-and-dividend approach. Carbon emissions would be capped and emission allowances sold at federal auctions. Seventy-five percent of the proceeds go directly back to consumers, with the remained put into a trust for green technologies, aid to affected workers and other programs.\The bill also would ease regional and economic disparities, according to a recent analysis.\After more than a decade of inaction on climate change, such legislation offers a way for the U.S. again to play a leadership role, a role that is sorely needed as global talks have foundered.\A conference on climate change in Copenhagen last year was a disappointment, ending with little progress. A major area of concern is who will pay for the changes needed to reduce emissions.\Poorer nations rightly argue that they often face the most dire results of climate change - such as droughts and flooding, which leads to widespread famine and the displacement of millions of people - but are not the major cause of the problem. In addition, they don't have the financial resources to pay for significant changes.\""Only a wealthy society can afford the economic sacrifices necessary to put expensive scrubbers on smokestacks, to build and maintain the infrastructure necessary to sustain clean waterways, and to set aside productive lands for conservation and species protection,"" writes James Taylor, a senior fellow for environment policy at The Heartland Institute.\""For nations such as China, India, Bangladesh, Laos and Vietnam ... imposing expensive environmental mandates on citizens who cannot afford food, clothing, and shelter is not an option,"" he adds. Mr. Taylor uses Earth Day to praise free markets as the cause of environmental improvements.\While this is simplistic, the fact that China, India and other countries in Asia have rapidly growing and increasingly prosperous populations - which means they can afford cars and need more power plants, thereby increasing greenhouse gas emissions - is both an opportunity and a problem for the rest of the world.\A challenge for coming climate talks is to develop a system that helps developing nations reduce their emissions while improving the quality of life for their residents; this likely will include large cash payments from wealthier nations to the world's poorest countries. At the same time, to be taken seriously countries such as the United States must lead by example.\Passing climate change legislation today would be as significant as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act of four decades ago."
116,"AUGUSTA -- Maine scientists, fishermen and environmentalists urged lawmakers Wednesday to embrace a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent and begin work on a new ""action plan"" to address climate change.\But while manufacturers and energy producers welcomed the proposed discussions, they warned against setting unrealistic requirements on industries that have already dramatically reduced emissions.\""Before you set a limit on emissions and a timeline for that, first find out where you are,"" said Tony Buxton, an attorney representing the Industrial Energy Consumers Group.\After years on the political back-burner, climate-related issues are once again on the policy agenda in Augusta. Democratic legislative leaders, who have majorities in both the Maine House and Senate, and Gov. Janet Mills have made it a top priority amid growing scientific evidence that climate change is already affecting Maine fisheries, farms and woodlands.\Lawmakers heard nearly seven hours of testimony Wednesday on two bills that would set a goal of reducing statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 or 2050. Both measures as well as a third bill would also direct the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to update the state's 15-year-old ""climate action plan"" that offered strategies for reducing emissions to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.\None of the bills specify how the state would achieve those additional reductions but, instead, would rely on the Maine DEP to craft regulations with input from a diverse set of interests. But supporters said a new road map is needed for Maine to achieve its share of the goals established by the 2015 international Paris Climate Agreement and embraced by the Mills administration.\""We have met the goals we set in 2003 and 2004 for 2020, but perhaps that was just low-hanging fruit,"" said Rep. Ralph Tucker, D-Brunswick, sponsor of the bill to reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050. ""But I am convinced that, if we really try, we can rise to the occasion and continue the remarkable progress we have made so far.""\A DEP official called an 80 percent reduction by 2050 ""appropriate"" and said the goal - along with an update to the 2004 climate action plan - will be ""fully embodied"" in a forthcoming bill from the governor's office.\""The department agrees that policymakers and stakeholders should undertake the work described in these bills but we recommend it be done by work groups of the governor's Climate Council,"" said Melanie Loyzim, deputy commissioner at the DEP.\'we're at the tipping point'\South Thomaston lobsterman David Cousens said while climate change has likely contributed to the five-fold increase in lobster landings, he believes ""we're at the tipping point now"" as water temperatures rise and invasive species move in. Cousens said he worries whether his sons will be able to continue lobstering as populations of the iconic crustacean creep farther up the coast into cooler Canadian waters.\The former Maine Lobstermen's Association president also took a swipe at President Trump's repeated claims that climate change is a hoax driven by ""fake science.""\""I don't know what 'fake science' is but I know when I was in high school or college, we based all of our information on science,"" Cousens told members of the Legislature's Environment and Natural Resources Committee. ""I believe that 99 percent of the scientists in the world are right, and the 1 percent that says it's a hoax are not.""\GULF OF MAINE WARMING FAST\Recent research has shown that the Gulf of Maine is warming faster than almost anywhere else in the earth's oceans.\Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, pointed to the loss of the lobster fisheries in Rhode Island and southern New England to show that ""there is only so much warming that lobsters can take.""\Pressed by a lawmaker on Maine's tiny contribution to global climate emissions, Pershing described climate change as ""the ultimate tragedy of the commons"" that will require contributions from everyone, large and small.\Maine has made significant progress over the past 15 years in reducing some greenhouse gas emissions but not in all sectors, falling behind in transportation.\Power plants and large, industrial facilities such as paper mills reduced emissions by 73 percent between 2002 and 2015, in part, by switching from oil to natural gas. Maine's participation in the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - the nation's first cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions - has also encouraged efficiencies while generating hundreds of millions of dollars for equipment upgrades and home weatherization.\Emissions from cars, trucks, planes and other components of the transportation sector remained flat during that time, however, and accounted for 52 percent of all emissions in Maine in 2015.\Manufacturers and representatives from energy-intensive industries urged lawmakers to remember their dramatic reductions when setting future goals. Simply imposing a further 80 percent reduction in industrial emissions, they warned, could have cataclysmic impacts on those companies.\""Please don't ask us to do more until other sources have done similar levels"" of reductions, said Scott Beal, environmental security manager for Woodland Pulp in Baileyville, which spent $16 million to switch to natural gas.\THREAT OF LOST JOBS\The most foreboding comments came from Michael Martunas, environmental compliance manager at Dragon Products Company, a Thomaston cement manufacturing plant with 107 employees. Martunas warned that an 80 percent reduction is simply unachievable because greenhouse gases are emitted by the components of concrete, not as a result of fossil fuel combustion for energy. But Americans will still need to buy cement from somewhere, even if Dragon goes out of business.\""If either bill is enacted, our cement plant will close and approximately 500 jobs supported by the plant will either cease to exist or lose revenue provided by Dragon,"" Martunas said. ""Furthermore, shuttering our plant and impacting the lives of 500 Maine families will have no substantial impact on Maine's, America's or global greenhouse gas emissions.""\Kevin Miller can be contacted at 791-6312 or at:"
117,"Former Gov. Angus King is calling it a ""catastrophe"" and perhaps ""the most serious crisis ever to face the state of Maine.""\U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe warned recently that parts of Maine could ""become uninhabitable"" for some people this winter as the price of heating oil climbs ever higher.\Other Maine leaders are only slightly less gloomy, calling the coming heating season a ""crisis"" requiring immediate action from homeowners, state government and federal officials in Washington, D.C.\Record energy costs are pinching all Americans in the wallet. But Mainers could be among the nation's hardest-hit, especially if oil prices continue their trend.\Consider these alarming statistics:\. 80 percent of Maine households use heating oil, which is the highest percentage in the country.\. Nearly three-quarters of the electricity generated in Maine comes from oil or natural gas, which is also higher than both the New England and national averages.\. Mainers use more gasoline per capita than residents of every other state in the nation except two.\. Maine houses are on average among the oldest in the country.\""This isn't business as usual,"" King told attendees of a wind and tidal energy seminar recently. ""This is a disaster in the state of Maine that is coming at us ... This is a human catastrophe that is coming at us in terms of energy.""\In response, Maine must get creative and move quickly to bring renewable energy projects on line, King said. The outspoken former governor is most enthusiastic about wind energy and is a principal in a company, Independence Wind, that hopes to develop wind farms.\Several energy experts were more tempered than King in their assessments of Maine's energy situation. But they agreed that renewable energy sources offer the key to Maine and the nation becoming better insulated from the volatile fossil fuel market.\Stephen Connors, a longtime researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Laboratory for Energy and the Environment, said lessening Maine's dependence on oil unfortunately falls into the ""easier said than done"" category.\At present, most of the wind-energy facilities proposed for Maine have been located in rural, sparsely populated areas with good wind resources. Once you get away from those few areas, however, siting wind farms becomes more problematic both from a wind resource and public relations standpoint, Connors said.\He said there is the problem of Maine's aging electricity transmission system, which is not capable of handling output from additional industrial energy facilities. Two utilities, Central Maine Power and Maine Public Service Co., submitted applications last week to overhaul the state's transmission lines in part to accommodate large wind farms proposed for northern Maine.\Connors predicted it could be 2020 before wind energy can really ""take off"" as a major source of energy for the region. In the meantime, Maine and other states need to look at every possible energy source, including biomass and tidal facilities.\""We're going to need everything,"" said Connors, who directs MIT's Analysis Group for Regional Energy Alternatives. ""It's an all-hands-on-deck situation to address both weaning ourselves off of fossil fuels and climate change.""\University of Maine economist Jonathan Rubin said it is clear that the crisis will be extremely difficult in the short term for low-income individuals, the elderly and those in rural areas who must commute long distances.\But Rubin said over the long run, the state can reap significant benefits from the situation.\Homeowners will invest in energy efficiency and conservation. New-car buyers are already shifting toward gas-sipping vehicles, which will eventually filter down into the used-car market. And both of those trends are helpful in addressing climate change, Rubin said.\Another silver lining, Rubin said, is that as fossil fuel prices rise, renewable energy sources become more competitive. Maine, with its vast resources in terms of wind, tidal and forest resources, should be able to capitalize on the emerging market.\""I'm optimistic about the future, actually,"" Rubin said.\John Kerry, who heads Maine's Office of Energy Independence and Security, said the crisis underscores the need for a clear national energy policy.\In the meantime, Gov. John Baldacci has put together a task force to prepare for the coming heating season and find ways to fund programs for those in need. Possible funding sources include bonds, federal grants and revenues generated by Maine's participation in a regional cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases, Kerry said.\""We are not waiting for anybody; we are taking action on our own,"" Kerry said. ""We know that people are hurting.""\kmiller@bangordailynews.net\990-8250"
118,"There's something perfectly fitting about a U.N.-sponsored ""global warming"" conference, convened to tell the rest of us that our lifestyles are too extravagant, holding its meeting at one of the world's most luxurious resorts.\Ah, Cancun. Glorious beaches, balmy breezes, swank hotels, fine cuisine - our environmental watchdogs' nirvana.\At least, as The Washington Times pointed out in a recent editorial, this meeting won't end like last year's Copenhagen conference did - with delegates fleeing early to avoid an unexpected blizzard. Moving the next meeting much closer to the equator avoided that bad P.R. image, but YouTubed videos of the delegates partying it up this week didn't convey the aura of seriousness that the group's public pronouncements attempted to carry off.\Copenhagen's 15,000 delegates couldn't come up with a meaningful successor to the expiring 1997 Kyoto pact to limit carbon emissions, and, according to all forecasts, neither will Cancun.

Developed countries have finally added up the tab of slashing their economies to the output of decades ago, and it comes out reading ""poverty.""\And developing nations are too busy building coal- and oil-fired power plants to worry too much about what their customers abroad, who keep snapping up their products, think about how they produce them.\This is, admittedly, a different proposition from the question of whether the world is getting a bit warmer overall.\Indeed, it may be - but despite what you hear, there is no real scientific consensus on how much global average temperatures will rise, or for that matter whether the average will continue to rise at all.\It is also unknown whether the effects of moderately higher average temperatures, if they do occur, will be more harmful than beneficial (longer growing seasons, fewer deaths from cold weather, which kills more people than heat, etc.)\Blaming carbon dioxide, which is a weak greenhouse gas (water vapor, present in large amounts everywhere, is far more effective at trapping heat, and the effects of the sun's variability on climate are only beginning to be studied) is widely seen in skeptical circles as merely the intellectual left's newest attempt to assert control over the world's economic and political controls.\We are told this is ""the hottest summer on record"" without being told the records only go back 160 years. But other studies show the world was even warmer a millennium ago, when CO2 levels were lower.\Calls for reining in ""climate change"" seem tendentious when we know from history that the climate is always changing - and it cools far more often than it warms.\And it's become a cliche among skeptics - or, as they are otherwise known, realists - that it will be time to believe in global warming when the people who say it's happening start acting like they really believe their own claims.\That is, a conference called to discuss solutions to this computer-model-generated crisis attracted people from 192 countries flying in on CO2-emitting airplanes, and then living it up on their governments' tab in ways much of the idle rich could only hope to enjoy.\Speaking of the idle rich, Al Gore maintains two homes, one in Tennessee and one in Malibu, with the carbon footprint of a dozen average families. If he believed the oceans were rising more than the tiny amount they actually are, why would he buy a beachfront home?\And Gore's recent confession that his vote for subsidies for ethanol from crops was politically motivated and produced no net benefit for the environment (while raising food prices) was greatly underplayed.\Gore did say that ethanol from non-crop sources would be better, but the effects of the costly additive on gas mileage and small-engine longevity will still be detrimental.\The Cancun conference, which began Nov. 29 and is to run for two weeks (!), has already called for developed nations to cripple their economies via carbon reduction.\With the cap-and-trade bill dead in the water in Congress, and Gore's carbon-trading exchange, CCX, going out of business, that seems a tad unlikely for the United States, and most other developed nations are turning away, as well.\But newly elected Republicans aren't the only skeptics. This is a bipartisan effort, with many Midwestern Democrats looking askance at the job-killing effects of such legislation.\Sadly, our leaders continue to pay lip service to ""energy independence"" while acting in ways that make it impossible to achieve. The Environmental Protection Agency has been given the power by courts to regulate carbon, and will soon - unless stopped by Congress - begin to impose its own rules on U.S. businesses to implement its anti-growth ideology.\And President Obama, reversing an earlier pledge (now there's a phrase you hardly ever see), this week blocked oil drilling in many promising sections of our offshore waters.\The bottom line remains the same, however: Will citizens of free nations make their own decisions about their use of resources while seeking prosperity for themselves, their families and their nation?\Or will they give their freedom over to an unelected but politically well-connected scientific clerisy that claims to know how to run their lives?\Every day, there's more reason to believe the side of freedom might win this battle.\M.D. Harmon is an editorial writer.

119,"
An angry national electorate dissatisfied with the Democratic leadership it elected two years ago was poised Tuesday to complete a congressional purge to match forecasts of national pundits.
\
But Maine's two congressional Democrats appeared poised to withstand the GOP tide.
\
With several rural precincts left to be counted, U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud of Millinocket was the projected winner over Republican challenger Jason Levesque of Auburn.
\
At 10:30 p.m. CNN called Michaud the winner, 57 to 43 percent. Shortly thereafter, the Associated Press had called the race for Michaud.
\
Despite those results, Levesque emerged from his hotel room at 11 p.m. to say it was too early to concede.
\
""Only 20 percent of the ballots have been counted,"" he said. ""We don't concede until the ballots have been counted.""
\
He added, ""There's a lot of rural towns that haven't been counted and that's what we expected. This is going exactly the way we planned.""
\
According to unofficial results reported by the Bangor Daily News, Michaud led Republican challenger Jason Levesque 56 percent to 44 percent with just 23 percent of precincts reporting Tuesday night.
\
Michaud, reached at his campaign headquarters in Millinocket late Tuesday night, said he was pleased with the vote so far.
\
""It's been very heartwarming,"" he said. ""One of the things I kept hearing while campaigning was that voters were happy that I ran a positive campaign.""
\
He said his campaign contrasted sharply with Levesque's, who used ""talking points he was receiving from Washington D.C.""
\
""I ran on my record and my opponent tried to distort that record with language from Washington,"" Michaud said. ""Maine voters saw through that.""
\
Local unofficial results had Michaud carrying several towns, including Lewiston, Farmington, Bethel, Hanover, Mexico, Oxford, Poland, Gilead and Newry.
\
Levesque won Minot, Lincoln Plantation and Turner.
\
Levesque watched results at a party at the Hilton Garden Inn in Auburn Tuesday night. He appeared several times to talk with supporters, who anxiously awaited results.
\
Despite some early favorable results for Levesque, the challenger received a blow when Lewiston went to Michaud, 6,969 to 4,747.
\
Levesque emerged from his hotel room to tell the crowd he'd won Lincoln and Turner. His campaign told the crowd that Republican GOP gubernatorial candidate Paul LePage had won Lewiston, but didn't mention Levesque's loss there.
\
""Well, we won Lincoln and Turner,"" Levesque said. ""It's too early to tell.""
\
The GOP challenger ran a feisty campaign that attacked Michaud's votes on the national health care bill, stimulus spending, and the cap-and-trade bill. Levesque, following the playbook for other Republican congressional candidates, also sought to erode Michaud's Blue Dog image by linking him with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
\
In this election, Pelosi was toxic to incumbent Democrats, just as President George W. Bush was to sitting Republicans in 2008.
\
A Public Policy Poll released in September showed Levesque within seven points of Michaud, but subsequent surveys gave Michaud double-digit leads.
\
Michaud also benefited from a campaign war chest nearly twice the size of his challenger. Latest finance reports show the Democrat with nearly $1 million in campaign donations, much of it from labor and business political action committees.
\
Levesque, by contrast, had about $500,000 less than Michaud. Eighty-two percent of his funding came from individual donors.
\
The funding disparity appeared to hamper Levesque in the closing days of the campaign, forcing him to run Internet ads instead of TV spots.
\
Levesque campaigned almost the entire day in the Lewiston-Auburn region. Michaud campaigned here early before heading to his campaign headquarters in Millinocket.
\
This morning, a woman strode toward the entrance of the Multi-Purpose Center in Lewiston, where Michaud was campaigning.
\
""Hi Mike,"" she shouted.
\
Three heads turned in her direction.
\
One of them was Michaud's, who had propped open one of the entrance doors with his back. He juggled a cup of hot chocolate and a Blackberry, but managed to shakes hands with incoming voters.
\
A U.S. Army Reserve retired veteran walked out of the building and turned to Michaud saying, ""You got it. If I could have voted twice, I would have.""
\
A woman followed: ""Good luck, Mr. Michaud,"" she said.
\
Across the river, Levesque was walking into Happy Days Diner in New Auburn behind U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
\
Levesque, dressed in dark slacks, a blue dress shirt and red tie, introduced himself as a candidate for the 2nd Congressional District.
\
""I'd be honored to have your vote today,"" Levesque told the diners, explaining he was a husband, father and businessman who grew up in Auburn.
\
He said he hoped to work with Snowe to create the right environment for more jobs.
\
""I'd like to follow in her footsteps,"" Levesque said, pointing out that Snowe has held elective office for as long as he's been alive.
\
""I voted for you yesterday,"" said David Thibaudeau of Auburn, who sat eating eggs and a potato pancake.
\
Thibaudeau, 62, a registered Republican, said he was laid off from Poland Spring bottling. Tired of looking for work in a lousy job market, he decided to retire instead.

But while manufacturers welcomed the chance to participate in the proposed stakeholder discussions, they warned against setting unrealistic requirements on industries that have already dramatically reduced emissions.\DEP would develop plan to reach 80 percent cut\AUGUSTA — Maine scientists, fishermen and environmentalists urged lawmakers Wednesday to embrace a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent and begin work on a new “action plan” to address climate change.\But while manufacturers and energy producers welcomed the proposed discussions, they warned against setting unrealistic requirements on industries that have already dramatically reduced emissions.\“Before you set a limit on emissions and a timeline for that, first find out where you are,” said Tony Buxton, an attorney representing the Industrial Energy Consumers Group.\After years on the political back-burner, climate-related issues are once again on the policy agenda in Augusta. Democratic legislative leaders, who have majorities in both the Maine House and Senate, and Gov. Janet Mills have made it a top priority amid growing scientific evidence that climate change is already affecting Maine fisheries, farms and woodlands.\Lawmakers heard nearly seven hours of testimony Wednesday on two bills that would set a goal of reducing statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 or 2050. Both measures, as well as a third bill, would also direct the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to update the state’s 15-year-old “climate action plan” that offered strategies for reducing emissions to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.\None of the bills specify how the state would achieve those additional reductions but, instead, would rely on the Maine DEP to craft regulations with input from a diverse set of interests. But supporters said a new road map is needed for Maine to achieve its share of the goals established by the 2015 international Paris Climate Agreement and embraced by the Mills administration.\“We have met the goals we set in 2003 and 2004 for 2020, but perhaps that was just low-hanging fruit,” said Rep. Ralph Tucker, D-Brunswick, sponsor of the bill to reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050. “But I am convinced that, if we really try, we can rise to the occasion and continue the remarkable progress we have made so far.”\A DEP official called an 80 percent reduction by 2050 “appropriate” and said the goal — along with an update to the 2004 climate action plan — will be “fully embodied” in a forthcoming bill from the governor’s office.\“The department agrees that policymakers and stakeholders should undertake the work described in these bills, but we recommend it be done by work groups of the governor’s Climate Council,” said Melanie Loyzim, deputy commissioner at the DEP.\South Thomaston lobsterman David Cousens said while climate change has likely contributed to the five-fold increase in lobster landings, he believes “we’re at the tipping point now” as water temperature rises and invasive species move in. Cousens said he worries whether his sons will be able to continue lobstering as populations of the iconic crustacean creep farther up the coast into cooler Canadian waters.\The former Maine Lobstermen’s Association president also took a swipe at President Donald Trump’s repeated claims that climate change is a hoax driven by “fake science.”\“I don’t know what ‘fake science’ is, but I know when I was in high school or college, we based all of our information on science,” Cousens told members of the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee. “I believe that 99 percent of the scientists in the world are right, and the 1 percent that says it’s a hoax are not.”\Recent research has shown that the Gulf of Maine is warming faster than almost anywhere else in the earth’s oceans.\Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, pointed to the loss of the lobster fisheries in Rhode Island and southern New England to show that “there is only so much warming that lobsters can take.” \Pressed by a lawmaker on Maine’s tiny contribution to global climate emissions, Pershing described climate change as “the ultimate tragedy of the commons” that will require contributions from everyone, large and small.\“You need to have leadership, and you need to have very clear goals, and that’s what I am most excited about with this bill,” Pershing said.\Maine has made significant progress over the past 15 years in reducing some greenhouse gas emissions but not in all sectors, falling behind in transportation.\Power plants and large, industrial facilities such as paper mills reduced emissions by 73 percent between 2002 and 2015, in part by switching from oil to natural gas. Maine’s participation in the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative — the nation’s first cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions — has also encouraged efficiencies while generating hundreds of millions of dollars for equipment upgrades and home weatherization.\Emissions from cars, trucks, planes and other components of the transportation sector remained flat during that time, however, and accounted for 52 percent of all emissions in Maine in 2015.\Manufacturers and representatives from energy-intensive industries urged lawmakers to remember their dramatic reductions when setting future goals. Simply imposing a further 80 percent reduction in industrial emissions, they warned, could have cataclysmic impacts on those companies.\“Please don’t ask us to do more until other sources have done similar levels” of reductions, said Scott Beal, environmental security manager for Woodland Pulp in Baileyville, which spent $16 million to switch to natural gas.\The most foreboding comments came from Michael Martunas, environmental compliance manager at Dragon Products Company, a Thomaston cement manufacturing plant with 107 employees.\Martunas warned that an 80 percent reduction is simply unachievable because greenhouse gases are emitted by the components of concrete, not as a result of fossil fuel combustion for energy. But Americans will still need to buy cement from somewhere, even if Dragon goes out of business.\“If either bill is enacted, our cement plant will close and approximately 500 jobs supported by the plant will either cease to exist or lose revenue provided by Dragon,” Martunas said. “Furthermore, shuttering our plant and impacting the lives of 500 Maine families will have no substantial impact on Maine’s, America’s or global greenhouse gas emissions.”\Kevin Miller — 791-6312\kmiller@mainetoday.com\Twitter: KevinMillerPPH "

122,"At least 2,000 Maine homeowners have sunk thousands of dollars into solar power arrays. Part of their calculation in making the purchase is the ability to sell excess power back to the grid, called net metering.\That means their electricity meters can reverse during times when their system generates more power than they use at home. The power companies pay them for it, and the savings help solar customers recover the cost of the equipment faster.\It's only fair that they get paid something for their power, right? But the question is how much.\Maine's now taking on a debate playing out across the country over how to value that power, how to adapt the simplistic incentive of net metering to a maturing market, and whether it's fair to change the game on existing customers.\(For the basics on net metering, and how it affects everyone's power bill, read this.)\The stakes for solar in Maine are small, but growing.\A report issued last week by Environment Maine shows that solar capacity in Maine lags much of the country and the region. But it's clear that the industry's momentum is at stake.\According to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Maine's small-scale solar capacity rose 63 percent in the last year, compared with about 42 percent across New England. Only Rhode Island had a lower estimate of small solar capacity, at about 11 megawatts, to Maine's 16.1 megawatts.\Maine outpaced the region and country for the amount of solar it generated in the past year, although the state's relatively low capacity makes it easier to grow quickly.\After a law to replace net metering with new incentives failed, solar installers say keeping net metering is crucial to maintaining that growth.\Some say net metering customers are paid too little.\One study, updated last week, showed that a solar installation generating power for 25 years would deliver a value of 27.2 cents per kilowatt-hour back to the grid. That includes all of the avoided costs of building transmission lines and the environmental benefits of reducing emissions.\Maine solar installer ReVision Energy argued that net metered solar customers are actually getting paid too little, with residential customers getting around 13 cents per kilowatt-hour and small commercial customers getting less than 12 cents per kilowatt-hour.\In comments to the PUC, ReVision Energy wrote that net metering ""is not perfect, but it provides ' rough justice'"" for the value small solar generators provide to the grid.\[documentcloud url=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2997908-Revision-Energy-NEB-Comments/annotations/310411.html""]\Others argue that net metering customers are paid too much.\Prices for solar installations continue to fall, but they still cost the typical homeowner more than $15,000. Not everyone can afford that.\The Dirigo Electric Cooperative criticized net metering as ""a reverse Robin Hood program, taking from those who cannot afford self-generation to give to those who can,"" in a 2008 case cited in comments by the Governor's Energy Office.\Central Maine Power Co., in its comments, advanced the idea, writing that the commission's review of net metering should ""address the inappropriate subsidization between net energy billing customers and other utility customers.""\And the Maine Public Advocate's Office has argued that state and federal solar policy largely limits the benefits to landowners with high federal tax liability. In other words, the well-to-do.\The federal tax credit for solar installations does not come to taxpayers as a cash rebate, but instead discounts any existing tax liability. The Public Advocate's Office wrote that then ""requires that customers have sufficient tax liability to realize this benefit.""\""If all customers bear the costs of the program, all customers should have the opportunity to participate and obtain those benefits,"" the Public Advocate wrote.\There's no way for renters to benefit from net metered systems either.\But the solar industry and others argue that doesn't mean net metering should go away for the relatively small group that has it now and counted on it to help recover their investment in the equipment.\Net metering customers worry that what happened in Vegas won't stay in Vegas.\In Nevada, things got heated when regulators changed the rates of about 17,000 solar customers who had installed the photovoltaic systems.\The case rankled entrepreneur Elon Musk's SolarCity and installer SunRun, leading to a lawsuit, a November ballot initiative and calls for a special session of the legislature.\The fate for existing customers poses a lingering question in Maine as well. National and local solar installers want customers to be grandfathered into current net metering rates ""in perpetuity.""\But utilities and the Governor's Energy Office have argued those customers should eventually transition away from their current arrangements, being grandfathered for no more than three years.\That prompted sharp criticism from Assistant House Majority Leader Sara Gideon of Freeport, who called the governor's suggestion a ""reckless, ill-conceived plan."" Gideon sponsored a solar policy bill last session that proposed a successor to net metering and would have grandfathered existing customers for 12 years.\The Office of the Public Advocate, which represents ratepayers, suggested grandfathering current net metering customers for 10 years from the start of the operation of their solar systems.\CMP and Emera Maine said they were not opposed to grandfathering current customers, with CMP suggesting that around 10 years would be appropriate for customers to get a payback on their initial investment.\Environmental advocates echoed the solar industry, arguing that current customers should keep their net billing arrangements for the life of their existing solar installations.\""In the event that changes are proposed, it would be massively disruptive, legally questionable and virtually unprecedented to change net metering rules for existing customers,"" the Conservation Law Foundation wrote.\Now the issue is in the hands of regulators.\Public Advocate Tim Schneider led a compromise last year among utilities, solar installers, his office and others to give small solar generators access to long-term contracts. The proposal promised to keep solar adoption on track for growth projected under net metering, while introducing some market dynamics into the pricing.\The system would have set up a ""standard buyer"" for solar power -- likely the utilities -- that would solicit bids and could enter long-term contracts with certain solar generators, grouped by size. The utilities would aggregate renewable energy credits for each megawatt those customers generated, selling that into the regional cap-and-trade program and using those proceeds to defray costs for all electricity customers.\That plan's failure landed the solar policy back in the laps of regulators. They will now play referee and consider whether they, without the Legislature, can or should dust off the compromise plan and enact it themselves.\Credit: Darren Fishell BDN Staff"

\
- Gov. Paul LePage, 2013 state of the state address
\
The high cost of energy in Maine has been one of the most consistent themes from the governor -- and one of the hardest to do much about, so far.
\
When LePage came into office, the overall cost of electricity in the state was 31 percent above the national average, according to federal statistics quoted by the LePage administration. Two years into the LePage administration, things had improved a bit -- the state was 24 percent above the national average and 12th highest in the country.
\
The improvement was due to a decrease in the price of natural gas in New England, from which electricity prices are set.
\
""We were lucky,"" admitted Patrick Woodcock, the head of the LePage energy office.
\
But luck will only get you so far, and Woodcock said those prices are starting to tick up.
\
LePage's approach to more permanent solutions reveals -- once again -- his philosophical differences with the once-prevalent thinking in state government.
\
Democrats have generally come at the energy issue from a policy angle, stressing the environment. Thus, Gov. John Baldacci's efforts to make Maine a major producer of wind power, a strategy that is still being debated.
\
LePage comes at it from the point of view of the consumer, the family spending too much to heat their home and the businessman who pays more for electricity than competitors.
\
He has been a cheerleader for the expansion of natural gas in Maine, including converting many state buildings to the cheaper fuel. And much of greater Augusta is being torn up right now to lay gas pipelines to business and homes.
\
Woodcock said LePage's early support of natural gas ""was controversial at the time. The inherent market was oil and those businesses were really opposed to the initiative.""
\
Woodcock credits LePage's appointments to the Public Utilities Commission for making a change in regulations that includes a $1,200 rebate to convert a home to natural gas use. ""That's been driving this growth,"" Woodcock said.
\
He cites another innovation by LePage that will help homeowners deal with the cost of keeping their homes warm that required the governor to modify his conservative opposition to the cap-and-trade plan known as RGGI.
\
Now, about $9 million of the $40 million RGGI funds will go to the Efficiency Maine Trust, a quasi-state agency, to help homeowners modernize their heating systems.
\
Steve Ward is the former state public advocate, a position created to represent consumers before the Public Utilities Commission (he held the position for 20 years) and is currently chair of the Maine Center for Economic Policy, a progressive think thank and advocacy group based in Augusta.
\
He said, ""If the LePage administration played any important role in stimulating the second round of gas infrastructure build-out that we are now witnessing, they had a great deal of company: big paper companies and their lawyers, entrepreneurial gas developers like Summit and many (but not all) environmental organizations in Maine.""
\
Woodcock agreed that business interests played a major role.
\
Ward supports the new use of the RGGI funds because they will be used ""for converting obsolete and dangerous furnaces in low-income homes to cheaper and cleaner fuels ...""
\
But he added that the RGGI money was part of the omnibus energy bill that LePage vetoed (the veto was overridden). ""The most positive achievement"" of the Act, Ward said, was to give authority over funding for the Efficiency Maine's programs to the professionals at the PUC and not the Legislature, where it is subject to ""political maneuvering.""
\
The chief reason for LePage's opposition to the bill was that it did not scale back the state's ambitious wind power goals, which, he has said, give wind an unfair advantage over other forms of energy. At one point, he said he would support the Act if the Legislature gave him what he wanted about an offshore wind project.
\
The PUC had approved a $120 million deal with Statoil of Norway to test large scale floating wind turbines off Boothbay. LePage thought the deal was bad for consumers because it would pay the company above-market rates for the power and also because he wanted the University of Maine to be allowed to bid -- well after the bids had been closed.
\
In the end, LePage vetoed the energy bill but got his way with the offshore wind contract and the UMaine wind project will now be considered by the PUC.
\
Critics claim forcing the PUC to go back on the Statoil agreement was not ""business-friendly"" -- one of LePage's go-to themes.
\
LePage admitted in the May interview, ""We're trying to get Statoil out ... they're a Norwegian company that comes to Maine, they get a contract to go deep offshore, deep water windmills, with no guarantees of creating jobs in Maine, no guarantees of anything. If it works we'll create jobs, is what they said. We've had the University of Maine since 1865. They're a land grant school, they're a pretty good organization, I'm an alumnus, I like this university; they are working on deepwater windmills, but they're not allowed to bid on this contract because Statoil is in before"" the university was ready to bid.

124,"CUTTING CARBON HERE ARE top five tips for cutting carbon dioxide emissions in homes and small businesses. 1. Buy electricity generated from renewable sources. 2. Install compact fluorescent lightbulbs. 3. Turn down thermostats two degrees. 4. Keep car tires properly inflated and engine maintained. 5. Set electric and gas water heaters at 120 degrees or below. TO LEARN MORE: www.energymaine.com www.stopglobalwarming.orgMaine's hardwood forest will slowly be replaced by the end of this century with species now commonly found in more southern regions, according to global climate models referenced by the Maine Forest Service and other sources. TREES AND THE CARBON CYCLE MAINE'S FORESTS could play a role in reducing the impacts of global climate change because of the ability of trees to absorb carbon dioxide. Heres how the process works: CARBON EXISTS in the atmosphere primarily in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). CARBON IS the basic element in all living organisms. Plants and trees extract CO2 from the atmosphere and, through photosynthesis, use the carbon to grow and maintain life functions. PLANTS AND TREES release CO2 back into the atmosphere, creating - with the intake and respiration of oceans - a global carbon cycle. Not all carbon is returned to the air. Trees, plants and soil remove and store an estimated 60 billion tons of carbon a year. LEFT UNDISTURBED, the cycle is a balanced one. But the burning of fossil fuels - stored carbon - releases more CO2 into the atmosphere than the system is capable of processing. Deforestation contributes to this overload because as more carbon is dumped into the atmosphere, there are fewer trees to remove and store it. - Julia McCue, staff researcher SOURCE: Pew Center on Global Climate Change, EPA\ J.D. Irving Ltd. is Maine's largest private landowner, with 1.3 million acres in Aroostook County. Foresters manage its land primarily for spruce-fir sawlogs, as well as paper mill pulp and power plant fuel.\ Now the Canadian-based company is exploring another potential value for those forests that could be worth millions of dollars - carbon dioxide storage.\ Irving is supporting carbon storage as part of plans to establish a Northeast regional program that would cap how much CO2 power plants can emit. To exceed the limits, plants could buy credits from landowners that manage trees in ways that store additional amounts of carbon. That would give forest owners additional financial value from their land.\ ""The land will have all the same values for the company,"" said Bill Borland, Irving's director of environmental affairs. ""But while we're growing for that, we'll be receiving credits each year for absorbing carbon.""\ Irving's interest in carbon storage is an early example of how Maine's forest-products industry hopes to position itself to cope with global climate change. It's notable because the topic is just beginning to get serious attention from most forest-dependent businesses in the state.\ A warmer, drier world in the 21st century will bring with it changes in tree species, researchers say, transforming Maine's northern forest into a landscape that today s found in southern New England and the Middle Atlantic states. That's bound to be disruptive, in a state that's 90 percent woodland and has long relied on the northern forest as a foundation of its economy.\ A few examples: Maple sugar businesses could dry up over the next 50 years, as the familiar hardwood stands of maple and birch in western Maine give way to oak and hickory.\ Sawmills in York and Cumberland counties could scramble for high- value white pine, as the species is replaced by loblolly and southern pines.\ Paper and lumber mills that depend on the vast spruce-fir resource of northern and eastern Maine would have to adapt to a forest of oak and pine.\ Climate change, though, can also bring opportunity for business.\ Forest owners may find new values by keeping CO2, the prime greenhouse gas associated with climate change, out of the atmosphere. They also may become a source of fuels that replace oil- based compounds, and be rewarded when wood is substituted for more energy-intensive products, such as steel building materials.\ ""We're hoping that eventually the markets will mature not only for storage, but for increasing productivity,"" said Alec Giffen, director of the Maine Forest Service. ""That's where the real payoff is.""\ Giffen spoke last week about carbon markets and sustainable forestry, at a conference in New Hampshire on how climate change could affect the working forest in that state. Other Maine speakers included Eric Kingsley, vice president of Innovative Natural Resources in Portland, who outlined the economic impacts of climate change on New Hampshire's forests; and Stephen Shaler, associate director of the Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Center at the University of Maine, who discussed the potential for new products and fuels from wood.\ Giffen's agency has joined with the U.S. Forest Service and Environment Northeast, a regional advocacy group, to study the potential for northern hardwood forests to store more carbon through various management practices. They have determined that thinning trees prior to harvest - taking out dead or decaying limbs, for instance - creates a forest stand that stores more carbon than traditional harvesting methods.\ The added carbon storage and the sustainable forestry behind it, they say, should have a dollar value. It's a case that Giffen's agency, Irving and others are making as Northeast states work to set up the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a market where carbon credits would be traded on a per-ton basis. A so-called cap and trade emissions market already exists in the European Union.\ With 17 million acres of forest, Maine may be able to capitalize on its carbon storing capacity. That opportunity would have been impossible a century ago, when much of the land south of Bangor was cleared for farming.\ In heavily forested New Brunswick, where Irving has its largest holdings, Borland estimates that carbon credits could be worth $25 million in some future trading market, based on sustainable management practices.\ ""Healthier trees give you the biggest bang for your buck,"" Borland said. ""You're getting a lot more carbon sequestered in an acre of land.""\ Carbon caps cut both ways for Irving, a diversified company that's also trying to build a second oil refinery in Saint John, New Brunswick. Strict greenhouse gas emission limits in Canada could kill the project, the company said last month.\ And while disputes over carbon caps and the human contributions to global warming make headlines, the connection between changing climate and changing woodland is hardly new.\ Researchers at the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine have documented the shift in tree species since the last ice age, 10,000 years ago. They have created maps that show how spruce - so common now in northern Maine - were confined largely to Canada 1,000 years ago, when the weather was warmer and drier.\ The global climate is moving in that direction again, perhaps at a faster rate. It didn't matter 1,000 years ago, but it does now.\ Take eastern white pine. Common and valuable enough to be Maine's official state tree, it supports many sawmills and small landowners, especially in southern Maine. What if it becomes less prevalent?\ ""It's a concern,"" said Terry Walters, production manager at the Lavalley Lumber sawmill in Sanford. ""But there's not much discussion because in the short term, there's not much we can do about it.""\ Walters is a board member of the Small Woodlot Owners Association of Maine. His more-immediate worry is keeping white pine forests, which tend to occur on well-drained soil, from being developed for house lots.\ Walters attended last week's conference in New Hampshire, however. His company wants to stay informed about climate change, he said, even if it's too early to know how to respond.\ For some forest enterprises, there's no clear way to react to climate change. That may help explain why interest in the topic is only now emerging in the industry.\ For example: Maple sugar generates an average of $6 million in sales each year in Maine. While not a major industry, maple products are part of the identity of northern New England and viewed as a rite of spring.\ ""People connect with it differently than with a sawmill,"" said Kingsley at Innovative Natural Resource Solutions. ""They connect with it at their breakfast table.""\ Kingsley outlined a gloomy future for maple products in New Hampshire. The decline in maple trees, he predicted, would basically eliminate the industry within 50 years. The direct economic loss would total $1.8 billion in the 21st century.\ New Hampshire is a distant third in New England maple sugar production, well behind Vermont and Maine. So the impact in Maine would be greater. But Jeremy Steeves, secretary treasurer of the 150- member Maine Maple Producers Association, said climate change hasn't generated much discussion in the state's sugar houses.\ Steeves, who taps 450 acres of maple at Strawberry Hill Farms in Skowhegan, said his review of 100 years of records suggests only seasonal fluctuations in sap flow and timing. He's not worried about losing Maine's maple stands, at least not over the next generation.\ ""Personally,"" he said, ""there's not much we can do about it.""\ Staff writer Tux Turkel can be contacted at 791-6462 or\ tturkel@pressherald.com"
125,"on climate\fades in\Trump era\Editor's Note: Inside Climate News is a web-based, nonpartisan, nonprofit news organization that won a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 2013 for its stories on lax regulation of the nation's oil pipelines. This is one of a series of stories from ICN examining the positions and climate policy records of candidates in key U.S. Senate elections.\Eighteen years ago, Sen. Susan Collins stood with eight other GOP senators to block President George W. Bush's plan to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. To let the oil companies in, Collins said, ""would be akin to wasting resources that should rightfully be there for future generations.""\But in 2017, while voicing misgivings, she voted to open the pristine wilderness area to oil exploration as part of President Trump's big tax cut bill, which she supported.\That vote began the unraveling of the environmental community's longstanding support for Collins.\Now, large membership groups like the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club are lined up against Collins in what is turning out to be a difficult bid for a fifth term in office. She has been trailing in polls behind Democratic challenger and Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon.\Collins has the strongest pro-environment voting record in the Congressional GOP, and is one of the few party leaders who has consistently accepted the science on humanity's role in climate change.\But the green groups, like several progressive and women's organizations that have abandoned Collins, such as Planned Parenthood, the Human Rights Campaign and Emily's List, say her support for Trump and his agenda have made it impossible for them to back her.\""We needed senators, especially Republican senators, to stand up to the Trump administration, the most anti-environmental administration ever,"" said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs for the League of Conservation Voters. ""Unfortunately, on far too many occasions, when we really needed Sen. Collins' support, she wasn't there.""\Trump put Collins in tough spot\Collins' decision-making in the Trump era - often airing doubts but ultimately throwing her support behind the president - has become the stuff of ""Saturday Night Live"" satire. After prolonged reflection, she supported Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation and Trump's impeachment acquittal.\Those high-profile votes spurred Democrats around the country to contribute money for Collins' defeat. As a result, Gideon has raised $23 million, outpacing Collins' $16 million haul, and making it the most expensive U.S. Senate race in Maine history.\James Melcher, a political science professor at the University of Maine at Farmington, said that Collins' political future would have been equally shaky if she had broken from the Republican Party on the key votes.\""Donald Trump has repeatedly put her in situations where she cannot win,"" Melcher said. As it was, Collins' vote for Kavanaugh helped tamp down a potential primary challenge from the right, possibly by then-Gov. Paul LePage, who had twice proven he could win statewide office in Maine.\Collins can fairly argue that her environmental voting record hasn't changed much under Trump - her score on the League of Conservation Voters scorecard now hovers near her lifetime average of 61 percent, substantially higher than that of any other current Republican Senate candidate. She voted against both Scott Pruitt and Andrew Wheeler when Trump nominated them to head the Environmental Protection Agency and opposed the rollback of the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan. But she supported many other Trump nominees opposed by environmentalists, including Kavanaugh, who has a record of skepticism about federal authority to regulate greenhouse gases.\In fact, Collins' environmental voting record has see-sawed. She previously won the LCV's endorsement both in 2008, when she was one of just three senators with a perfect 100 percent on the league's scorecard, and in 2014, when she scored zero, casting votes in support of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and against clean energy tax credits.\Collins' supporters argue her record reflects that she is not beholden to party or ideology. ""Despite which party controls the White House, Senator Collins has always taken a pragmatic, thoughtful approach to our climate - and has always sought to find common ground and forge compromise rather than focus on what might divide us,"" Kevin Kelley, her campaign spokesman, said in an email.\Early in the Obama administration, Collins and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., co-sponsored ""cap-and-dividend"" legislation as an alternative to the ""cap-and-trade"" bill then foundering in the Senate. It would have put a price on carbon, but less directly than a tax, while distributing the revenue in ""dividend"" checks to citizens to help offset increased energy costs.\But no big climate program ever made it through the Senate in the Obama years. And with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., firmly opposed to economy-wide climate legislation, Collins has not pushed further. She did not sign on to a ""cap-and-dividend"" measure now before Congress that is similar to her own 2010 bill.\In the current Congress, Collins has co-sponsored bills prohibiting withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, calling on Congress and the president to act on climate, and supporting regional greenhouse gas reduction programs. All were dead on arrival in McConnell's Senate.\She is one of seven Republicans in the bipartisan Senate Climate Solutions Caucus, but the group lacks the cohesiveness or clout of the Republican environmentalist bloc that Collins joined in 2002 to block Arctic drilling. Before her vote for Trump's 2017 tax bill, Collins was the lone Senate Republican to join a failed effort to strip Arctic drilling from the package.\""I honestly don't think she's changed that much"" from her voting record in the past, Melcher said. ""It's just that the Trump presidency has made it a lot harder for her brand of bipartisanship to work well.""\Gideon has energized environmental voters\Gideon has something that no previous Democratic challenger to Collins has been able to bring to the race: a serious chance of winning. She is far better funded than the Democrats in the last two lopsided contests, each of which Collins won by more than 30 points. And several recent independent polls show Gideon running about 5 percentage points ahead of Collins.\Last year, Gideon helped shepherd a big package of climate and clean energy bills through the Legislature with bipartisan support. If elected, Gideon said she would push legislation to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and fight to undo Trump's regulatory rollbacks.\""Investing in renewable energy and moving towards a carbon neutral future will help combat some of the threats to Maine's key industries like warming waters, ocean acidification and drought,"" Gideon said, in announcing her climate plan.\Collins has attacked Gideon for co-sponsoring a carbon fee-and-dividend bill that never made it through the Legislature last year. ""Maine workers can't afford Sara Gideon,"" said one of Collins' ads, asserting that the bill Gideon supported would have raised the cost of fuel by 40 cents per gallon. In fact, the carbon fee that Gideon backed would have started at just 4 cents a gallon, and revenue would have been returned to Maine citizens in dividend checks. The cap-and-dividend plan that Collins herself co-sponsored in Congress a decade ago took much the same approach.\In any case, Gideon's current climate plan doesn't include carbon fees.\Gideon defeated two progressive supporters of the Green New Deal in the Maine Democratic primary, and she neither endorses nor criticizes that idea. In an interview with Bustle, a lifestyle-oriented web publication that caters to young women, she said the Green New Deal is about ""facing the challenges that we have today in a forward-looking way.""\There's an additional element of uncertainty in the Maine Senate race because of the ranked-choice voting process the state adopted in 2016, which adds a degree of uncertainty to the Senate race.\Under the system, voters have the option of ranking candidates in their order of preference in races with three or more contenders. If no candidate receives more than 50 percent on the first tally, the candidate at the bottom is eliminated and their supporters' votes are given to whoever those voters marked as their second choice. That process continues until one candidate wins the majority of the remaining vote pool.\The two independent candidates in the race both are running on energy and climate issues: Max Linn, a financial planner from Bar Harbor, whose signature issue is opposition to Central Maine Power's hydropower transmission line from Canada; and Lisa Savage, an activist, former teacher and Green Party member who is running as an independent and embraces the Green New Deal.\Collins has a relatively strong climate record, if viewed in isolation. But senators don't operate in isolation, and with Trump in the White House and McConnell the majority leader in the Senate, Collins has not been in a position to make much difference on climate, even if she accepts the science.\Gideon's work turning climate legislation into law in Maine means she knows the issues as well as the political pitfalls. That's just icing on the cake for many environmentalists, who are inclined to support any Democratic challenger to Collins to help tip the Senate into Democratic control and wrest it from McConnell's hands."

The vote, on March 30, was 390 yeas to 6 nays.\YEAS: Michaud, Pingree\Vote 3: Dextromethorphan Distribution Act: The House approved the Dextromethorphan Distribution Act (HR 1259), sponsored by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., to restrict the sale of dextromethorphan, the active ingredient in most over-the-counter cough and cold medicines, to businesses registered with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Supporters said that when abused, the drug ""can cause brain damage, seizures, and even death,"" and so the bill was needed to ensure ""that DXM is used only for legitimate purposes and stays out of the hands of drug dealers and adolescents."" The vote, on March 31, was 407 yeas to 8 nays.\YEAS: Michaud, Pingree\Vote 4: Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act: The House approved Senate amendments to the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act (HR 1388), sponsored by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., to reauthorize national service laws. Supporters said the bill ""will build a national infrastructure for service and volunteerism"" and will increase ""national service participation while providing much-needed streamlining to reduce administrative burdens."" Opponents said ""the removal of important provisions"" from the bill meant its amended version failed to prevent the waste of taxpayer funds. The vote, on March 31, was 275 yeas to 149 nays.\YEAS: Michaud, Pingree\Vote 5: Vision Care for Kids Act: The House approved the Vision Care for Kids Act (HR 577), sponsored by Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, to provide Health and Human Services grants to states for eye exams and the treatment of eye problems in children. Supporters said the bill will ""provide follow-up vision care for children with vision disorders,"" preventing ""irreversible damage that can hinder a child's normal growth, development and opportunity to succeed."" The vote, on March 31, was 404 yeas to 17 nays.\YEAS: Michaud, Pingree\Vote 6: Disclosing Health Insurance Limitations: The House approved the Health Insurance Restrictions and Limitations Clarification Act of 2009 (HR 1253), sponsored by Rep.

The vote, on March 31, was 422 yeas to 3 nays.\YEAS: Michaud, Pingree\Vote 7: Act to Recover Bonuses: The House rejected the End Government Reimbursement of Excessive Executive Disbursements (HR 1575), sponsored by Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., which would have authorized the attorney general to pursue the recovery of bonuses paid to employees at companies receiving bailout funds from the federal government. Supporters said the bill would prevent companies using funds ""to supposedly save them from bankruptcy"" to instead pay ""outrageous bonuses"" to their employees. Opponents argued that ""bonuses that Congress and the president specifically ratified"" were not fraudulent and that the bill would be ""an unconstitutional taking of contractual rights."" The vote, on April 1, was 223 yeas to 196 nays.\YEAS: Michaud, Pingree\Vote 8: Pay for Performance Act: The House passed the Pay for Performance Act (HR 1664), sponsored by Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., to establish new performance standards to compensate employees at companies receiving federal funds under the Troubled Assets Relief Program. Supporters said the bill created ""commonsense restrictions"" on employee pay to ensure that it was not ""excessive or unreasonable."" Opponents protested assigning authority for the government to determine ""reasonable compensation"" and warned that it was expanding ""the control of the federal government into not only the private sector but into all aspects of our lives."" The vote, on April 1, was 247 yeas to 171 nays.\YEAS: Michaud, Pingree\Vote 9: Act for Smoking Prevention: The House has passed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (HR 1256), sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., to provide the Food and Drug Administration with the authority to regulate tobacco products in the interest of public health. Proponents noted that the legislation ""would require cigarette manufacturers to print warning labels with text warnings detailing the smoking-related diseases such as lung, heart, or mouth cancer,"" as a deterrent. Opponents said bill was merely a ""feel good"" bill that wouldn't help people quit smoking and wouldn't do much more than make government bigger, saying, ""an already dysfunctional and overburdened FDA will become even more distracted by this new Big Government program."" The vote, on April 2, was 298 yeas to 112 nays.\YEAS: Michaud, Pingree\Vote 10: House Passes Budget for 2010: The House has passed the federal budget resolution (HConRes 85), sponsored by Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., that will establish a congressional budget for the federal government for fiscal 2010. The resolution also included budgetary levels for fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2011-14. Proponents noted it was the duty of Congress to honor the promises made to Americans to support health care reform, energy independence and education by moving away from past failed policies. Opponents said that Democrats ""failed to recognize that the tax burden, with this energy tax imposed on any family that turns the light switch on, is going to be overwhelmingly strong.""

Supporters said the amendment would ""highlight and make it clear to the American public"" the amount of debt being incurred and the associated risk to the U.S. going forward.

Supporters said the amendment would ""ensure that nothing we have done so far here will allow health care in the United States to be rationed by the federal government."" Opponents said the research only attempted to determine ""the treatment regimes that are most effective at treating different disease states,"" and therefore the amendment was not needed. The vote, on April 1, was 44 yeas to 54 nays.\YEAS: Collins, Snowe\Vote 7: Senate passes budget for Fiscal 2010: The Senate has passed the federal budget resolution (SConRes 13) sponsored by Sen.

Proponents noted that, despite Republican remarks to the contrary, the budget would reduce the national deficit by two-thirds during its five-year term and that it extended middle-class tax relief items such as the child tax credit, the marriage penalty relief and education incentives. Opponents worried about the spending allowed for in the budget which they noted would actually triple the national debt despite other measure that would seem to reduce it.

Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., co-sponsored “cap-and-dividend” legislation as an alternative to the “cap-and-trade” bill then foundering in the Senate. It would have put a price on carbon, but less directly than a tax, while distributing the revenue in “dividend” checks to citizens to help offset increased energy costs.\But no big climate program ever made it through the Senate in the Obama years. And with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., firmly opposed to economy-wide climate legislation, Collins has not pushed further. She did not sign on to a “cap-and-dividend” measure now before Congress that is similar to her own 2010 bill.\In the current Congress, Collins has co-sponsored bills prohibiting withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, calling on Congress and the president to act on climate, and supporting regional greenhouse gas reduction programs. All were dead on arrival in McConnell’s Senate.\She is one of seven Republicans in the bipartisan Senate Climate Solutions Caucus, but the group lacks the cohesiveness or clout of the Republican environmentalist bloc that Collins joined in 2002 to block Arctic drilling. Before her vote for Trump’s 2017 tax bill, Collins was the lone Senate Republican to join a failed effort to strip Arctic drilling from the package.\“I honestly don’t think she’s changed that much” from her voting record in the past, Melcher said. “It’s just that the Trump presidency has made it a lot harder for her brand of bipartisanship to work well.”\Gideon has energized environmental voters\Gideon has something that no previous Democratic challenger to Collins has been able to bring to the race: a serious chance of winning. She is far better funded than the Democrats in the last two lopsided contests, each of which Collins won by more than 30 points. And several recent independent polls show Gideon running about 5 percentage points ahead of Collins.\Last year, Gideon helped shepherd a big package of climate and clean energy bills through the Legislature with bipartisan support. If elected, Gideon said she would push legislation to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and fight to undo Trump’s regulatory rollbacks.\“Investing in renewable energy and moving towards a carbon neutral future will help combat some of the threats to Maine’s key industries like warming waters, ocean acidification and drought,” Gideon said, in announcing her climate plan.\Collins has attacked Gideon for co-sponsoring a carbon fee-and-dividend bill that never made it through the Legislature last year. “Maine workers can’t afford Sara Gideon,” said one of Collins’ ads, asserting that the bill Gideon supported would have raised the cost of fuel by 40 cents per gallon. In fact, the carbon fee that Gideon backed would have started at just 4 cents a gallon, and revenue would have been returned to Maine citizens in dividend checks. The cap-and-dividend plan that Collins herself co-sponsored in Congress a decade ago took much the same approach.\In any case, Gideon’s current climate plan doesn’t include carbon fees.\Gideon defeated two progressive supporters of the Green New Deal in the Maine Democratic primary, and she neither endorses nor criticizes that idea. In an interview with Bustle, a lifestyle-oriented web publication that caters to young women, she said the Green New Deal is about “facing the challenges that we have today in a forward-looking way.”\There’s an additional element of uncertainty in the Maine Senate race because of the ranked-choice voting process the state adopted in 2016, which adds a degree of uncertainty to the Senate race.\Under the system, voters have the option of ranking candidates in their order of preference in races with three or more contenders. If no candidate receives more than 50 percent on the first tally, the candidate at the bottom is eliminated and their supporters’ votes are given to whoever those voters marked as their second choice. That process continues until one candidate wins the majority of the remaining vote pool.\The two independent candidates in the race both are running on energy and climate issues: Max Linn, a financial planner from Bar Harbor, whose signature issue is opposition to Central Maine Power’s hydropower transmission line from Canada; and Lisa Savage, an activist, former teacher and Green Party member who is running as an independent and embraces the Green New Deal.\Collins has a relatively strong climate record, if viewed in isolation. But senators don’t operate in isolation, and with Trump in the White House and McConnell the majority leader in the Senate, Collins has not been in a position to make much difference on climate, even if she accepts the science.\Gideon’s work turning climate legislation into law in Maine means she knows the issues as well as the political pitfalls. That’s just icing on the cake for many environmentalists, who are inclined to support any Democratic challenger to Collins to help tip the Senate into Democratic control and wrest it from McConnell’s hands.\______________________________________\CORRECTION: This story was updated at 12:25 p.m. on Sept. 24, 2020, to remove the reference to Emily’s List.\0 Comments\------------\Invalid username/password.\Success.

130,"Congressman says cost would be 'detrimental to American families, businesses'\Maine lawmakers split this week on a U.S. House vote to condemn the idea of a carbon tax to fight climate change, though no serious effort has been made to impose it -- and there's no chance the Republican-controlled Congress or President Donald Trump would approve it.\U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, a two-term GOP lawmaker from Maine's 2nd District, joined colleagues Thursday to approve a resolution that insisted a carbon tax ""would be detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States.""\A near-party-line vote backed the proposal by a 229-180 vote, with six GOP members opposing it and seven Democrats favoring it. Poliquin was the only representative from New England to back the resolution, which Democratic 1st District U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree opposed.\Poliquin issued a news release that called a carbon tax ""an extreme policy that would be devastating to Maine and America's economy"" while simultaneously calling himself ""a strong supporter of efforts to protect Maine's environment.""\What appears to have spurred the House to take action was news that a Republican legislator from Florida, Carlos Curbelo, plans next week to introduce a bill that would raise $700 billion for infrastructure related to climate change by imposing new taxes on coal and natural-gas emissions. It would also repeal the federal gasoline tax and offer rebates to low-income Americans.\Curbelo told The Miami Herald, ""This is not about punishing consumers or punishing producers, it's about making sure that we can hand off a clean, healthy planet to future generations while being sensitive to economic realities.""\Speaking in defense of the anti-tax resolution, which he introduced to counter a carbon tax, Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Texas, said the measure would ""send a clear signal to the American people that we oppose policies that would drive up energy prices for families and for businesses.""\He said that ""a stand-alone carbon tax generally would have such detrimental effects on the economy and would be an unwarranted and transparent grab for revenue"" that would impose its biggest burden ""on the most vulnerable: the young, the poor, the elderly, and those living on fixed incomes.""\Poliquin said much the same.\""Our senior citizens, our veterans, and Maine families cannot afford an increase in home heating costs tied to a carbon tax,"" Poliquin said in his prepared statement.\But Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., dismissed the entire exercise as ""really meaningless.""\On the House floor, Neal told colleagues, ""If you want to debate a carbon tax, let's hold some hearings. Let's hold some discussions about a carbon tax. Let's find out what it would mean for the economy.""\He said members ""might use that moment to test what offshore drilling does for oil as part of the carbon-tax discussion or for the families in western Massachusetts,"" he said. ""Let's find out what impact it would have on fossil fuel emissions and economic growth. Let's think strategically about how it might affect our geopolitics.\""If you want to have this debate, then let's have a real debate through hearings"" in the normal course of legislative business, Neal said.\""The likelihood of a carbon tax in our future will not be changed by this silly resolution,"" Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, said on the House floor.\""But as Republicans continue to reject all ways, any ways, of addressing the climate change national security challenge, the future of our planet and our families remains endangered every bit as much as they endanger us by yielding to Vladimir Putin,"" Doggett said.\U.S. Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., said, though, that from a national security perspective, it's important that the country maintain an ability to supply fuel to allies across the globe.\""We want to be the world leader in oil and gas exports, and a carbon tax will prohibit us from being able to do that,"" Shimkus told colleagues.\He also pointed out that a variety of groups, from the Farm Bureau to FreedomWorks, call a carbon tax ""the wrong way to go because it increases costs on everybody, from the goods that we sell 'til we transport them to the market, across the board.""\U.S. Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., said a carbon tax ""might reduce the amount of energy produced from coal and natural gas,"" but it would also ""raise the cost of everything else Americans consume: gasoline, diesel fuel, food, clothing and supplies. All would become more expensive.""\Poliquin's opposition to a carbon tax is nothing new.\In a 2016 campaign debate, he denounced the idea as one that would ""drive up the price of energy,"" especially electricity, and ""kill manufacturing jobs.""\Tiffany Bond, an independent challenger to Poliquin, took to Twitter to question Poliquin's vote on this week's resolution.\The Portland attorney called the two-term incumbent's stance ""a bit of a cop-out"" because the nation ""needs to have comprehensive options"" to deal with climate change that may include a carbon tax, ""which isn't particularly extreme or novel.""\Bond said that doing something such as banning cars would be extreme, while a carbon tax is simply a policy consideration to examine.\""Economists have said repeatedly that a carbon tax is the most market-friendly way to fight climate change,"" said Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va.\The concept of a carbon tax is to makes users of fossil fuels pay for the climate damage their fuel use causes when it releases heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Scientists have raised alarms that unless humanity curbs its use of fossil fuels, the planet will become significantly hotter, ocean levels will rise, storms will become more frequent and many environmental problems will worsen.\How much of an effect a carbon tax would have on energy bills is impossible to say because there's no particular plan under consideration. But Republicans are taking aim at the idea because it has the potential to increase costs.\Shawn Moody, the Maine GOP's gubernatorial candidate, recently said he thinks a carbon tax ""would dramatically increase home heating bills for Mainers, if enacted here.""\Moody and Poliquin may be right, depending on how exactly a carbon tax is structured.\As the Congressional Budget Office noted in 2013, a tax would help the environment, but its effect on the economy ""would depend on how the revenues from the tax were used.""\A University of Maine philosophy professor, Michael Howard, has been among those arguing that a dividend plan that returned revenue to Americans would counter any increased cost to families.\Whether a carbon tax is a good idea or a bad one, the House vote made it clear that lawmakers don't plan to look into it.\Marchant said a carbon tax would hurt the economy just as it is beginning to recover from the last recession, when people are starting to see ""a brighter economic future.""\""We should not debate putting new obstacles in front of them at this time."" Marchant said.\Credit: By Steve Collins Sun Journal"

John Shimkus, R-Ill., said, though, that from a national security perspective, it’s important that the country maintain an ability to supply fuel to allies across the globe.\“We want to be the world leader in oil and gas exports, and a carbon tax will prohibit us from being able to do that,” Shimkus told colleagues.\He also pointed out that a variety of groups, from the Farm Bureau to FreedomWorks, call a carbon tax “the wrong way to go because it increases costs on everybody, from the goods that we sell ’til we transport them to the market, across the board.”\U.S. Rep.

132,"Bottle bill threat\As a legislator who has submitted measures to address plastic pollution and a fervent believer in recycling, I found the title of LD 1204, ""An Act to Increase Recycling and Composting by Creating the Maine Recycling Fund,"" intriguing. Here potentially was a combined approach to increasing recycling while simultaneously improving composting in Maine.\Unfortunately, the bill actually would harm our state's highly successful bottle bill. LD 1204 would remove larger containers from our deposit law, reducing the rate at which they are recycled. Maine has the strongest bottle return program in the country. We recycle about 90 percent of our bottles and cans, which is more than double the state's recycling rate for other items. Why weaken such a successful program?\The real intent of this bill is transferring millions of dollars to the beverage industry, and the recycling funding in the bill is not nearly enough to boost recycling and composting. In fact, municipalities would lose nearly $14 million while redemption centers, the state and charities each would lose about $1 million. Worse still, the powerful Recycling Advisory Council established in the bill would be strongly biased toward the beverage industry.\We must improve our overall recycling and composting rates, but there are other ways to get there without a giant special interest giveaway, such as employing more reusable bags, better education and public awareness and harnessing new advances in technology.\Rep.

Because none of the three bills has a Republican sponsor yet, Citizens' Climate Lobby members are lobbying Maine Sen. Susan Collins for her support.\Citizens' Climate Lobby's proposal is especially appealing because instead of returning fees to the government, it would return the fees evenly to citizens -- money in our pockets to pay for the increased cost at the pump or for a more efficient car, a market driven approach to encourage a conversion to clean energy.\Collins undoubtedly would be impressed by a letter signed by Chisholm's students urging her to support carbon pricing. It also would help the cause if these students write letters to newspapers to publicize carbon pricing efforts. A huge number of scientists and economists support those efforts, and more than 40 other countries already price carbon.

Bruce Poliquin, a two-term GOP lawmaker from Maine's 2nd District, joined colleagues Thursday to approve a resolution that insisted a carbon tax ""would be detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States.""\A near-party-line vote backed the proposal by a 229-180 vote, with six GOP members opposing it and seven Democrats favoring it. Poliquin was the only representative from New England to back the resolution, which Democratic 1st District U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree opposed.\Poliquin issued a news release that called a carbon tax ""an extreme policy that would be devastating to Maine and America's economy"" while simultaneously calling himself ""a strong supporter of efforts to protect Maine's environment.""\What appears to have spurred the House to take action was news that a Republican legislator from Florida, Carlos Curbelo, plans next week to introduce a bill that would raise $700 billion for infrastructure related to climate change by imposing new taxes on coal and natural-gas emissions. It would also repeal the federal gasoline tax and offer rebates to low-income Americans.\Curbelo told The Miami Herald, ""This is not about punishing consumers or punishing producers, it's about making sure that we can hand off a clean, healthy planet to future generations while being sensitive to economic realities.""\Speaking in defense of the anti-tax resolution, which he introduced to counter a carbon tax, Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Texas, said the measure would ""send a clear signal to the American people that we oppose policies that would drive up energy prices for families and for businesses.""\He said that ""a stand-alone carbon tax generally would have such detrimental effects on the economy and would be an unwarranted and transparent grab for revenue"" that would impose its biggest burden ""on the most vulnerable: the young, the poor, the elderly, and those living on fixed incomes.""\Poliquin said much the same.\""Our senior citizens, our veterans, and Maine families cannot afford an increase in home heating costs tied to a carbon tax,"" Poliquin said in his prepared statement.\But Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., dismissed the entire exercise as ""really meaningless.""\On the House floor, Neal told colleagues, ""If you want to debate a carbon tax, let's hold some hearings. Let's hold some discussions about a carbon tax. Let's find out what it would mean for the economy.""\He said members ""might use that moment to test what offshore drilling does for oil as part of the carbon-tax discussion or for the families in western Massachusetts,"" he said.

Will it be meters, kiosks or the ticket writers who walk the streets every day?\I have had my share of tickets and I'm sure they are a good source of revenue for the city, but my concern today is safety for those of us who work downtown. In the building I work in, we have had drug users shooting up in our restrooms, being sick in the trash barrel in the restroom and coming in the building and making a mess for the custodians to clean up at night after everyone has left. And I know this is happening in other buildings.\Yesterday, as I was walking to my car, I felt someone walking right behind me and turned around quickly, causing him to walk away. My suspicion is he saw me put my cellphone in my pocket and was going to try to grab it or my pocketbook, which was hanging on my shoulder.\What I'm getting at is I think it is about time to have a beat cop on duty, walking the streets and keeping us safe, getting to know people downtown and keeping a watchful eye on possible problems. The city is small enough to walk through it in a relatively short time, and a beat cop might just add a little more feeling of community for the area.\JoAnne Houlsen\LaGrange"

138,"In his letter (Sept. 8), Garrett Mason stated, “a carbon tax would raise gas and electricity costs for all consumers and have little environmental impact.” Though raising fossil fuel costs for consumers, the proposal by the Citizen’s Climate Lobby includes a dividend which would give more money back to the majority of Maine households than their increased expenses.\The purpose of a carbon tax is not to “raise prices on all kinds of energy, ” only on fossil fuels. A tax will lower greenhouse gas emissions in a measured and predictable way. Alternative energy will become relatively cheaper.\How ironic that people send their money out of state to fossil fuel companies — the same industry that is jeopardizing future generations. Extensive, peer-reviewed studies show that a carbon tax can have a powerful positive impact on the climate and the environment. Where does Mason get his facts?\The cost of inaction is huge. Farmers are dealing with costly adaptations to heatwaves, drought, downpours and increased pests and diseases. Fishermen are witnessing rapidly warming waters and ocean acidification, leading to the loss of Maine clams, cod and shrimp, and causing the disappearance of juvenile lobsters. Loggers see the trees they harvest infested by pests that are increasing their range.

If there is no such accountability, polluters hide the true costs of their products or actions by dumping -- yes, literally dumping -- waste into the environment, via smokestacks and vehicle exhausts, polluting the air we breathe.\More recently, Yale Professor William Nordhaus won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his detailed analyses showing that a carbon tax is by far the most effective way to lower carbon emissions. It is more efficient than using government controls such as regulating emission standards for vehicles and power plants. For comparison, raising the price of tobacco reduced smoking. \So how far does this get us in cutting carbon emissions and slowing climate change?

The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report spelled out the urgency of keeping global temperature increase to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius. It called for reducing emissions 50 percent by 2030. The new bill before Congress comes very close. So, Congress, get it done!\Credit: "

143,"
LEWISTON -- A former Maine state economist said late Wednesday that cheap, dirty coal and the federal government's unwillingness to enact a carbon pollution tax are the primary reasons Mainers pay more for power than most other Americans.
\
Charles Colgan, associate director of the University of Maine's Center for Business and Economic Research, was responding to a new video by Maine Gov. Paul LePage calling for reform that would open Maine up to more electricity imports from Canada.
\
""The biggest subsidy of all is the government's refusal to price coal (and oil) to include their social costs on the environment and health,"" Colgan said via email.
\
Maine has a disadvantage on electricity prices not because it uses renewable energy like hydro and wind power, but mainly because 42 percent of the U.S. gets its power from coal, which is among the cheapest sources of fuel, Colgan said.
\
He said Maine power would look very inexpensive if the true costs of coal energy were compensated.
\
""Maine's cost disadvantage on electricity could be wiped out or even become an advantage if the federal government were to impose a realistic carbon tax,"" Colgan said. ""This is, of course very unpopular, but Maine's opposition to a carbon tax means that we are allowing other regions like the South to be more competitive than us on electricity costs while we are still getting the costs in the form of air pollution, climate change, etc. Not a really good deal.""
\
LePage said renewables, mainly wind power, are too heavily subsidized by ratepayers and the federal government.
\
Colgan said several of the governor's statements in the video were off track.
\
""There were several comments he made that were odd (natural gas is not a renewable) or gratuitous (the implied rebuke to Angus King misses the point that wind power development was well under way in Maine before Angus got into the business; he was something of a late-comer),"" Colgan said.
\
LePage also suggested opening up the state's electrical market to free market forces, but Colgan rejected the notion.
\
"" . . . there are federal subsidies, direct and indirect, to all major energy sources and to many energy efficiency technologies,"" Colgan said. ""Seeking a 'free market' in energy is one of the more futile things one could do.""
\
Colgan said LePage's basic point, that Maine should consider importing more power from Quebec and New Brunswick, does deserve careful evaluation.
\
""Maine has several times in the past considered signing contracts with (Hydro-Quebec) and decided not to do it for various reasons,"" Colgan said.
\
In the 1980s, Maine opted to build biomass plants instead of joining with Quebec to beat the escalating price of oil-fired electricity at the time. He said the state of Vermont did decide to go with Quebec and now gets a large amount of its power from the province. He said that state's dependence on Canadian power could increase if Vermont Yankee, the state's nuclear plant, goes offline.
\
The wholesale electricity market in New England is complicated and while Maine might benefit from importing more power from Quebec, it would depend on several other important factors, Colgan said.
\
He said several questions need to be answered:
\
* What price will the Canadians charge?
\
* What will be the basis of changes in the price?
\
* What are the transmission-line-construction costs and where will they have to be built?
\
* Will southern New England want Canadian power in sufficient quantity to justify the transmission line costs?
\
""We can't just say we'll piggyback off Hydro-Quebec going to southern New England if they don't want the power,"" Colgan said. ""I'm also uncertain how much Hydro-Quebec wants to sell to New England.""
\
Colgan noted that Hydro-Quebec, a socialized company, has been growing its supply of wind energy, particularly in the Gaspe Peninsula of northern Quebec.
\
Maine should carefully assess what role natural gas will play because new sources and lower prices are making it the most affordable form of energy, Colgan said.
\
""None of these questions imply that (Hydro-Quebec) is not a possible source: They only suggest that the governor's proposal deserves careful evaluation to see what roles it could play in Maine's energy mix,"" Colgan said.

Conservative Republican Bob Inglis is a man on a mission. The former congressman from South Carolina seeks to use the conservative principles of free enterprise, limited government, liberty, accountability and reasonable risk avoidance to solve our nation's energy and climate challenges.
\
Inglis' preferred solution to implement those core principles is a revenue-neutral carbon tax. Such a tax, he believes, would level the playing field by forcing all energy suppliers to face their full costs and allow all energy subsidies rendered unnecessary by this policy to be eliminated. Energy choices then could be left to the market, instead of the government picking the winners. Furthermore, since the tax would be revenue neutral, it would not finance any new programs; government would not grow.
\
Revenue neutrality would be achieved via a tax swap -- the increased revenue from a carbon tax is offset dollar for dollar by a decrease in the tax rate on another current tax.
\
Other proposals suggest rebating the revenue directly back to households.
\
The empirical evidence suggests that assuring the tax is revenue neutral actually stimulates the economy and employment growth, reversing the traditional argument that a carbon tax is a job killer.
\
Inglis is not alone among prominent Republicans. George Shultz, who was the secretary of the Treasury under President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State under President Ronald Reagan, also supports a carbon tax. Both men have become members of the advisory committee for the Citizen's Climate Lobby, a nonpartisan group formed to educate about and to lobby for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. (A Mid-Maine Chapter of CCL has organized in Waterville.)
\
Art Laffer, the principal economic adviser for the Reagan administration, notes that the case for a carbon tax is persuasive even for those who are uncertain about the state of climate science. ""One need not take a side in the debate regarding man-made global warming in order to support improvements in U.S. energy policy,"" he said. ""Instead, by eliminating subsidies for all fuel types and making all fuel types accountable for their costs, free enterprise will make clear the best fuels for our future. Reduce taxes on something we want more of -- income -- and tax something we arguably want less of -- carbon pollution. It's a win-win.""
\
In referring to the desirability of a carbon tax vis à vis other approaches involving regulations or subsides, Harvard Professor Gregory Mankiw, the chief economic adviser during the George W. Bush administration, noted, ""Among economists, the issue is largely a no-brainer. ... The hard part is persuading the public and the politicians.""
\
It turns out that some publics and some politicians already have been persuaded. Carbon taxes already exist in a number of countries, as well as the Canadian province of British Columbia. A recent official review of the British Columbia tax, implemented in 2008, found, ""Government believes that a revenue-neutral carbon tax, where tax reductions are applied broadly across individuals and industries, is the best way to protect overall economic growth, while still creating a meaningful incentive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""
\
Given this overlap between the Republican desires for a more cost-effective energy policy and the Democratic quest to reduce the threat from climate change, this apparent area of common ground (in a political environment that has previously found very little of it) should be encouraging to those who seek bipartisan solutions.
\
It is important, however, not to get too carried away with the possibilities. Not all of this ground is common. Significant issues would have to be negotiated before any legislation could pass. First, how high should the carbon tax rate be? And how should it evolve over time? Second, revenue neutrality can be achieved either by a tax swap or by rebating the revenue to households. Which approach should prevail? Third, if the preferred path involves a tax swap, what specific tax will be targeted for lower rates (income tax? capital gains tax? Medicare tax? corporate tax?)
\
Stay tuned, and join the conversation.

146,"A bipartisan bill for a carbon tax and dividend has been introduced in the House. The Senate needs to step up.\I and many others in Maine respect the fact that U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King voted against nominees for Environmental Protection Agency administrators whose actions do nothing to protect the environment, and who deny the existential threat of climate change. \However, we need them to take heed of the good news — that 3,500 economists of all stripes and from all over the world signed a letter supporting a carbon tax and dividend system to fight climate change.\“Global climate change is a serious problem calling for immediate national action,” the letter read. “Guided by sound economic principles, we are united in the following policy recommendations.\“I. A carbon tax offers the most cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed that is necessary. By correcting a well-known market failure, a carbon tax will send a powerful price signal that harnesses the invisible hand of the marketplace to steer economic actors towards a low-carbon future.\“II. A carbon tax should increase every year until emissions reductions goals are met and be revenue neutral to avoid debates over the size of government. A consistently rising carbon price will encourage technological innovation and large-scale infrastructure development. It will also accelerate the diffusion of carbon-efficient goods and services.\“III. A sufficiently robust and gradually rising carbon tax will replace the need for various carbon regulations that are less efficient. Substituting a price signal for cumbersome regulations will promote economic growth and provide the regulatory certainty companies need for long-term investment in clean-energy alternatives.\“IV. To prevent carbon leakage and to protect U.S. competitiveness, a border carbon adjustment system should be established. This system would enhance the competitiveness of American firms that are more energy-efficient than their global competitors. It would also create an incentive for other nations to adopt similar carbon pricing.\“V. To maximize the fairness and political viability of a rising carbon tax, all the revenue should be returned directly to U.S. citizens through equal lump-sum rebates. The majority of American families, including the most vulnerable, will benefit financially by receiving more in ‘carbon dividends’ than they pay in increased energy prices.”\Such an economic plan to combat climate change has recently been introduced in the House of Representatives on a bipartisan basis as the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. \When enacted, it will have many benefits. It is, for instance, revenue neutral, and will not increase the size of government. It will be effective in reducing emissions, estimated as 80 percent by 2030. It will be good for people, not only in balancing the budgets of most lower-income families, but good for their health also. It will be good for the economy, encouraging U.S. innovation in clean energy technology that the whole world wants, while also adding an estimated total of 2.1 million new jobs. No other comprehensive proposal has emerged. \Findings from the 2017 Government Accountability Office report on the increasing costs of recovery from catastrophic weather events, called for by Sen. Collins, spelled out that the increasing cost now annually approaches half of the military budget. According to the several branches of our military, climate change is a threat multiplier. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report and the fourth National Climate Assessment both paint a picture of climate change approaching emergency status requiring concerted action. \ “The market” as it now operates is not a free market, as it does not include a price on the disposal of waste — in this case, the release of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide from emissions and methane from leaks in the natural gas system. Instead, it has been characterized by Sir Nicholas Stern as “the greatest market failure in history, because the price we pay for products and services that involve emissions of greenhouse gases does not reflect the costs they cause through damage to the climate.”\In short, we need the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act to be introduced in the Senate, too, on a bipartisan basis, then debated and enacted. We trust that Collins and King will take a lead on this effort, especially as they have already done so in the past.\ "
147,"AUGUSTA -- Gov. Janet Mills outlined an extensive climate agenda on Thursday, pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, work toward 100 percent renewable electricity generation and to work with other governors on regional solutions.\Mills said she joined a coalition of more than 20 governors committed to pursuing the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate despite the Trump administration's withdrawal from the international pact. To that end, Mills will propose the creation of a Maine Climate Council - comprised of scientists, state leaders and industry representatives - to develop an ""action plan"" while helping Maine communities adapt to a changing climate.\The Democrat had campaigned hard on climate issues, often accusing her predecessor, Republican Gov. Paul LePage, of undermining Maine's renewable energy industry and denying the threat posed by rising sea levels and warming temperatures. On Thursday, Mills told several hundred people attending an Environmental and Energy Technology Council of Maine event that the state ""cannot wait a day longer.""\""We in Maine don't need another report to tell us what we already know: that our climate is changing, that it is changing rapidly, that it will have profound implications for all of us and for future generations, and that there is very limited time to address it,"" Mills told the E2Tech Council. ""We know this because here in Maine we are witnessing changes firsthand.""\Mills' message was well received by the environment, energy and business leaders in attendance. Hours later, however, a public hearing on a controversial proposal to enact a ""carbon tax"" highlighted the political and economic challenges of aggressively tackling climate issues in a large, rural state that relies heavily on heating oil and private vehicles, rather than public transit, for transportation.\""This is a middle- and low-income family crushing tax,"" said Nick Isgro, the mayor of Waterville and vice chairman of the Maine Republican Party.\Mills said she had not yet read the bill but appeared lukewarm to the concept on Thursday.\""I'll listen to the testimony and look at the bill,"" Mills said when asked about the carbon tax. ""No other state has done it.""\MAINE CLIMATE COUNCIL WILL LEAD\Since taking office in January, the Mills administration has announced plans to install solar panels on the grounds of the governor's mansion and ended a LePage moratorium on wind power permits that was never enforced. The governor also used her speech to the E2Tech Council to reiterate her pledges to expand utilization of heat pumps and to ""vigorously support the University of Maine to lead the country in offshore floating platform wind technology development.""\Mills also announced Maine's participation in the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 22 governors committed to the goals outlined by the 2015 Paris Agreement signed by 195 countries. President Trump has since withdrawn from the pact, but members of the U.S. Climate Alliance aim to live up to the goal of reducing the nation's greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent by the year 2025 and by 80 percent in 2050.\""While the federal government ignores its responsibility to combat climate change, Maine will work with states across the country to meet the goals outlined in the Paris climate accord,"" Mills said.\The Mills administration has not released any specifics on how to accomplish that goal or how to move Maine toward generating 80 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 or the longer-term goal of 100 percent by 2050. Mills said the Maine Climate Council, which she will propose in a bill to the Legislature, would discuss those goals and recommend actions to the Legislature.\""We need to consult with the industries affected, we need to consult with the scientists and we need to have the input of all sectors of the economy and the wider Maine community,"" Mills said. ""I don't have the expertise personally to sit down and draft a bill that will reduce our fossil fuel dependency, but I know there are an awful lot of ideas out there that have been brewing for many years.""\Environmental conservation groups - including the Natural Resources Council of Maine, Environment Maine and American Farmland Trust - praised Mills' formation of the Maine Climate Council and decision to join the multistate coalition.\""By joining the U.S. Climate Alliance, and setting ambitious - but achievable - goals for reducing carbon pollution and increasing renewable energy, Mills is showing the state-level leadership that our country needs,"" Maureen Drouin, executive director of Maine Conservation Voters, said in a statement. ""With Washington unable or unwilling to act, it's up to leaders such as Gov. Mills to take bold steps to fight climate change and protect our environment for future generations.""\LAWMAKERS EXPLORE CARBON TAX\Climate-related issues are expected to attract more attention this year in both Augusta and Washington, D.C., following last November's Democratic wins.\On Thursday afternoon, a legislative committee heard several hours of testimony on a bill that would impose a carbon tax - or ""assessment"" - on heating oil, gasoline, kerosene and other fossil fuels. The assessment would begin at $5 ""per metric ton of carbon content"" - and increase annually by $5 to $40 per metric ton - on fuel distributors, refiners or manufacturers with proceeds used to reduce utility customers' bills.\Bill sponsor Rep. Deane Rykerson, D-Kittery, proposed replacing the bill Thursday with a ""Carbon Pricing Study Group"" to examine the issue and recommend changes. But Rykerson said fees on fossil fuels have proven successful in other countries - including Sweden and the Canadian province of British Columbia - in reducing fossil fuel combustion and encouraging investment in renewable energy or more efficient systems.\""The problem that we are looking at is how to return that fee to Mainers in an equitable fashion, which is why I am proposing a legislative study with stakeholders to look at how that fee can be returned to everybody in Maine who is impacted by the carbon fee. We can come back next year with a bill to both stimulate our economy and advantage of lower carbon emissions.""\But the Maine Republican Party and the Maine People Before Politics - an organization created by LePage - organized opponents who turned out by the dozens to oppose a bill that they said would merely harm lower-income Mainers and the state's economy.\Kevin Miller can be contacted at 791-6312 or at:\kmiller@mainetoday.com\Twitter: KevinMillerPPH "

Everyone should get up to speed on what is happening to the environment. There is a lot to read that is political, emotional, wrong or scary, but some that is right and it's difficult to know who to listen to.
\
Fundamentally, though, everyone needs to understand we face a pretty basic problem -- that of needing to live on Earth sustainably. As elusive as attaining that is, a friend of mine sees something very basic -- ""Although we are dealing with a whole environmental issue, much of it has to do with fossil fuels.""
\
So let's focus on fossil fuels.
\
With an all-hands-on-deck urgency, let's minimize our use of such fuels, on a personal and policy level.
\
I applaud the Sun Journal's editorial (May 2) that responded to the Supreme Court ruling enforcing the Clean Air Act. That was a great victory toward respecting the environment.
\
However, we must push further and harder to reduce pollution -- not just for its effect on personal health, but for its effect on the whole ecosystem as it warms our world.
\
The Citizens' Climate Lobby, a national organization with a chapter in Brunswick, favors establishing a revenue-neutral carbon tax. That would effectively get people to pay for the environmental impact of their lifestyle in a way that, being revenue-neutral, ensures no growth in government.
\
If people do not take carbon-reducing measures maturely now, the consequential cost will increasingly be measured by more than money can quantify.

149,"Waterville’s City Council will soon be among the Maine communities considering a resolution pertaining to climate change.\I first learned about our warming climate in the late 1980s at a public lecture presented by oceanographer Dr. Peter Larsen at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, then located in West Boothbay Harbor. I recall the beautiful summer night near the water, the data that poured over the assembled group, and our stunned silence.\Since then, I have read the reports produced by scientists affiliated with the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine in Orono. Maine is a national leader in understanding the impacts of climate change, primarily through CCI. The university’s most recent report can be found at climatechange.umaine.edu. Over the past 30 years, the damage to Maine, its environment, its economy, and its people has become evident and is only going to get worse.\After citing mountains of data, this report succinctly concludes with the following:\“There is no question that climate change in Maine:\• is accelerating, \• impacts all aspects of Maine life, \• has growing costs to society, \• does not leave us helpless, but\• business as usual is not an option” (my emphasis).\Polling conducted by Yale University in September 2020 showed that 72% of Kennebec County residents, like Americans in the rest of the country, believe that climate change is real. In a country that is tremendously divided politically, this cuts across party lines. Another strong majority of Americans (68%) believe fossil fuel companies should be required to pay a carbon tax. It’s one of the few areas in American politics (in addition to the current stimulus) where there is substantial overlap between Democrats and Republicans.\The Climate Leadership Council, a bipartisan group, strongly advocates such a tax, coupled with dividends paid directly to the American people. A carbon tax makes sense environmentally because it will incentivize the rapid reduction of carbon and reliance on carbon. Economically, it makes sense if all Americans are paid a dividend from a carbon tax. Most Americans — including the bottom 70% (i.e. most of us) — would benefit financially. Each household can determine how best to use carbon dividends — to pay for their fuel bills, buy a more fuel-efficient vehicle, or install heat exchangers or other renewable energy technologies (or not).\Big business favors this because a straightforward carbon tax is more manageable than dealing with ever-shifting government regulations. This includes companies such as ExxonMobil, General Motors and Johnson & Johnson.\After years of publicly denying climate change, notoriously, ExxonMobil is (finally) shifting gears. But the fossil fuel industry reminds me of the huge container ship that was stuck in the Suez Canal. Nothing changed until there was an effective intervention. In the meantime, the costs piled up.\Local communities around the world are the ones on the frontlines of climate change. Here in Maine, to name just a few of the impacts, downpours are more frequent, the invasive emerald ash borer is decimating ash trees, tornadoes are no longer extremely rare events, the tick is spreading disease, growing seasons are changing, periods of drought are a reality, and the famed Maine lobster fishery is heading north to cooler waters. This issue is too important to ignore at the local level.\A carbon tax with cash dividends to the American people won’t happen without local, state and federal action. We citizens can’t keep waiting for policy changes to happen, because business as usual has been the mantra of business for way, way, way too long and now climate change is obvious, dangerous, accelerating, and must be addressed effectively.\We the people have left our fates and that of our grandchildren in the hands of private industry and unresponsive government for far too long. It’s time for all of us to do something that will make a difference, something that is effective and efficient. A carbon tax with cash dividends to the American people fits that bill. It’s not a complete solution, but it’s certainly part of one.\Business as usual is not an option. Please contact your local city councilor and ask them to support the upcoming climate resolution."
150,"How would you balance the federal budget/reduce the federal deficit?The Republicans\Richard A. Bennett: Everything must be on the table for review and possible cutting. I support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\L. Scott D'Amboise: Follow the Constitution, audit the Fed, reduce the 67,000-page tax code and eliminate the IRS and go to a fair tax.\Debra D. Plowman: Stimulus packages and bailouts have been incredibly costly and have produced mixed results. Congress must be made to pass a balanced budget.\Bruce L. Poliquin: Substantial spending cuts. Balanced-budget amendment to Constitution forcing D.C. to balance its budget, like required by 49 states.\William J. Schneider: We need a balanced budget constitutional amendment, serious changes to our entitlements and block grants for Medicaid.\Charles E. Summers: The only way to balance the federal budget and reduce our debt is to cut government spending.The Democrats\Cynthia Ann Dill: Repeal the Bush tax cuts, decrease military spending and stimulate the economy with public works projects.\Matthew G. Dunlap: We must be responsible in the deployment of resources.\Jon Hinck: Start with Bowles-Simpson. Keep everything on the table including tough cuts and rescinding Bush tax cuts. Compromise to close the deal.\Justin Benjamin Pollard: 75 percent spending cuts, 25 percent tax increases. Reform Social Security and Medicare. Reduce subsidies to fossil fuel and agriculture industries.What steps do you support to reform Social Security and Medicare?\The Republicans\Richard A. Bennett: Social Security and Medicare need to become true trust funds that are protected from conflicts of interest and political gamesmanship.\L. Scott D'Amboise: I would follow the Ryan Plan.\Debra D. Plowman: Congress must come together to deal with the ever-growing deficit in the program and seriously examine benefits, eligibility and funding.\Bruce L. Poliquin: Save programs by raising age to get benefits for young workers. Less generous benefits for wealthy. No changes for current retirees or those near-current.\William J. Schneider: Promises must be kept to retired Americans and those nearing retirement, but we must adjust benefits and eligibility ages for future retirees.\Charles E. Summers: We have to stop robbing money from the Social Security Trust Fund and Medicare must remain solvent.The Democrats\Cynthia Ann Dill: Strengthen both by increasing the SS income cap and reforming the tax code and reduce costs with discipline and management of health care.\Matthew G. Dunlap: Social Security and Medicare deserve continued support.\Jon Hinck: Medicare needs cost controls from competition to lower drug and procedure prices. Lift the income cap on SS so all contribute a fair share.\Justin Benjamin Pollard: Introduce means testing. Raise eligibility ages and payroll tax cap. Reduce health care costs. Merge payroll and personal income taxes.Would you sign a pledge to never raise federal taxes? Why or why not?\The Republicans\Richard A. Bennett: I have not signed the pledge. I have said all along that the only pledge I will take is my oath to uphold the Constitution.\L. Scott D'Amboise: I already have.\Debra D. Plowman: I do not sign so-called purity pledges. I firmly believe that we have a spending problem.\Bruce L. Poliquin: Yes. Career politicians are addicted to spending taxpayer dollars. We do not have a revenue problem. The $16 trillion debt is because of overspending.\William J. Schneider: Taxes are too high, but the only pledge I will take is to support and defend the Constitution and to be a great champion for Maine.\Charles E. Summers: I have signed a pledge to never raise taxes. We have a spending problem, not a revenue problem.The Democrats\Cynthia Ann Dill: No. My pledge of allegiance is to the country, not special interest groups with agendas to get the rich even richer.\Matthew G. Dunlap: No. Such pledges reflect the current state of gridlock.\Jon Hinck: I will not sign pledges that contribute to congressional gridlock. I support tax fairness that rewards work as much as it rewards wealth.\Justin Benjamin Pollard: No, tax increases need to be options to reduce the deficit. We must simplify the tax code, eliminate deductions and create a carbon tax.How should health care be reformed?\The Republicans\Richard A. Bennett: I support making all health insurance tax-deductible and striking down regulations that get in the way of creating buying pools.\L. Scott D'Amboise: Interstate purchasing would cause competition and by competition the lower cost would be passed onto the consumer.\Debra D. Plowman: Obamacare should be repealed. Tort reform for malpractice and class-action lawsuits should be explored.\Bruce L. Poliquin: Repeal Obamacare that rations care and raises costs and taxes. Replace with market-based solution, e.g. allow the purchase of insurance across state lines.\William J. Schneider: Obamacare is built on an unconstitutional foundation and must be repealed. We need price and quality-based incentives for consumers.\Charles E. Summers: First and foremost, we must repeal Obamacare. We need to pass Association Health Plans.The Democrats\Cynthia Ann Dill: Universal single-payer health care system with an emphasis on prevention and healthy lifestyles.\Matthew G. Dunlap: The focus of health care should be on American needs, not statistics.\Jon Hinck: I support health coverage for all Americans through a system like Medicare for all. Obamacare was a major step in the right direction.\Justin Benjamin Pollard: Reduce expenditures, particularly on end-of-life care. Reduce costs through preventative care, nutrition education and exercise. Repeal ACA.Do you support a woman's right to an abortion?\The Republicans\Richard A. Bennett: Yes, but I have voted against and spoken against late-term abortions and I oppose government funding of abortions.\L. Scott D'Amboise: I believe that life begins at the moment of conception. I am pro-life.\Debra D. Plowman: I believe an abortion is the killing of an innocent child. Women deserve better than abortion.\Bruce L. Poliquin: If the life of the mother and the unborn child are both in jeopardy, the mother and her family and doctor should decide.\William J. Schneider: Yes.\Charles E. Summers: I support a woman's right to an abortion in cases of rape, incest and life of the mother.The Democrats\Cynthia Ann Dill: Yes, and other issues of concern to women: jobs with fair pay, education, family leave, child care, health care and a clean environment.\Matthew G. Dunlap: Yes.\Jon Hinck: A woman's choice is protected by our right to privacy. Government should not be involved in determining when Americans begin their families.\Justin Benjamin Pollard: I believe decisions on legality of abortion should be made by the states. I support right to life of unborn babies except in some cases.In Congress, would you support DOMA or legislation to allow civil unions or gay marriage?\The Republicans\Richard A. Bennett: No.\L. Scott D'Amboise: I do not support gay marriage or civil unions.\Debra D. Plowman: I would support DOMA.\Bruce L. Poliquin: I'm Catholic and believe in traditional marriage. States should decide these laws. Federal government should not infringe on this right of the states.\William J. Schneider: I oppose gay marriage, support civil unions and believe the federal government should stay out of state decisions.\Charles E. Summers: I support DOMA.The Democrats\Cynthia Ann Dill: I do not support DOMA and do support marriage equality.\Matthew G. Dunlap: I support full marriage equality.\Jon Hinck: I will continue to fight for marriage equality. All American families deserve the freedom to be who they are and marry whomever they love.\Justin Benjamin Pollard: I would not support DOMA. I believe decisions about gay marriage and civil unions should be made by the states. I support same-sex marriage.Should the federal government have a role in K-12 education?\The Republicans\Richard A. Bennett: Very limited. We should eliminate the Education Department as a Cabinet agency.\L. Scott D'Amboise: No.\Debra D. Plowman: Very little. Local control in education provides much better results and the money is spent on children versus bureaucrats and doubtful programs.\Bruce L. Poliquin: Education works best closest to home. It's fine for the federal government to share data and support education standards designed by states.\William J. Schneider: National standards have their place, but local leadership and flexibility are critical to achieving excellence.\Charles E. Summers: K-12 education should be handled at the state level. The federal government has proven inept.The Democrats\Cynthia Ann Dill: The federal government must ensure every child in U.S. has an equal opportunity to succeed. Adequate funding of public education is critical.\Matthew G. Dunlap: The most important education decisions involve teachers and parents.\Jon Hinck: Local decisions are key for K-12 education. Government has the obligation to see that kids everywhere have quality learning opportunities.\Justin Benjamin Pollard: Federal government should have a very limited role in K-12 education, perhaps setting minimum standard for a high school graduation exam.What are the benefits of school choice? Vouchers? Should they be available for private and religious schools?\The Republicans\Richard A. Bennett: While not a federal issue, I support vouchers and school choice.\L. Scott D'Amboise: I believe the money should follow the child. Parents have the right to send their children to whatever school they prefer.\Debra D. Plowman: School choice allows children to reach their greatest potential. Vouchers level the playing field for children who are not wealthy.\Bruce L. Poliquin: Students should have widest educational opportunities. School choice and charter schools advance that. Competition will also reduce costs.\William J. Schneider: Vouchers are one tool that should be available to enable parents to make the best choices for their children.\Charles E. Summers: I support school choice and vouchers.The Democrats\Cynthia Ann Dill: Benefits are largely unknown at this point; vouchers may starve some schools of needed resources; taxpayer money should not fund religious education.\Matthew G. Dunlap: The choices are there now; but should taxpayers fund parent choice?\Jon Hinck: School choice should be achieved without undermining public education. Taxpayer money should not be spent on private and religious schools.\Justin Benjamin Pollard: School choice and voucher programs can introduce competition, incentives and independence to schools, including private and religious ones.Do you believe climate change is happening? Do humans contribute to it? What should Congress do to address the problem?\The Republicans\Richard A. Bennett: I believe climate change is occurring and that human behavior is a factor. I do not support any additional policies to address climate change at this time.\L. Scott D'Amboise: I believe the Earth goes through cycles. I do not believe humans have had the effect that the science community is suggesting.\Debra D. Plowman: Our climate changes are cyclical in nature first but there is certainly a human and animal contribution as well.\Bruce L. Poliquin: Earth's climate changes over long cycles. Everyone wants a clean environment. Congress should not stunt economic growth with a huge carbon tax.\William J. Schneider: Climate change has been occurring since Earth's earliest days. Attempting to end climate change through regulation would be costly.\Charles E. Summers: No, however, we all have a responsibility to be good stewards of the environment.The Democrats\Cynthia Ann Dill: Yes. Yes. Government should provide incentives for efficiency and conservation, end some energy subsidies and pass laws to reduce carbon.\Matthew G. Dunlap: This is one of the greatest problems of our time.\Jon Hinck: Human activity is altering the climate. Congress must lead the transition away from dirty energy sources toward a clean, efficient future.\Justin Benjamin Pollard: Catastrophic climate disruption is definitely happening and created by humans. Congress should pass a carbon tax to reduce CO2 emissions.What should the country's energy policy look like?\The Republicans\Richard A. Bennett: I think we need to drill where it makes sense, but I do not support drilling off the coast of Maine and I support the Keystone XL pipeline and natural gas.\L. Scott D'Amboise: We need to get off all foreign oil and produce our own energy. Oil, natural gas or clean coal, we have ample supplies of energy in our own country.\Debra D. Plowman: Our energy policy should not be based on energy sources that cannot sustain themselves. Hydro power is clean, renewable and inexpensive.\Bruce L. Poliquin: Allowing full development of domestic energy resources increases supply, lowers gas prices, creates jobs and improves national security.\William J. Schneider: We must develop domestic supply, invest in our energy infrastructure and let the market pick winners and losers.\Charles E. Summers: We should be drilling and exploiting our country's own natural resources: gas, oil, coal and nuclear.The Democrats\Cynthia Ann Dill: Energy policy should reflect values: conserve, protect the environment, rely on U.S. and renewable resources and end ties with despots.\Matthew G. Dunlap: We should focus on efficiency.\Jon Hinck: Maximize efficiency and make all energy generation bear its own costs. Natural gas should be a bridging fuel to cleaner and cheaper energy.\Justin Benjamin Pollard: Energy policy should focus on conservation, support renewable energy, especially solar and redesign transport with rail and bicycle use."
151,"Voters in Washington state will be asked next month whether they want to adopt the nation's first carbon tax -- a powerful way to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. You'd think environmental groups would be doing everything they can to back that idea. You'd be wrong.\Initiative 732 will be on the ballot on Election Day. It calls for a $25-per-ton carbon tax, and it says how the proceeds should be spent: Trim the state's sales tax, cut taxes on manufacturers and give tax rebates to low-income households.\Oddly enough, this plan has failed to impress some environmental campaigners. Washington Conservation Voters, an influential local organization, opposes it because none of the revenue will go toward funding clean energy. Climate Solutions, another local group, agrees. The Sierra Club won't back the plan, saying its help for low-income households and minorities is insufficient.\Those groups haven't put their own proposal on the ballot, so they're saying it's better to do nothing than vote for Initiative 732. This position is absurd. Curbing carbon emissions is, or ought to be, the primary goal, and the plan would do that. In addition, it's an opportunity to prove the viability of the carbon-tax approach and set a valuable example for the rest of the country.\What matters most is to put a price on carbon, reflecting its true cost to the environment. Promising that the revenues from the carbon tax will be used to cut taxes and support low-income working families seems wise, in fact, because it lends the idea bipartisan appeal. But that isn't the main thing. The main thing is that the measure shouldn't fail merely because it doesn't please every group on every point.\The latest polling shows 42 percent of respondents supporting the plan, with 37 percent against and 21 percent undecided. In other words, local groups could well decide the outcome, persuading undecided voters to lean one way or the other. It would be bad enough for the measure to be voted down because climate change wasn't seen as an urgent problem. If it fails for lack of support from climate campaigners, that's worse -- and those groups should be ashamed.\Bloomberg View (Oct. 22)"
152,"AUGUSTA — Gov. Janet Mills outlined an extensive climate agenda Thursday, pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, work toward 100 percent renewable electricity generation and work with other governors on regional solutions.\Mills said she joined a coalition of more than 20 governors committed to pursuing the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement despite the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the international pact. To that end, Mills will propose the creation of a Maine Climate Council — composed of scientists, state leaders and industry representatives — to develop an “action plan” while helping Maine communities adapt to a changing climate.\The Democrat had campaigned hard on climate issues, often accusing her predecessor, Republican Gov. Paul LePage, of undermining Maine’s renewable energy industry and denying the threat posed by rising sea levels and warming temperature. On Thursday, Mills told several hundred people attending an Environmental and Energy Technology Council of Maine event that the state “cannot wait a day longer.”\“We in Maine don’t need another report to tell us what we already know: that our climate is changing, that it is changing rapidly, that it will have profound implications for all of us and for future generations, and that there is very limited time to address it,” Mills told the Environmental and Energy Technology Council of Maine. “We know this because here in Maine we are witnessing changes firsthand.”\Mills’ message was well received by the environment, energy and business leaders in attendance. Hours later, however, a public hearing on a controversial proposal to enact a “carbon tax” highlighted the political and economic challenges of aggressively tackling climate issues in a large, rural state that relies heavily on heating oil and private vehicles, rather than public transit, for transportation.\“This is a middle- and low-income family crushing tax,” said Nick Isgro, the mayor of Waterville and vice chairman of the Maine Republican Party.\Mills said she had not yet read the bill but appeared lukewarm to the concept Thursday.\“I’ll listen to the testimony and look at the bill,” Mills said when asked about the carbon tax. “No other state has done it.”\Since taking office in January, the Mills administration has announced plans to install solar panels on the grounds of the governor’s mansion and ended a LePage moratorium on wind power permits that was never enforced. The governor also used her speech to the E2Tech Council to reiterate her pledges to expand utilization of heat pumps and to “vigorously support the University of Maine to lead the country in offshore floating platform wind technology development.”\Mills also announced Maine’s participation in the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 22 governors committed to the goals outlined by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement signed by 195 countries. President Donald Trump has since withdrawn from the pact, but members of the U.S. Climate Alliance aim to live up to the goal of reducing the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent by the year 2025 and by 80 percent in 2050. \“While the federal government ignores its responsibility to combat climate change, Maine will work with states across the country to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Climate Accord,” Mills said.\The Mills administration has not released any specifics on how to accomplish that goal or how to move Maine toward generating 80 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 or the longer-term goal of 100 percent by 2050. Mills said the Maine Climate Council, which she will propose in a bill to the Legislature, would discuss those goals and recommend actions to the Legislature.\“We need to consult with the industries affected, we need to consult with the scientists and we need to have the input of all sectors of the economy and the wider Maine community,” Mills said. “I don’t have the expertise personally to sit down and draft a bill that will reduce our fossil fuel dependency, but I know there are an awful lot of ideas out there that have been brewing for many years.”\Environmental conservation groups — including the Natural Resources Council of Maine, Environment Maine and the American Farmland Trust — praised Mills’ formation of the Maine Climate Council and decision to join the multistate coalition.\“By joining the U.S. Climate Alliance, and setting ambitious — but achievable — goals for reducing carbon pollution and increasing renewable energy, Mills is showing the state-level leadership that our country needs,” Maureen Drouin, executive director of Maine Conservation Voters, said in a statement. “With Washington unable or unwilling to act, it’s up to leaders such as Gov. Mills to take bold steps to fight climate change and protect our environment for future generations.”\Climate-related issues are expected to attract more attention this year in both Augusta and Washington, D.C., following last November’s Democratic wins.\On Thursday afternoon, a legislative committee heard several hours of testimony on a bill that would impose a carbon tax — or “assessment” — on heating oil, gasoline, kerosene and other fossil fuels. The assessment would begin at $5 “per metric ton of carbon content” — and increasing annually by $5 to $40 per metric ton — on fuel distributors, refiners or manufacturers with proceeds used to reduce utility customers’ bills.\Bill sponsor Rep. Deane Rykerson, D-Kittery, proposed replacing the bill on Thursday with a “Carbon Pricing Study Group” to examine the issue and recommend changes. But Rykerson said fees on fossil fuels have proved successful in other countries — including Sweden and the Canadian province of British Columbia — in reducing fossil fuel combustion and encouraging investment in renewable energy or more efficient systems.\“The problem that we are looking at is how to return that fee to Mainers in an equitable fashion, which is why I am proposing a legislative study with stakeholders to look at how that fee can be returned to everybody in Maine who is impacted by the carbon fee. We can come back next year with a bill to both stimulate our economy and advantage of lower carbon emissions.”\But the Maine Republican Party and the Maine People Before Politics — an organization created by LePage — organized opponents who turned out by the dozens to oppose a bill that they said would merely harm lower-income Mainers and the state’s economy."

154,"I wonder if E.B. White would have come back ""once more"" to the lakes in Maine if, after his first visit, while he sat by the evening campfire, colorful sparkles from lakeside fireworks lit up the sky, blocking the stars, followed by loud, cannon-like booms shattering the peaceful atmosphere on and off again for the next few hours, night after night. \If I recall correctly, it was the natural essence of Maine's environment, the birds and the animals that stimulated his writings; the clear waters, the endless summer days, the colorful trout, the quietude of the Maine evenings complemented only by the mournful cry of the loon. \Unfortunately, the peace and quiet that E.B. wrote about have not prevailed. The problem has gone well beyond the nuisance of the two-stroke motor he so much disliked. \With the legalizing of fireworks by the state of Maine, folks are finding the lakes a convenient place to set off their evening displays along the shorelines. On some lakes, this occurs almost every night throughout the summer for a few hours starting at dusk. \Toxic substances and paper debris drift into the waters from these aerial displays, adding unwanted chemicals including phosphorous and unsightly flotsam. The loud booms scare the loons, as their panicked cries indicate. \To ask the question once again, ""Would E.B. White have bothered to come back to that lake in Maine if he encountered such noise and light pollution the first time he was there?"" \Perhaps a more topical question would be, ""Will visitors from out of the region bother to come back after they find their vacation time less than peaceful and not as advertised?"" \Is this really the way life should be? \John R. Gibbs Ipswich, Mass. \A liberal and conservative view: Address CO2 levels \We are a father and son living here in Maine. One of us is a baby boomer, a physician and a self-described liberal. The other is a millennial, a student of political science and a conservative. \Although we both love our nation and Maine, there is much that we see differently. On one critical issue, however, we feel the need to speak together. \Climate change is a real and pressing danger to our country, state and family. We all rely on the health of our planet. Although we differ on the details, it's clear to us that the future of human biological, social and financial systems ultimately depends on maintaining the health of the environment. \Effectively addressing CO2 levels is crucial to maintaining that health. \We both feel that a revenue-neutral carbon tax is a necessary step toward the important leadership that the United States must take on in maintaining our healthy planet. Both of us have confidence that a carbon tax could help us all to move toward a sustainable, predictable world - the same conditions needed for healthy ecosystems, communities, healthy markets and continued business growth. \So together, the two of us respectfully ask that Maine's delegation to the U.S. Congress help lead the way toward a worthwhile future we can all appreciate. \We ask the delegation to make use of all resources and opportunities available to their offices to promote the development and implementation of revenue-neutral carbon tax legislation. \Edward Pontius, M.D., DFAPA physician, liberal and father \Adam Pontius student of political science, conservative and son Topsham \Singing a different tune about Sen. Roger Katz \Reading Sen. Roger Katz's op-ed about the Democrats singing a Groucho Marx song (""Commentary: Democrats take cue from Groucho Marx, assistant GOP leader says,"" April 7), one word kept coming to mind: Chutzpah! For those unfamiliar with this Yiddish term, it means ""unmitigated gall or brazenness beyond imagination."" \In contrast to Sen. Katz's assertions about Democrats, Gov. LePage and his legislative enablers appear to epitomize Groucho Marx's description of politics: ""Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies."" \Sen. Katz's own voting record contradicts his claims about the supposedly good ideas coming from our chief executive. \I would remind him that the biennial budget that Gov. LePage submitted was so horrendous and so filled with bad ideas that even legislative Republicans declined to support it. \The Legislature had to do the work that Gov. LePage and finance Commissioner Sawin Millett were incapable of doing, and the new budget had to be approved with the Legislature, including Sen. Katz, overriding the governor's veto. \Discussion of reforms of our grossly mismanaged Department of Health and Human Services should begin with a discussion of the incompetence of Mary Mayhew, the lobbyist-commissioner LePage continually defends. \At the sessions of the Health and Human Services Committee that Sen. Katz mentions and that he did not attend, I found it was the Republicans on that committee who were unreasonable and unwilling to discuss realistic solutions. \In particular, when Rep. Ann Dorney noted that the electronic benefits card abuse in purchasing items not permitted by legislation involved both the EBT card-holder and a vendor - and that any sanctions should affect both parties - Reps. Deb Sanderson and Richard Malaby quickly moved to change the subject. \Louis T. Sigel Democratic candidate for Maine Senate, District 14 Gardiner \Kudos to turnpike chief for clearing trees and brush \I would like to applaud Peter Mills of the Maine Turnpike Authority on a job well done regarding the cutting of the trees and brush from Portland to Gray in both directions. \We now have a much safer highway to travel. Visibility has been greatly enhanced and there is proper drainage. We have an abundance of wildlife in our beautiful state, and by removing the trees from the side of the highway, this will allow wildlife to graze at a safer distance. \I would be interested in the cost of the project. The trees and chips had value to offset the cost, and perhaps this could be a model for more roads down the road. \I also noticed the work is being done by a local company - it is nice to see money stay within state. \We all pay higher insurance premiums in Maine because of deer-car accidents and this project will address that. \Thanks again to Peter Mills for a job well done. \Lucien Langlois Limerick"

Res. 386), urging the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to fulfill its agreement to hold credible elections, comply with constitutional limits on presidential terms, and fulfill its constitutional mandate for a democratic transition of power by taking concrete and measurable steps toward holding elections no later than December.\HOUSE VOTES\UNFUNDED FEDERAL MANDATES: The House has passed the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act (H.R. 50), sponsored by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C. The bill would require estimates of the costs to state and local governments of complying with federal program mandates to be supplied to the relevant congressional committees. A bill opponent, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, D-Va., said its requirement for government agencies to consult with impacted private companies on proposed rules before the rules are made available to the public would give the companies ""an explicit and unfair preference over other stakeholders, particularly the American families and consumers these rules are designed to protect."" The vote, on July 13, was 230 yeas to 168 nays.\NAYS: Chellie Pingree, D-1st District\YEAS: Bruce Poliquin, R-2nd District\PREVENTING GENOCIDE: The House has passed the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act (H.R. 3030), sponsored by Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., to direct the State Department to form a task force on mass atrocities and define the prevention of genocide as a core national security interest and core moral responsibility of the U.S. Wagner called the bill ""an important first step"" toward measures to prevent genocide by addressing its root causes through humanitarian, development, and strategic efforts. The vote, on July 17, was 406 yeas to 5 nays.\YEAS: Pingree, Poliquin\DIPLOMATS AND LOCATION TRACKING: The House has passed the Protecting Diplomats from Surveillance Through Consumer Devices Act (H.R. 4989), sponsored by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, to require the State Department to adopt a policy on use of cell phones and other devices that have location tracking features by workers at U.S. diplomatic and consular facilities. Castro said the policy would work to prevent dangers created by U.S. enemies who could take advantage of the tracking features to learn where diplomats are and the locations of secret foreign diplomatic installations. The vote, on July 17, was unanimous with 412 yeas.\YEAS: Pingree, Poliquin\ANIMAL DISEASE PREVENTION: The House has agreed to a motion sponsored by Rep. Collin C. Peterson, D-Minn., to instruct conferees with the Senate on the two chambers' conference negotiations over their versions of the Agriculture Improvement Act (H.R. 2). The motion instructed conferees to insist on inclusion of a provision providing permanent funding for various federal animal disease prevention and preparedness programs. Peterson called spending on the programs ""important investments in the health of our nation's animals, our people, and the security of our food supply."" The vote, on July 18, was 392 yeas to 20 nays.\YEAS: Pingree, Poliquin\IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT RESOLUTION: The House has passed a resolution (H. Res. 990), sponsored by Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., to support employees of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and denounce calls for the complete abolishment of ICE. Higgins said the resolution was needed given recent calls to abolish ICE despite the agency's successful apprehension of more than 127,000 criminal aliens on homicide and other violent charges in 2017 alone, and the resulting need to formally state congressional support for ICE workers and their mission. The vote, on July 18, was 244 yeas to 35 nays, with 133 voting as present.\PRESENT: Pingree\YEAS: Poliquin\REGULATING METHANE EMISSIONS: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., to the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 6147). The amendment would block funding for enforcement of the Environmental Protection Agency's methane emissions rule for the oil and natural gas sector adopted in 2016. Mullin called the rule a ""job-killing regulation estimated to cost our economy $530 million annually"" and unnecessary given that methane emissions related to oil and natural gas production were already declining before the EPA rule. An amendment opponent, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., said the oil and gas sector accounted for close to a third of U.S. methane emissions, helping cause destructive climate change that ""threatens the health and welfare for current and future generations.""

The amendment would block funding for implementation of the version of the social cost of carbon dioxide emissions rule developed by the Environmental Protection Agency during the Obama administration. Mullin said the rule ""could be easily manipulated in order to attempt to justify new job-killing regulations."" An opponent, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., said blocking funding ""would ignore the sobering cost of health, environment, and economic impacts of extreme weather, rising temperatures, intensifying smog, and other impacts"" of human-caused climate change. The vote, on July 18, was 215 yeas to 199 nays.\NAYS: Pingree\YEAS: Poliquin\ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTINGS: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., to the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 6147). The amendment would block funding for the enforcement of listings as threatened species or endangered species plants and animals if a given listing has not been reviewed within five years. Lamborn said nearly a thousand listings have not received the required five-year reviews and the amendment, by enforcing the review requirement, would ensure that the Fish and Wildlife Service uses the best available scientific information to review whether a species still needs to be listed. An amendment opponent, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., said the amendment's block would make the backlog worse. The vote, on July 18, was 213 yeas to 201 nays.\NAYS: Pingree\YEAS: Poliquin\RESOLUTION ON CARBON TAX: The House has passed a resolution (H. Con. Res. 119), sponsored by Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon dioxide emissions tax would harm the U.S. economy and is not in the country's best interest. Scalise said the imposition of such a carbon tax would devastate the U.S. manufacturing base, kill jobs, and ""increase costs for families all across this country."" A resolution opponent, Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Mass., said it was a pointless waste of time that should instead be spent considering ""legislation that actually would help American families today."" The vote, on July 19, was 229 yeas to 180 nays.\NAYS: Pingree\YEAS: Poliquin\FUNDING EPA AND INTERIOR DEPARTMENT: The House has passed the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 6147), sponsored by Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., to provide $35.25 billion of fiscal 2019 funding for the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and various arts and cultural agencies. Calvert cited the bill's funding for wildfire suppression, Native American schools and health care programs, and EPA efforts to improve water infrastructure and clean up contaminated land. An opponent, Rep. Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., criticized the bill's cuts in funding for several EPA programs as failing ""the American people by slashing environmental protection.""

The vote, on July 16, was unanimous with 85 yeas.\YEAS: Susan Collins, R-Maine; Angus King, I-Maine\FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MEMBER: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of Randal Quarles to serve on the Federal Reserve board of governors for a 14-year term ending in 2032. A supporter, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., cited Quarles's domestic and international financial experience in multiple presidential administrations. An opponent, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said that in his past year on the board, Quarles has been ""doing favors for Wall Street at the expense of working families,"" including by weakening standards meant to ensure that large banks do not lend recklessly. The vote, on July 17, was 66 yeas to 33 nays.\YEAS: Collins, King\APPEALS COURT JUDGE: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of Andrew S. Oldham to serve as a judge on the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. A supporter, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., cited Oldham's unanimously well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association, recommendations from peers across the political spectrum, and experience litigating in federal appeals courts, as well as Oldham's current service as general counsel to the Texas governor. The vote, on July 18, was 50 yeas to 49 nays.\YEAS: Collins\NAYS: King\RUSSIA RESOLUTION: The Senate has passed a resolution (S.

Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, to require the State Department to adopt a policy on use of cell phones and other devices that have location tracking features by workers at U.S. diplomatic and consular facilities. Castro said the policy would work to prevent dangers created by U.S. enemies who could take advantage of the tracking features to learn where diplomats are and the locations of secret foreign diplomatic installations. The vote, on July 17, was unanimous with 412 yeas.\YEAS: Pingree, Poliquin\ANIMAL DISEASE PREVENTION: The House has agreed to a motion sponsored by Rep. Collin C. Peterson, D-Minn., to instruct conferees with the Senate on the two chambers' conference negotiations over their versions of the Agriculture Improvement Act (H.R. 2). The motion instructed conferees to insist on inclusion of a provision providing permanent funding for various federal animal disease prevention and preparedness programs. Peterson called spending on the programs ""important investments in the health of our nation's animals, our people, and the security of our food supply."" The vote, on July 18, was 392 yeas to 20 nays.\YEAS: Pingree, Poliquin\IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT RESOLUTION: The House has passed a resolution (H. Res. 990), sponsored by Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., to support employees of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and denounce calls for the complete abolishment of ICE. Higgins said the resolution was needed given recent calls to abolish ICE despite the agency's successful apprehension of more than 127,000 criminal aliens on homicide and other violent charges in 2017 alone, and the resulting need to formally state congressional support for ICE workers and their mission. The vote, on July 18, was 244 yeas to 35 nays, with 133 voting as present.\PRESENT: Pingree\YEAS: Poliquin\REGULATING METHANE EMISSIONS: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., to the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 6147). The amendment would block funding for enforcement of the Environmental Protection Agency's methane emissions rule for the oil and natural gas sector adopted in 2016. Mullin called the rule a ""job-killing regulation estimated to cost our economy $530 million annually"" and unnecessary given that methane emissions related to oil and natural gas production were already declining before the EPA rule. An amendment opponent, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., said the oil and gas sector accounted for close to a third of U.S. methane emissions, helping cause destructive climate change that ""threatens the health and welfare for current and future generations."" The vote, on July 18, was 215 yeas to 194 nays.\NAYS: Pingree\YEAS: Poliquin\CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS RULE: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., to the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 6147). The amendment would block funding for implementation of the version of the social cost of carbon dioxide emissions rule developed by the Environmental Protection Agency during the Obama administration. Mullin said the rule ""could be easily manipulated in order to attempt to justify new job-killing regulations."" An opponent, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., said blocking funding ""would ignore the sobering cost of health, environment, and economic impacts of extreme weather, rising temperatures, intensifying smog, and other impacts"" of human-caused climate change. The vote, on July 18, was 215 yeas to 199 nays.\NAYS: Pingree\YEAS: Poliquin\ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTINGS: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., to the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 6147). The amendment would block funding for the enforcement of listings as threatened species or endangered species plants and animals if a given listing has not been reviewed within five years. Lamborn said nearly a thousand listings have not received the required five-year reviews and the amendment, by enforcing the review requirement, would ensure that the Fish and Wildlife Service uses the best available scientific information to review whether a species still needs to be listed. An amendment opponent, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., said the amendment's block would make the backlog worse. The vote, on July 18, was 213 yeas to 201 nays.\NAYS: Pingree\YEAS: Poliquin\RESOLUTION ON CARBON TAX: The House has passed a resolution (H. Con. Res. 119), sponsored by Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon dioxide emissions tax would harm the U.S. economy and is not in the country's best interest. Scalise said the imposition of such a carbon tax would devastate the U.S. manufacturing base, kill jobs, and ""increase costs for families all across this country."" A resolution opponent, Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Mass., said it was a pointless waste of time that should instead be spent considering ""legislation that actually would help American families today."" The vote, on July 19, was 229 yeas to 180 nays.\NAYS: Pingree\YEAS: Poliquin\FUNDING EPA AND INTERIOR DEPARTMENT: The House has passed the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 6147), sponsored by Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., to provide $35.25 billion of fiscal 2019 funding for the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and various arts and cultural agencies. Calvert cited the bill's funding for wildfire suppression, Native American schools and health care programs, and EPA efforts to improve water infrastructure and clean up contaminated land. An opponent, Rep. Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., criticized the bill's cuts in funding for several EPA programs as failing ""the American people by slashing environmental protection."" The vote, on July 19, was 217 yeas to 199 nays.\NAYS: Pingree\YEAS: Poliquin\SENATE VOTES\EDUCATION ASSISTANT SECRETARY: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of Scott Stump to serve as the Education Department's assistant secretary for career, technical, and adult education. A supporter, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., cited Stump's experience in career and technical education in the Colorado community college system and as head of a national association of state career and technical education directors, and support for his nomination from many stakeholder and advocacy groups. The vote, on July 16, was unanimous with 85 yeas.\YEAS: Susan Collins, R-Maine; Angus King, I-Maine\EDUCATION DEPARTMENT PLANNER: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of James Blew to serve as the Education Department's assistant secretary for planning, evaluation, and policy development. A supporter, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said Blew had 20 years of experience at various charter school and education reform groups, yielding a track record of being ""in favor of giving low-income children a choice of a better school and in favor of public charter schools, which gives teachers more freedom to teach and parents more freedom to choose the school for their child."" An opponent, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Blew supported undermining public education, including by not giving teachers the tools they need to help students succeed. The vote, on July 17, was 50 yeas to 49 nays.\YEAS: Collins\NAYS: King\FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MEMBER: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of Randal Quarles to serve on the Federal Reserve board of governors for a 14-year term ending in 2032. A supporter, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., cited Quarles's domestic and international financial experience in multiple presidential administrations. An opponent, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said that in his past year on the board, Quarles has been ""doing favors for Wall Street at the expense of working families,"" including by weakening standards meant to ensure that large banks do not lend recklessly. The vote, on July 17, was 66 yeas to 33 nays.\YEAS: Collins, King\APPEALS COURT JUDGE: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of Andrew S. Oldham to serve as a judge on the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. A supporter, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., cited Oldham's unanimously well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association, recommendations from peers across the political spectrum, and experience litigating in federal appeals courts, as well as Oldham's current service as general counsel to the Texas governor. The vote, on July 18, was 50 yeas to 49 nays.\YEAS: Collins\NAYS: King\RUSSIA RESOLUTION: The Senate has passed a resolution (S. Res. 584), sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., expressing the sense of the Senate opposing making current or former government employees available to the Russian government for questioning. Schumer cited the Putin-Trump summit meeting in Helsinki early this week as prompting the Senate to need to state its opposition to submitting ""our citizens, let alone our ambassadors, to the interrogation of a foreign adversary"" such as Russia. The vote, on July 19, was unanimous with 98 yeas.\YEAS: Collins, King"

Jay Inslee gets in his apparent bid for the White House, he has a tremendous opportunity to make climate change and the environment focal points in the 2020 presidential race.\Every viable candidate must have a workable, national plan to substantially reduce greenhouse-gas emissions while growing the economy, especially after major setbacks under President Donald Trump. Inslee hasn't yet announced a campaign but is acting like a candidate.\As Washington's governor, Inslee has a compelling story to tell about the state's ability to grow its economy, increase education spending and host the nation's two most valuable companies -- all while reducing emissions, increasing use of renewable energy and enforcing strong regulations to protect the health of forests, waterways and air quality. His experience living in Yakima County and representing Washington's farm country in Congress is also a plus.\At the same time, Inslee must stay focused on his current job, despite the urgency of the climate situation and the national spotlight. Inslee's attention is especially needed during the next six months as the Legislature grapples with his proposal to belatedly address the dire state of mental-health services in Washington. He also has presented an ambitious and costly spending plan on the environment and an array of other issues that demand his engagement.\Inslee made clean energy and climate change signature issues in Congress and as governor since he took that office in 2012.\While Inslee's calls for a carbon tax foundered and his aggressive clean-air regulations to directly cap emissions were stymied by legal challenges, he still made progress. Inslee secured investments in clean-energy research, pushed to increase electric vehicle use in the state and co-founded a coalition of 17 governors working to uphold the Paris Agreement on climate-change goals.\Energy related greenhouse-gas emissions in Washington declined 3 percent since their pre-recession high in 2007, despite population growth and the nation's fastest economic growth in recent years. Emissions are expected to fall 5.5 percent by the time Inslee's current term ends in 2020, according to modeling by the state Office of Financial Management.\Although Washington voters twice rejected carbon taxes, that could be to Inslee's advantage: He's particularly qualified to address the challenge of building consensus for environmental policies.\Will Inslee draw on that experience and pursue a national climate agenda that could win support beyond his deep green base, or will he run as a provocateur, forcing the other presidential candidates to prioritize the issue until the primary?\The time has come. Most people in Washington and the U.S. believe climate change is a threat and that government should do more about it, according to the latest national surveys done by Yale and George Mason universities.\Growing awareness affirms the need for a candidate like Inslee to champion the cause. It also suggests that it's time to elevate the policy discussion and move beyond hyperbolic arguments about whether climate change is real or not. The majority is convinced and doesn't need fear mongering or virtue signaling from either side.\People are ready to have a reasonable conversation about how to respond, and the cost and effectiveness of various options. That's a key take-away from the failure of November's carbon-tax proposal, Initiative 1631: It failed not because Washingtonians are conflicted, misled or denying climate change, but because they want government's response to be reasonable, effective and accountable. Such subtleties were lost in the acrid campaign, fueled by record campaign spending by oil companies and others.\Inslee also can point to innovation as a path forward. He's been a strong advocate for private- and public-sector research and advanced product development. That includes championing state support for Boeing's development of cutting-edge, fuel-efficient jetliners. The state also has a strong cluster of expertise in nuclear energy, which should be part of the solution to weaning the world from fossil fuels.\Much more must be done to reduce the enormous harm that humans are causing to the Earth. Inslee is a passionate and persistent advocate for the environment who should play an important role making this a top priority in the 2020 presidential race.\Credit: "

162," Sign the petitions to cut climate-changing pollutants, attend the rallies, get exercised about the fate of the Earth. Today is Step It Up day, with a couple dozen rallies around Maine and hundreds nationally to demand action in Congress. But while you Step It Up, you might also Try It Out to get a feel for what you're demanding.\ The Step It Up campaign is simple: By 2050, the United States will cut its carbon-based energy use by 80 percent. It's also immensely complicated: What heats your house? Where are your clothes from? You are an unintentional global trader in a market that runs on fossil fuels.\ How are you going to get to work or to school? How will you get to the grocery store to pick up the plastic-encased quart of strawberries from California? You may say, virtuously, that you will get them in your Prius, in which your neighbor will car pool on her way to the carbon-offset store, but you know, if you are anything like 99 percent of us, that your days are filled with endless comforts that have helped raise average global temperatures.\ I remember a Cold War truism: The only thing that would bring all of us together, friendly and hostile nations alike, was a threat from outer space. Now it's here, only it's inner space and, instead of alien invasion, it is humankind's sustained gassy belch from a century of pleasurable feasting at the planet's table.\ Congress should act; the president should act. They should establish standards, incentives, investments and tough rules to move this nation away from the fossil-fuel economy that has taken us this far. This week's Time magazine has a handy section on what works to reduce climate-change emissions, and, as you might guess, the action leans heavily on governmental decisions: carbon cap-and-trade, sequestration, a carbon tax, green building design standards.\ Before members of Congress risk acting on these, however, they will test - do you really want these things? Even if the economy must change, sometimes painfully? Even if there are new taxes involved? They will want to know how committed you are to a new course, and more than your petitions to them, they will want to see you act first. That is the nature of political leadership.\ Fortunately, there's plenty you can do that, while having a small environmental impact, matters for the unambiguous message it sends. Start, for example, with knowing your footprint - the amount of land you require to serve the way you currently live. There's a simple way to estimate it at myfootprint.org. Answer the 15 or so questions (there's an in-depth questionnaire under the site's FAQs). If you're not a good 25 percent below the national average, you're a serious part of the problem.\ The Union of Concerned Scientists' book ""A Consumer's Guide to Effective Environmental Choices"" says forget worrying about whether you use Styrofoam cups, your kids are in cloth or disposable diapers and your clothes are cotton or polyester. Those aren't what counts when piling up pollution.\ Instead, it hits the biggies - buy a house close to work; think twice about that second car - that set fine long-term strategies but don't do much for immediate payback.\ Try something simpler: Plan your errands for the next week and combine as many trips as you can on an efficient route. (Delivery companies, where profits depend on this, have extensive computer programs to help them; you might use your brain and a map as effectively.) The more you can cut your mileage, the more your vehicle becomes the equivalent of an enviro-car.\ Eat less red meat. Meat consumption doesn't sound like a climate- change problem, but to produce the same nutritional value from meat as from grains takes about 3.4 times the greenhouse gases; for poultry, it's about 1.4 times. Buy food locally and reduce the need for shipping. The Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (mofga.org) can help you find sources.\ Keep buying those compact fluorescent light bulbs. With the rebates being offered, even if you hate the environment they're a great deal. And no person can use a clothes dryer year-round and be an environmentalist. Get a clothesline. With global warming here, it will work faster than ever.\ You won't solve the climate-change problem with these or any of a dozen more steps, but by acting now you will demonstrate your seriousness about the issue. The point is to make an environmental commitment, even if that means accepting a little inconvenience. Then contact the politicians - and just think of all the persuasive anecdotes you'll have to make your point.\ Todd Benoit is the editorial page editor of the Bangor Daily News.

163,"The candidates seeking to represent to Maine's 1st Congressional District divided on humans' role in climate change but agreed on the need to get money out of politics during a polite and, at times, jovial debate Tuesday night.\U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat, and independent state Rep. Marty Grohman agreed that human action has played a role in the earth's shifting climate and that government regulation has a role in combating it. Pingree said that she supports a tax on carbon emissions, while Grohman said ""I would support a carbon tax but I don't believe that it will cut fairly across the economy.""\Republican Mark Holbrook, on the other hand, said that the body of scientific research supporting the idea that humans have affected the climate is actually ""far from settled and fraught with a lot of bias."" The Brunswick resident said he opposes a carbon tax.\The candidates shared a stage Tuesday evening at Bowdoin College in the third and final debate of a race that will be among the first federal elections decided by ranked-choice voting.\The debate was moderated by Maine Public. It was live streamed online and will re-air on TV at 8 p.m. Thursday.\The campaign of Grohman, a Biddeford resident, appears pinned to the hope that the new voting system could lead to an upset in Democratic-leaning district and allow him to unseat Pingree, of North Haven, who has won her five past races in the district by convincing margins.\[Ranked-choice voting poses greater threat to Pingree than either of her opponents]\But in recent weeks and during the last debate, the independent has more visibly been at odds with Holbrook than with the frontrunning incumbent.\Last week, for instance, Grohman asked several state agencies to investigate whether Holbrook broke state law by calling himself a psychologist -- an alleged misrepresentation that the Republican denies.\Grohman struck an amiable tone Tuesday and sought to diffuse campaign tensions with gifts for both of his opponents.\He gave Holbrook a Whitman's Sampler in reference to the Republican's earlier statement that he'd have as hard a time picking a favorite among President Trump's policies as he would among chocolates. Holbrook handed the box off to Pingree.\[image id=""2711419"" size=""full"" pos=""center"" /]\The candidates were in agreement on seeing the the tide of money that's surged into American politics in recent years as a problem, but none saw it as easily solved. Holbrook noted his ""paltry"" fundraising compared to his opponents.\Unlike Maine's 2nd Congressional District -- where out-of-state money has poured in to support both U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, the incumbent Republican, and challenging Democratic Assistant Maine House Minority Leader Jared Golden -- the state's southern congressional race has seen relatively little national attention or cash flow.\[Pingree's challengers take shots at each other in 1st District debate]\In this environment, Pingree has retained a commanding fundraising lead. As of the most recent campaign finance filings, she'd raised approximately $720,000, while Grohman raised $354,000 and Holbrook brought in $89,000.\The debate had few tense exchanges, but two came while the candidates were questioning each other.\Pingree asked Holbrook about whether the administration's immigration policies were hurting Maine businesses that rely on seasonal immigrant workers. In response, the Republican suggested that getting more Mainers to work should be the priority and that it is addiction that's causing the state's workforce problems.\""If they weren't strung out on opioids we'd have people who want to work,"" he said.\Another more heated moment came as Holbrook questioned Grohman on abortion, repeatedly asking him to define the start of life -- a question the independent sidestepped.\In their closing statements, Pingree told voters that she'd be a check on the president, while Groman pledged to be free from the sway of the political parties.\Holbrook stressed that he'd be accessible to voters and presented himself as an alternative to ""career politicians.""\CORRECTION: This story previously misstated Grohman's position on a carbon tax.

164,"Climate action\Last month's UN climate change report, based on input from some 1,500 scientists from around the world, contains data about the alarming effect that human-caused carbon emissions are having upon our planet. The chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that the report ""should jolt people into action.""\Here in Maine some people are taking action by working with a mid-Maine chapter (other Maine chapters may soon follow) of the national Citizens' Climate Lobby, the main goal of which is to encourage Maine, and all of the U.S. if possible, to start charging a revenue-neutral carbon tax for carbon emissions.\Charging such a fee would be a logical extension of the longstanding custom of charging individuals and businesses for garbage collection and disposal. Some foreign countries and three U.S. states are already charging fees or taxes for carbon emissions, so Maine has examples to follow and learn from.\Any effort to curb carbon emissions will help us get one step closer to a sustainable world, an enviable reality we do not currently have but desperately need.\Laurie Sproul\Canton\Did anything change?\As our nation observed the 50th anniversary of the signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act on April 10, I listened to a public radio conversation in which historians and journalists reflected on what happened that day.\I was surprised to hear that, on that fateful day, President Lyndon Johnson had lamented to his press secretary, Bill Moyers, that giving black Americans equal rights meant that Democrats ""have lost the South for a generation.""\Indeed, the then-deeply Democratic South has since shifted strongly Republican.\Based on the conversation I heard, Johnson's signature on the act sent racist southern Democrats searching for a party to cater to their bigoted views and support their commitment to the principles that formed the foundation of the Ku Klux Klan, namely, to control freed slaves after the Civil War.\What political party came to their rescue? The Republican Party.\I didn't feel particularly good reaching that conclusion, so I consulted the research database at the University of Maine's Fogler Library. There, a paper entitled, ""Personality and attitude determinants of voting behavior,"" found that people who voted for Republican presidential candidates ""showed significantly more negative racial attitudes."" And those voters, with some possible exceptions, identify themselves as Republicans.\That study was done in 1972; you could hope attitudes have changed since. But other more recent studies support it. And when you know of Republican efforts underway right now nationwide to deny minorities the right to vote, you have to wonder whether anything has changed at all.\Mark Kelley\Belfast\Cold War thinking\Lately there has been a revival of Cold War thinking in relation to climate change and global warming. At one time, proponents of destroying the Soviet Union became convinced that our side might have a minuscule advantage in missile ""throw weight,"" accuracy of warheads, megatonnage and kill ratios. The point was that in the event of a nuclear catastrophe, while our country might lose 30 or 40 million people, we would still win the war.\What we have learned from the latest Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change's report is that there are ever-greater risks associated with rising global temperatures, now predicted with high confidence by scientists around the world. While those who deny the science are forever with us, a new kind of skepticism has arisen, which finds it acceptable that we may see cataclysmic events in certain environments around the world -- coastlines, island chains, countries with a land mass at sea level -- but that the loss of these areas, and the people who inhabit them, might be tolerable. We would survive based on what is euphemistically described as a cost-benefit analysis.\The inevitable question then becomes: Who will decide these questions?\Bevan Davies\Kennebunk\Equal pay\The recent vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act in the U.S. Senate was not good for women who find themselves in the same jobs as men but don't get paid equally. Our Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King voted not to give women equal pay.\Collins is Republican first, she has a job that pays equally for her years of service. King apparently doesn't want women to get equal pay for equal work. He must still follow Republican footsteps.\Barbara Ouellette\St. Francis\Thanks for support\On behalf of Be The Match, I commend Rep. Stanley Short Jr. for his efforts to bring attention to the critical need for volunteer bone marrow donors.\Short's April 9 OpEd called for support of LD 1600, a bill enacted by the Maine House of Representatives to encourage potential marrow donors to join the national registry.\As Short explained, the need is great. Every four minutes, someone is diagnosed with a blood cancer. And 70 percent do not have a donor in their family. They depend on Be The Match to find their lifesaving match.\Be The Match is the world's leading nonprofit organization focused on saving lives through marrow and cord blood transplantation. Every day, we work to improve access to transplants by spearheading efforts to remove barriers to treatment and meet the growing need among patients.\We have made incredible progress. Our national Be The Match Registry has expanded from just 10,000 potential donors in 1987, to more than 11 million volunteers today. Be The Match is the largest and most diverse registry worldwide, and we have facilitated more than 61,000 transplants.\Our growing community of donors, volunteers, health care professionals, researchers and financial supporters has been critical to this success. The leadership shown by elected officials has been equally vital to our lifesaving mission.\We appreciate Short's passionate advocacy for increasing the number of potential volunteer marrow donors. We thank him and the people of Maine who have supported this lifesaving cause.\Chad Ramsey\Legislative director, Be The Match\Washington, D.C."

LEWISTON - A coalition of environmental groups has given Maine the highest grade among New England states for its efforts to address climate change.
\
Maine received a B, compared to a D-plus for New Hampshire, C-minus for Vermont and Massachusetts, and C-plus for Connecticut and Rhode Island. In the report card, which also included five eastern Canadian provinces, only Quebec scored higher, with a B-plus.
\
The score card, which grades states on their progress toward meeting goals established by a 2001 action plan developed by the Conference of New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers, was produced by the Natural Resources Council of Maine, Environment Maine and 16 other environmental organizations.
\
Overall, the report said, the region isn't doing enough to address climate change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions or prepare for the future.
\
The states were graded on eight categories and those grades were averaged to produce an overall score.
\
""Maine has made very good progress,"" said Jennifer Andersen, an advocate for Environment Maine. ""But the administration needs to continue its commitment and dedication to climate change and be very aggressive if we're going to reduce emissions.""
\
Overall, she said, a B is a good grade. ""On the policy goals, we think, Maine is doing very well,"" Andersen said.
\
But even with policies that have been adopted, the state isn't likely to meet the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2012, Andersen said. ""But we feel there is enough time to see real reductions on that time frame.""
\
In individual categories, Maine received an A-minus on conducting a greenhouse gas inventory and creating a plan to reduce emissions and conserve energy.
\
""Maine did well on (those categories),"" Andersen said, ""which is important because its something that has to happen before you can be successful on the other things. If you're going to take action, you need a plan. And if you don't have a good plan, how are you going to be successful? Maine has a very good plan.""
\
Maine's grades dropped on promoting public awareness, where it received a C-plus, and for reducing or adapting to the impact of climate change, where it scored a C-minus.
\
""We need to really understand what the changes are going to be,"" Andersen said. ""We have a lot of resource-based industries and they likely will feel the impact of global warming. ... We need to look at adaptation and see what we need to do in the future.""
\
""Since taking office, I have set high goals for the state to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Gov. John Baldacci in a statement released Monday. ""I am pleased our efforts to reduce these emissions have been recognized once again. It is important to meet the aggressive targets of Maine's Climate Change Action Plan to avert a climate crisis.""
\
Quebec received high marks for its emission reduction plan, which could reduce the release of greenhouse gases 1.5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. Included in the plan is a carbon tax, which could result in $200 million in revenue per year to finance the emissions plan.
\
New Hampshire, according to the report, hasn't created a plan to reduce emissions and has taken few steps to reduce emissions.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government is speeding up Canada's planned elimination of traditional coal-fired power plants, doubling down on green pledges as its top trading partner moves in the opposite direction.
\
Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said Monday the country would phase out traditional coal power by 2030, an acceleration of existing measures that the government says affects four facilities in Canada not already facing retrofit or shutdown by then. They include two facilities in Nova Scotia owned Nova Scotia Power, an Emera Inc. subsidiary, and one each in Saskatchewan and New Brunswick owned by provincial crown corporations.
\
Canada, which already draws 80 percent of its electricity from non-emitting sources, is pressing ahead with plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions amid warnings from Trudeau's political opponents that doing so will create a competitive imbalance with the neighboring U.S., where President-elect Donald Trump wants to back out of climate pledges and boost coal production. ""Phasing out coal-fired electricity and expanding clean power sources will create new jobs and opportunities,"" McKenna said Monday, speaking to reporters in Ottawa. Eliminating smog caused by coal power generation will also reduce health impacts, she said.
\
Trudeau has unveiled a series of environmental measures in recent months, including a minimum price on carbon and expanded funding for marine protection. His centrist Liberal Party is trying to balance demands of environmental advocates with spurring Canada's sluggish economic growth. Trudeau faces deadlines to decide on three pipeline projects over the next month.
\
The change essentially requires coal plants to meet a tougher emissions standard -- 420 metric tons of carbon dioxide per gigawatt hour -- more quickly than previously scheduled, unless they adopt carbon-capture technology to cut emissions. If they convert to natural gas, they need only meet a 550 metric ton standard until 2045, when the tougher standard kicks in. McKenna also said she'd work with provinces on equivalency agreements, leaving the door open to keep coal plants running if emissions cuts are found elsewhere.
\
The move will see Canada generate 90 percent of electricity from non-emitting sources by 2030, McKenna said. It will also cut emissions by 5 metric megatons, the equivalent of taking 1.3 million cars off the road, according to government estimates.
\
Coal power represents about 8 percent of Canadian greenhouse gas emissions, the government said. It accounts for about 11 percent of the country's electricity, concentrated mostly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, and also in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, according to a report issued Monday by the Pembina Institute, an environmental think-tank.
\
Alberta and Saskatchewan are major oil producers reeling from the impacts of a commodities slump. Alberta has already pledged its own coal phase-out, while Saskatchewan is balking at Trudeau's earlier announcement of a minimum carbon price.
\
Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall criticized Trudeau for again preempting a December meeting with provincial leaders, where a pan-Canadian climate strategy is due to be discussed.
\
""These actions have severely undermined the December meeting and have exposed the Prime Minister's disingenuous commitment to federal-provincial collaboration,"" Wall said in a statement. ""We will continue to strongly oppose any attempt to impose a federal carbon tax on Saskatchewan and will not support any agreement at the December meeting unless the proposed federal carbon tax is withdrawn.""
\
Ontario -- Canada's most populous province -- phased out coal over the past decade. Air quality has improved while electricity rates in the province have roughly doubled. McKenna said the government was ""working to ensure"" the coal phase-out in other provinces does not increase rates and provided no further details.
\
The federal government didn't announce new funding for provinces to shut down coal power. Earlier this month, however, it announced billions in new funding for unspecified green infrastructure, as well as the creation of an infrastructure bank.

168,"As a fan and former colleague of Rep. Tom Allen (""Bloomberg the best bet to unite Democrats,"" Feb. 26), I'm disappointed that he doesn't recognize that many of his pro-Michael Bloomberg arguments apply with greater force to Joe Biden. Bloomberg is a tremendous asset to Democrats, but Biden is the better candidate because he is the better politician.\Biden offers all the coalition-building skills of Bloomberg but has been able to do it without using a private fortune.\Biden also has far more experience working in U.S. and international politics. He'll be ready on day one. Most important, he will be eager to reverse the autocratic precedents the impeached president has set. Like any successful solo businessman, Bloomberg is likely to chafe at the give and take required by our system of checks and balances and our traditions of transparency. Didn't we see this in his debate behaviors - why his reluctance to give up non-disclosure agreements? Where are his tax returns?\All of his money and expertise should be at the disposal of the Democratic nominee if we can trust what Bloomberg has already nobly offered: to use his money to beat the impeached president, whoever the Democratic candidate may be.\If we're concerned about voting out the impeached president and skeptical of Bernie Sanders (who seems to have his own trouble with give and take and transparency), Bloomberg and Allen should be working - right now - for the candidate in the best position to beat Trump, and that's Biden. If we wait, Bernie, the less electable candidate, may be unstoppable.\Ellen Kandoian Sweeney\South Portland\Sen. Klobuchar aims for unity\In our first-ever primary March 3, Maine voters have the opportunity to vote for a progressive pragmatist who get things done: Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\As a senator working in a polarized partisan environment, Amy has worked effectively with both parties to pass more than 100 bills. Amy has progressive principles but doesn't allow ""the perfect get in the way of the good."" Her focus on pursuing unifying policies is evident in her home state of Minnesota, where she has won voter support in every district.\Amy is committed to reducing the cost of health care, prescription drugs and health insurance through much-needed reforms to the Affordable Care Act, and the development of a public option for buying in to Medicare or Medicaid.\As president, Sen. Amy Klobuchar will lead America together and forward. I urge Democratic voters to check the box for Amy on March 3.\Dianne Fallon\Kittery Point\'Mayor Pete' a match for Maine\South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the best Democratic presidential candidate and draws the biggest contrast to Donald Trump.\Pete is a public servant who served in Afghanistan, where Trump avoided Vietnam with bone spurs. Pete is young and looks at the world with hope instead of fear and grievance. Through his life, Pete has shown focus and determination, placing results over righteous anger and needless confrontation. I deeply admire Pete's humbling experience in struggling to accept his identity as a gay man.\Pete's policies address difficult issues like climate change, but they're more attainable than Bernie Sanders'. Trump has brought trust in government to an all-time low, and we need politicians who keep their promises.\A good example of how thoughtful Pete's ideas are is his carbon tax. A tax on emissions is easy for the government to enforce without an army of bureaucrats and also hard for companies to bend such a straightforward rule. A carbon tax motivates everyone to pollute less.\Cleverly, the money raised would be returned to all U.S. citizens in direct payments. This would help cover higher costs of gasoline or heating houses, while leaving the choice of what to spend the money on up to individuals. Those payments help address the criticism that climate change costs fall disproportionately on working class people who have fewer resources.\Mayor Pete is an inspiring figure who has real accomplishments and sacrifices to hold up against Donald Trump. His quiet and thoughtful work ethic are a good fit for Maine.\Ned Swain\Portland\Sanders' goal: A better world
\My vote's for Bernie Sanders in the March 3 Democratic primary.\Bernie plans to strengthen our society with programs to keep us all healthy (slash prescription drug costs; ""Medicare for All""; reduce climate change); sheltered (investment in affordable housing); educated (nutrition for scholars; free public college), and safe (reduce climate change; shutter nuclear plants; universal background checks; voluntary buyback of assault-style weapons).\Join me in voting for a better world for us, and for our children and grandchildren. Vote for Bernie Sanders.\Katie Huntington\Newcastle\"
169,"""We're a society of distracted drivers. We're not paying attention to what matters most."" - Michael Lewis, author (on NPR's ""Fresh Air,"" Oct. 3, 2018)\Lost in the discussion of America's partisan, gender and racial divides is a fault line that's rarely discussed: the gap between what U.S. citizens want for the planet and what many elected leaders are delivering.\A poll of American voters, conducted last March by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, found that 70 percent of respondents believe the U.S. should reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, 71 percent support fossil fuel companies paying a carbon tax, 85 percent want tax rebates on energy-efficient vehicles and solar panels, 81 percent want carbon dioxide regulated as a pollutant and 87 percent want more research support for renewable energy.\Yet Republican leaders in Washington are working against these goals. Blinkered by short-term greed and skepticism of science, the Trump administration is scrambling to accelerate oil drilling in sensitive areas, roll back fuel-economy standards, shore up the terminal coal industry and reverse regulations on fracking releases of methane (a gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in heating the atmosphere).\Here in Maine, there's a similarly disorienting split. For eight years, we've had a governor determined to undermine wind power; cut energy-efficiency programs, promote fossil-fuel pipelines and squelch solar power (with vetoes of three separate bills that had widespread support).\Yet in a Maine survey last spring, 77 percent of respondents want political action to dramatically cut global warming pollution by 2030. Even higher percentages seek more electricity from wind and solar along with expansion of energy-efficiency programs.\So why aren't we electing officials who address concerns about climate disruption and support clean energy? Many candidates for office - of both parties - steer clear of even mentioning climate change because in rankings of top voter priorities, it often falls low on the list.\If we want to limit the torrent of greenhouse gasses wreaking havoc with the climate, we'd better start holding politicians' feet to the proverbial (or not so) fire. We need to ask candidates - at all levels - about specific measures they plan to take, and note carefully not only what they say but what they don't.\The stakes are particularly high in Maine's gubernatorial race, where two of the candidates treat energy and environmental concerns like asterisks, barely worthy of mention. When the Energy and Environment Council of Maine (E2Tech) organized a forum in September for gubernatorial candidates, Independent Terry Hayes acknowledged there that she has no policy or position on renewable energy and Republican Shawn Moody simply declined to attend. (Independent Alan Caron and Democrat Janet Mills both committed to a goal of 100 percent renewable energy in Maine by 2030 - up from about 75 percent today - through added wind and solar power and increased energy efficiency.)\In a rare public statement about renewable power, Moody echoed Gov. Paul LePage's mistaken view that it is unaffordable and exclusionary, writing ""we cannot subsidize high-priced sources of energy, or special interests, at the expense of Maine people."" Just for the record, the U.S. already subsidizes fossil fuels at a rate of roughly $26 billion per year (more than three times Maine's annual budget), despite projections that have the cost of renewable energy falling below that of fossil fuels within two years.\Maine's natural resource-based economy could get turned upside down in the coming decades by climate-charged droughts and deluges, ocean acidification, invasive species, and other challenges. Voters deserve details about how candidates will address climate adaptation and mitigate Maine's generation of greenhouse gases. Shawn Moody has just seven sentences on his campaign website under the header ""Protecting Maine's Environment,"" five of which refer to his private auto-body business. That's a shockingly narrow vision in an increasingly interconnected world.\The choice of Maine's next governor carries added importance now because of the environmental backsliding occurring in Washington. More than ever, Maine needs to fortify its environmental protections and work with other state leaders to advance joint initiatives.\After President Trump signaled his intent to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord in June 2017, 17 governors (including those of Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut and Rhode Island) formed a bipartisan alliance to maintain U.S. momentum reducing emissions. That group recently held a Global Climate Action Summit and - joined by Canada and Mexico - pledged to reduce their emissions of methane and other atmospherically destructive pollutants 40 percent by 2030. They also planned measures to make solar-panel installation cheaper and to maintain high energy-efficiency standards for household appliances.\Maine can move toward a brighter future if we elect candidates - up and down the ticket - who are committed to foster clean energy and a healthier environment. But that will happen only if we focus on what matters most, voting with the planet in mind.\ABOUT THE WRITER\MARINA SCHAUFFLER is a freelance journalist and editor whose work is online at www.naturalchoices.com."
170,"
In 2012, Mitt Romney and almost all the other Republican candidates for president raised doubts about the causes and even the existence of global warming, and argued that the government should do nothing to alleviate the problem without further research.
\
This was strange. Only a few years earlier, Romney, along with Newt Gingrich, John McCain and other prominent Republicans, agreed that human activity did contribute to climate change, and even favored government action to reduce the emissions that cause it.
\
Why did they deny what they once acknowledged? The scientific consensus around human-induced climate change has grown stronger through the years, so it could not have been new scientific knowledge.
\
No, they changed their position for purely political reasons: if they did not waffle on that critical issue, they would not win the hard-line Republican base or, perhaps more importantly, the corporate donors they needed to win the Republican nomination.
\
Now, four years later, one sees a similar dynamic.
\
Most Republican presidential candidates continue to favor obfuscation and delay. The largest Republican donors, particularly the Koch Brothers, continue to make waffling a prerequisite for financial support.
\
Meanwhile, many retired Republicans, who no longer need such contributions, have come out strongly for more government action, including George Schultz, Secretrary of the Treasury under Richard Nixon and Secretary of State under Ronald Reagan; Paul O'Neill, Secretary of the Treasury under George W. Bush; Greg Mankiw, key economic adviser for Mitt Romney's campaign; and even Mitt Romney himself.
\
In this new environment, candidates waffling on climate change may win the Republican nomination but lose the general election. People no longer see climate change as a future threat but as a contemporary problem. A Gallup Poll from March 2015 reported that 55 percent of Americans believe climate change is already happening.
\
The costs of natural disasters on U.S. communities have risen dramatically in the past few decades, despite persistent efforts to improve infrastructure to weather such storms.
\
Of course, no one can tell precisely how much climate change contributes to the devastating droughts in California and the Texas panhandle, the increased flooding in the South and Midwest (and elsewhere), or the severity of such superstorms as Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina. But those events have corresponded closely with the predictions of climate change models for years.
\
Even if human activity does contribute to climate change, the naysayers object, the costs of cutting emissions are just too great. Besides, they continue, if the U.S. cuts emissions while China and India do not, then the U.S. will still suffer the effects of climate change, but will lose its competitive edge to adapt to it.
\
Those arguments no longer hold water. A number of recent studies, including one by the International Monetary Fund, have found that the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are far lower than the costs of doing nothing at all. Germany, despite its aggressive environmental policies, remains one of the strongest economies in Europe.
\
Meanwhile, China has been investing heavily in nuclear, wind and solar power in an effort to reach peak emission levels by 2030.
\
Given China's interest, global demand for renewable energy technology is likely to surge in the next decades. If U.S. policy continues to subsidize carbon rather than alternative fuels, it will be unprepared for the shift in markets and suffer in economic competitiveness.
\
And with the United States, China and the European Union all seeking to diminish their dependence on fossil fuels, all other countries in the world will feel pressure to join in or be left behind.
\
Finally, many conservatives, moderates and liberals agree on a policy that promises to reduce emissions while sustaining growth: ""putting a price"" on carbon that asks fossil fuel producers to bear part of the costs that global warming is inflicting on the planet.
\
For example, a revenue-neutral carbon tax would place a fee on the carbon content of fossil fuels and then return the revenues to the population at large. Such a tax would require few regulations and few administrative costs, but would encourage businesses to economize on energy use and search actively for alternative sources. Even major oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP have come out in favor of limiting greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Thus, all the pieces are there for a new direction in climate policy. All that is needed is leadership to put them together.
\
Maine has a long tradition of sending leaders to the U.S. Senate from both parties. Today, Maine is fortunate to have two highly effective Senators who not only acknowledge the human contributions to climate change but have actively supported public action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Because neither are Democrats, they are both well-placed in this highly partisan environment to break the logjam.
\
Now is the time, and this is the issue, to make history.

171,"Agree to disagree\Monty Python once addressed the nature of arguments, an assessment that I feel is much needed. After paying to have an argument, Michael Palin's character walks into a room where John Cleese greets him. They begin bickering, and Cleese simply contradicts everything Palin says. Palin finally breaks down and says: ""An argument isn't the same as a contradiction ... an argument is a collected series of connected statements to establish a definite proposition.""\Palin goes on to say that ""conversation is an intellectual process, whereas contradiction is the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says.""\Our intellectual processes have diminished into gainsaying anything that we disagree with. This saddens me to a very deep extent. I find that we all just want to butt heads when we disagree. Why do we feel the need to fight when we feel the slightest bit threatened by words?\We can learn all we want from traditional methods, but experience doesn't always follow reason or tradition. We all come from different perspectives. Just because someone's opinion seems wacky doesn't mean it has no relevance.\We can accept the chaotic nature of life and still have structure. Not everything needs to be black and white. We are starting to accept this more and more. This does not give people the right to bend any aspect of life to their own liking, it means leaving elbow room for your fellow man.\Though we may take one side and someone else the other, we can still be civil.\Aaron Parks\Caribou\LePage's war on solar\Gov. Paul LePage is waging a war on solar energy in Maine. LD 1649, An Act To Modernize Maine's Solar Power Policy and Encourage Economic Development, has passed the House and Senate and faces an almost certain veto by our bought-by-fossil-fuel-interests governor.\If LePage's veto is not overridden, the Maine Public Utilities Commission will decide how to deal with net metering, which determines compensation for producers of solar electricity. All three commissioners have been appointed by LePage, and if given the opportunity, they are expected to weaken or kill net metering.\What is at stake is the survival of the solar energy industry in Maine. If net metering is eliminated or weakened, companies will be forced to close their doors, good paying solar jobs will be lost and Maine will continue to lag behind other states transitioning to clean energy.\The only way to stop this from happening is to override the veto. At this time both the House and Senate lack the votes to override. Please contact legislators and tell them to stand up for Maine companies and workers and for clean energy.\Mike White\Georgetown\Heath mistaken\Michael Heath's April 14 Bangor Daily News OpEd shocked and appalled. I was quite surprised the BDN chose to publish it. Folks who claim to have the power of the truth within their grasp are often mistaken.\The legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States has, contrary to Heath's understanding, elevated and ennobled our society. We have joined other countries around the world who are enabling humans to strive toward an even more virtuous existence based on love, empathy, fairness and equal freedoms for all.\I expect the narrow mindset of folks like Heath might perhaps be broadened by reading a great variety of literature, study at higher-level institutions and travel. Let's get him a ""free hugs"" T-shirt.\Sally C. Jones\Bangor\Remittances don't help\Immigrants to the United States sent $68 billion in remittances to their families in Latin America last year. I understand their desire to alleviate the poverty of their families in their native lands. But unlike immigration from the past, that $68 billion earned from American jobs is not being spent in American communities. No one suggests we stop this money flow. But it raises the question, should we increase immigration in the future as bipartisan elites are promoting, increasing this financial loss to local businesses?\Remittances increase consumption in poor countries. But this money does not promote the political reforms and structural changes that poor countries need in order to provide their citizens with good jobs and fair government. In fact, just the opposite. Remittances alleviate the pressure on corrupt and wealthy elites to share the wealth and tackle poverty in their countries. How convenient.\What would we think if our politicians encouraged America's poor to run to Canada, defy their immigration laws, provide documentation to help them get driver's licenses, open bank accounts, use Canadian public services, and then scream ""racism"" and ""hate,"" if Canadians began to demand that their immigration laws be enforced?\Julie Tosswill\Hope\Reduce carbon emissions\Earth Day is a good time to reflect on how we each affect the environment. Climate change and ocean acidification are critical issues facing us, and it is urgent to take action. Most experts agree that a global carbon tax is urgently needed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and slow climate change and ocean acidification.\Meanwhile, many of us can take personal action and help to make the transition to a world where the use of fossil fuels is minimized. We can reduce our personal carbon emissions with improved home insulation, better gas mileage, flying and driving less, and purchasing fewer goods. We can also purchase 100 percent Maine-sourced renewable electricity.\Even with such actions, almost all of us will cause the burning of substantial fossil fuels to support our lifestyle. We can help to reduce the effect of this by buying carbon offsets. One source of these is CarbonFund.org. This nonprofit organization sells carbon offsets where the money is used to reduce carbon emissions, using several different approaches. You can choose the approach that you prefer. One approach is to fund renewable sources of electricity that replace electricity generated from fossil fuels. Another is to prevent deforestation. There also are projects that result in more efficient use of electricity.\Maine Green Power offers Mainers the option to use local renewable energy to power their homes with a fixed $3.75 or $7.50 added to their monthly electricity bill. In addition to helping the environment, buying Maine Green Power also supports good jobs within our state.\John Tjepkema\Orono"
172,"Cow burps are a major contributor to global warming, so researchers in Maine and elsewhere in New England are working on something that could get the animals to burp less: a seaweed-based product to add to cow feed, producing an ingredient mix that calms down those bovine digestive tracts.\The researchers at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Boothbay and the University of Vermont will team up over the next few years to figure out which varieties of seaweed do the best job of helping cows produce less methane as they digest their food. They hope to narrow down the varieties through lab tests, then tests on live cows. They're also considering the economics of the additive to figure out if farmers benefit, in addition to the environment.\At Bigelow, researchers can test different seaweed varieties for the chemical compounds that they think will help cows produce less methane as they digest their food. Now, with a $3 million grant from the Shelby Cullom Davis Charitable Fund, they plan to collaborate with the University of Vermont to test a variety of seaweeds through lab tests with simulated cow digestive systems to identify the most promising types of the algae.\The same grant will then help fund field tests for those seaweed varieties, according to Nichole Price, a senior research scientist at Bigelow who directs the lab's Center for Seafood Solutions. Cows at Wolfe's Neck Center for Agriculture and the Environment in Freeport and at the University of New Hampshire will be fed test samples of seaweed additive in 2020 and 2021.\""We are focusing on native Maine seaweeds,"" Price said, adding that the lab will grow some of the algae but also will test seaweed collected in the wild. ""Some wild-harvested species already are used in cow feeds.""\What's already on the market, however, is geared toward animal health rather than environmental protection, she said. Any seaweed additive that proves to help reduce bovine methane emissions also will have to help protect the health of cows, she said, so farmers directly benefit.\""An altruistic benefit isn't going to pay the bills,"" Price said, adding that dairy farming -- the dominant type of cattle farming in New England -- has ""razor-thin"" margins.\To that end Michael Donihue, an economics professor at Colby College, also will be involved in the project to see if the final product might be cost-effective for farmers, Price said.\Researchers expect that any seaweed used to reduce the volume of cow burps will be cultivated instead of wild-harvested, according to Price. Not only has a recent court decision in Maine placed limits on harvesters' access to wild seaweed, but cultivating the algae is a better way to ensure a steady supply of the needed seaweed varieties.\Cultivated seaweed tends to be more expensive, Price acknowledged, but seaweed growers and cattle farmers who produce or use methane-reducing dietary supplements could end up being eligible for carbon tax benefits to help reduce the cost.\Seaweed won't replace the grass or grain that most cows eat now for a few reasons, Price said. Only a small amount of seaweed in a cow's diet is needed for the desired result, she said, which is good because seaweed cannot be harvested or farmed at volumes large enough to become a primary food source for cattle farmers. Plus, Price added, seaweed contains a lot of iodine, and cows can consume only so much of it before it becomes unhealthy.\And it is unlikely that one type of seaweed will prove the ""silver-bullet"" that soothes cow bellies across the globe, she said.\There has been some testing done already on ""confinement herds"" -- cows that are confined and fed a consistent, prepared diet of feed that usually is a blend of grain, corn, soy beans and other food -- but little has been done with pasture-fed cows, which typically eat grass as a significant portion of their diet, according to Price. The types of grass and other wild vegetation eaten by pasture cows varies from one farm to the next, and from year to year or season to season, which can make it more difficult to get a handle on how their food is making them burp.\In New England, near where Maine seaweeds would be grown for the purpose, most cows are used for producing milk rather than beef -- thanks to the high number of dairy cattle in Vermont -- and many of them are pasture-fed. For this reason, Price said, the lab's research will focus on serving dairy herds.\""These trials are expensive and complicated to conduct,"" she said of having live cows eat the test product and then gauging the results. ""That's why we have four pasture trials planned.""\The research raises some interesting possibilities for Maine's seaweed harvesters, said Dave Preston of Ocean Organics in Waldoboro and president of the Maine Seaweed Council, but it is too early to know what kind of impact it could have.\Maine seaweed harvesters already sell a significant amount of their rockweed for use as a dietary health supplement for cows, he said, and it would be ""great"" to have another product to sell to the same customer base.\Even if the research doesn't yield the results some people are hoping for, Preston said, just the fact that serious, well-funded research is happening in Maine bodes well for the state's seaweed industry, which gathered or grew $920,000 worth of seaweed in 2018, all but $100,000 of which was in the form of wild rockweed.\""It is exciting stuff,"" Preston said. ""We love that this research is going on.""\Credit: Bill Trotter BDN Staff"
173,"CANTON ï¿½ Four years ago, Canton artist Laurie Sproul found herself deeply frustrated as she searched for ways that she, as an individual, could take action against what she saw as the impending threat of climate change.\She had come across local environmentalist groups working in their communities but craved something on a grander scale with the potential for ï¿½massive impact.ï¿½ So in the middle of a snowstorm, she and her mother trekked to a climate change conference at the Augusta Civic Center where they ran across a booth for the Citizensï¿½ Climate Lobby, a national group of citizen volunteers who, with laser-like focus, lobby members of Congress for a market-driven solution to carbon emissions. \ï¿½We saw that booth and it was about a national price on carbon, and I looked at (my mom) and said ï¿½this is it!ï¿½ Sproul recalled. ï¿½The more I learn about the proposal that Citizensï¿½ Climate Lobby has put forth, the more it is totally engaging and viable and the more I want to help the public know that thatï¿½s a real solution for climate change.ï¿½\Sproul now volunteers with the Citizensï¿½ Climate Lobby, helping them use art to start conversations about what can arguably be a dry and abstract subject. Along with Winslow-based artist Jean Ann Pollard, Sproul is hoping her art can help break down barriers to discussions on climate change, which over the last decade has transformed from a bipartisan issue ï¿½ albeit with different takes on its causes and solutions ï¿½ to one that is no longer acknowledged by large swaths of one of the countryï¿½s two major political parties.\ï¿½Art is a great communicator,ï¿½ Sproul said. ï¿½It kind of communicates with a deeper, fundamental level in our psyche.ï¿½\This past week Sproul and Pollardï¿½s artwork traveled to Washington, D.C., for the eighth annual Citizenï¿½s Climate Lobby & Citizenï¿½s Climate Education International Conference & Lobby Day, a three-day conference where approximately 1,300 volunteers from chapters across the country gathered to learn how to effectively raise public awareness around climate change and carbon pricing, grow the groupï¿½s ranks and lobby members of Congress to take action. Nearly 1,000 of those volunteers stayed on to lobby staff or officeholders from approximately 500 of the 535 Congressional seats. \By all appearances, it seems there is little executive or legislative will to act on climate change, but behind the scenes the Citizensï¿½ Climate Lobby has been successfully working to build consensus around the groupï¿½s carbon fee and dividend proposal, which proponents say is the most effective, market-friendly, bipartisan and fair approach to curbing carbon emissions.\Originally conceived by Republicans, the model places a fee on carbon dioxide emissions at the point of extraction, such as oil wells or coal mines. All of the proceeds of the carbon fee then go to American households to help offset rising consumer energy costs as energy companies pass their own increased costs down the supply chain and on to consumers. As the price of carbon increases, the model posits, those companies will move away from carbon-based fuels and increase their investment in non-carbon producing energies like solar, wind and nuclear. \In 2016, the Citizensï¿½ Climate Lobby documented 1,391 meetings with staff or members of Congress on the carbon fee, up from 106 in 2010. In the last year, the group generated 40,721 letters to Congress, 2,931 media stories and editorials and held 2,387 outreach events. \That pressure has been making an impact. Each year more members from both sides of the aisle are acknowledging the reality of climate change and the need to take preventive action to avoid its worst effects. A growing number have joined the bipartisan House Climate Solutions Caucus, the brainchild of a Citizensï¿½ Climate Lobby volunteer, which works together on policy responses to the causes and impacts of climate change. \Founded in February 2016, the Climate Solutions Caucus now includes 40 members of Congress, 20 from each party. Members sign up in twos, one Democrat, one Republican, to maintain the groupï¿½s bipartisan balance. At the current rate, the caucus is gaining six new members a month.\Those numbers are notable in a political environment where mention of the words ï¿½climate changeï¿½ can spell disaster for some politicians. Members of the Citizensï¿½ Climate Lobby attribute their success to the groupï¿½s persistent yet respectful approach to lobbying.\ï¿½One of the things that I have found over the years is that the staff and the members of Congress, if you meet them, are very appreciative of the fact that we come in appreciating them for the work they do,ï¿½ said Peter Garrett, regional coordinator for Citizensï¿½ Climate Lobby chapters in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. ï¿½We donï¿½t go into an office unless we have a reason on hand to appreciate them for.ï¿½\Before heading to Capitol Hill, Citizensï¿½ Climate volunteers are expected to do their research on the issues most important to their assigned Congress members in order to figure out how best to frame their arguments about climate change and the groupï¿½s recommended policy response. The group also assigns individual liaisons to each member of Congress. After lobbying days, those liaisons follow up with information to help answer questions or address concerns raised in the meetings. \This past week, Garrett and other volunteers met with staff for all of Maineï¿½s representatives, urging Reps. Bruce Poliquin and Chellie Pingree to join the House Climate Solutions Caucus and pushing for Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King to sponsor carbon pricing legislation and form an equivalent climate working group in the Senate. \In a meeting with staff from Rep. Bruce Poliquinï¿½s office, Garrett saw what he believed was new interest in the groupï¿½s work and policy ideas. Volunteers met with a new member of Poliquinï¿½s staff who seemed to show more interest in the meeting than they had seen in previous years, Garrett said. Though it was clear Poliquin does not favor the groupï¿½s carbon fee and dividend solution, the staff member seemed eager to hear about alternatives.\ï¿½For Poliquin the conversation has really changed,ï¿½ Garrett said. ï¿½In earlier meetings we got the impression that he wasnï¿½t really interested, and so the meeting turned out to be a bit of a marking time kind of effort, but this time the staff person was really listening and we got the impression that so is Bruce Poliquin.ï¿½ \Poliquin spokesman Brendan Conley confirmed the Congressman does not support a climate tax, but said Poliquin ï¿½will be reviewing the details of the Climate Solutions Caucus in Congress.ï¿½\ï¿½The Congressman is a strong supporter of efforts to protect our environment ï¿½ including funding for specific environmental programs in Maine ï¿½ that offer practical solutions to protect our planet and that enhance our stateï¿½s economic growth and competitiveness, two priorities that are not mutually exclusive,ï¿½ Conley wrote in an email.\Staff from Pingreeï¿½s office made clear that Pingree is committed to joining the House climate caucus and needed to find a Republican colleague to join with, Garrett said. \ï¿½She finally, I think, sees now is the time because the caucus has grown to a sufficient size that she sees that she really has to be part of it,ï¿½ Garrett said. ï¿½Before I think it was kind of a wait and see.ï¿½\In an email, Pingree spokesman Andrew Colvin said the Congresswoman is interested in joining the caucus and sees ï¿½definite potential in the carbon fee and dividend approach, but, as in all issues, (the Congresswoman) would need to see the details of an exact proposal to see if it would work as expected.ï¿½\In conversations with staff for Sen. Susan Collins this week, Garrett said the group ran through the proposal they would like Collins to put forward and learned that because Collins does not sit on the relevant Senate committee she would need to find another, better positioned Republican colleague to work with. \For Sen. Angus King, already well-versed in the science of climate change, the issue was one of personal political capital and how best to use that capital to make an impact. King has a habit of passing out business-sized cards filled with climate data to his colleagues in the Senate, Garrett said. \ï¿½Each of them comes at it from a somewhat different angle, and the skill of we as volunteer lobbyists is to recognize and to acknowledge that theyï¿½re not all like a collection of dominos,ï¿½ Garrett said. ï¿½Each of them have particular concerns, so how do we meet them?ï¿½\The volunteers use the results of a 2014 study commissioned by the Citizensï¿½ Climate Lobby to help make their case. The study found that if Congress levied a $10 fee on fuel producers for every metric ton of carbon dioxide they produced in 2016, a fee that would then rise by $10 increments each year, it would create 2.1 million more jobs, prevent 13,000 premature deaths a year and result in a 33 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2025 compared with a model that did not include the fee. By 2035, those numbers would jump to 2.8 million more jobs, more than 14,000 fewer deaths a year and a 52 percent decrease in emissions.\The study also found that through the dividend, U.S. households would receive $400 billion a year by 2025, or approximately $300 per month for a family of four, to help offset their energy costs. Researchers found carbon fees would hasten the closing of coal plants and lead to increased investment in energies like wind, solar and nuclear power, adding an additional $80 billion to $90 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product.\The findings were not universally positive, however. Even with the dividend, the fee would increase Americansï¿½ cost of living by around three percent by 2025. While most states would see job growth, energy-producing states like Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas would lose jobs and experience a decline in their gross regional product (or GDP for the region). \Real world case studies support much of the 2014 studyï¿½s findings. There are at least 40 carbon pricing programs around the world from Sweden to British Columbia that have helped decrease emissions while maintaining business competitiveness, says Thomas Tietenberg, Mitchell Family Professor of Economics Emeritus at Colby College.\Tietenberg spent more than 30 years studying economic approaches to environmental protection and in that time became convinced, along with most of the worldï¿½s economists, he argues, that the most effective and cheapest means of reducing carbon emissions is through carbon pricing.\ï¿½One of the interesting things to me is how many businesses actually support the carbon tax,ï¿½ Tietenberg said. ï¿½They want certainty and they think that some kind of control on carbon is going to be absolutely essential. If you delay it, then youï¿½ll have less time to act and will have to do more stringent things to act, so itï¿½s going to be more expensive.ï¿½\Tietenberg supports the fee and dividend model specifically because he believes it is ultimately more fair to consumers, especially poorer consumers, than a tax. Any price increase on carbon will inevitably make its way through the supply chain to consumers. For lower income Americans, that translates to a higher proportion of their income going toward energy costs.\ï¿½With rebates, all of the revenues go back to the people in a monthly dividend, and the way theyï¿½re done is in such a way that basically two thirds of people would end up better off financially than before the tax. That is to say the rebate would be greater than their actual increase in expenditures on the energy,ï¿½ Tietenberg said. \At the heart of the Citizenï¿½s Climate Lobbyï¿½s success is its growing legion of volunteers who, armed with facts and an urgent sense of mission, create sustained pressure on U.S. representatives to take on climate change and consider a carbon fee and dividend in their efforts to reduce emissions.\The group harnesses communicators of all stripes to make the case to Americans and their representatives that every individual is empowered to work to prevent the worst effects of climate change.\For Winslow artist Jean Ann Pollard, whose artwork was featured at this weekï¿½s Citizensï¿½ Climate conference, it is precisely the groupï¿½s citizens focused approach that makes the Citizenï¿½s Climate Lobby so effective. \ï¿½Itï¿½s bottom up,ï¿½ Pollard said. ï¿½Where it should have been all along.ï¿½\Credit: By KATE MCCORMICK Staff Writer"

And third, a device could easily be designed and built that could be used to check the compressibility of the ball before and after each play. The NFL has found fault with Brady and the Patriots, but have they looked at their own faults?\Fred Otto\Orono"
177,"In his July 7 letter to the editor, John Frary predicts ruinous costs to Maine's 2nd District from carbon cap-and-trade legislation passed by the House and being considered in the Senate. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated such a program would cost $175 per household annually, a figure that does not include benefits, such as energy efficiency, not having to breathe in so much pollution, and a slowing of the effects of climate change.\One wonders what Mr. Frary would propose if he doesn't like cap and trade - a carbon tax? Continuing as we are now? In fact, as Yale Environment 360 points out, ""the days of freely dumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere are coming to an end."" Those concerned about U.S. energy independence and climate change agree that emitting carbon is no longer going to be free.\If the U.S. doesn't start soon on developing clean energy technologies, it will be left in the dust economically by countries that do - such as China, already an innovator in renewable energy. For that reason, the cap-and-trade option has attracted many supporters - including big businesses such as General Electric, Dow Chemical, Shell Oil and Duke Energy.\I commend Maine's representatives, Mike Michaud and Chellie Pingree, for voting for the cap-and-trade bill in the House, and urge Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins to support a strong bill curbing greenhouse gases. Our future depends on it.\Christina Diebold\Bangor"

183,"There is an old wooden trunk full of ugly sweaters in my mom's bedroom.\Some of these sweaters are pullovers and some are button-downs. Most were acquired in thrift stores, yard sales and by other second- and thirdhand means. Many contain the highly questionable large floral patterns of the late '80s and early '90s. But what all of these sweaters have in common is that they are made of 100 percent wool. The itchy kind.\When I'm the only person at home, I usually keep the thermostat at about 55 degrees. It's not a super-comfortable temperature. That's where the trunk of sweaters comes in. One of those keeps me toasty, so I can both save money on fuel oil and lower household greenhouse-gas emissions, because I'm burning less fuel. (If you are wondering about the dog's temperature, don't worry, she has a sweater collection, too, but hers are cuter.)\Anyway, I think about climate change every single day, and while there are basic solutions we should enact immediately in order to stave off the worst effects of dumping greenhouse gases into our atmosphere, including a carbon tax, investments in renewable energy, eating a plant-based diet and the end of government subsidies to oil, we may also have to come up with some more creative solutions.\So I had the idea: What about government-subsidized wool sweaters?\Seriously, Maine is full of sheep, and presumably spinning wheels, and I know for a fact we have a ton of knitters. Why not a program that gives every resident of the state a properly fitting wool sweater? It would support locally owned businesses and artisans while at the same time helping people to cut down on their heating bills and the attendant pollution!\(Mom asked me: Why not wool blankets? While cheaper and easier to produce, blankets are inconvenient to wear when you have to move around the house. Trust me, I have tried every technique of wearing a blanket, and they always find a way to slide off.)\While we are at it, I think we need to bring back horses in a major way. They can be used for transportation (who doesn't love horse-drawn carriages?) and agriculture (plowing, hauling), and, unlike many creatures, their poop is actually useful as fertilizer. We would definitely have to beef up animal welfare laws, of course, but for a quick run to the grocery store, why shouldn't you just be able to get a pair of horses to trot you a couple of miles? (I haven't come up with the app name yet. ""Karriage""? ""HorS""? ""Pony Up""?)\Maine has plenty of space to raise horses - maybe we could export them to other states. And besides, once Scarborough Downs eventually goes belly-up, there will be quite a few horses out of a job. Growing the amount of hay needed to feed the horses would involve a great deal of carbon capture. Not to mention all the carrots for treats.\We are a state with a great deal of windy coastline, which means we should get offshore windmills going as soon as possible. Despite the good it could do for our state, the economy and the environment, a small number of people who don't want to have to see a windmill on the horizon will complain to the high heavens and the local zoning board as soon as this is suggested.\But you know what else Maine has in large quantities, in addition to sheep and wind? Artists. My proposal is the homeowners and horizon-viewers who would be within eyesight of a windmill or wind turbine or floating energy platform receive an exclusive piece of artwork from a local Maine artist. Painting, sculpture, mixed media - whatever their preference is, they would get beautiful art available to nobody else to hang in their living room to look at when they got tired of the ocean views that now would include a windmill.\I fully admit these are silly suggestions and not universally applicable. (Nobody needs wool sweaters in Hawaii.) But the simple solutions to the problems caused by climate change - including, step No. 1, stop making the problem worse by burning fossil fuels - have been ignored for years. People just aren't willing to do boring, practical things that might not make them a bunch of money, even when the future of our livable planet is at stake. And if you don't think climate change is a problem, just take a look at Maine's rising rates of Lyme disease, carried by ticks, which are spreading faster than we can pick them off. So my hope is, maybe people will respond to silly (but creative) ideas instead. Maybe sweaters and horses and artwork could really help.\After all, what have we got to lose?\Victoria Hugo-Vidal is a Maine millennial.

2nd District race in presidential election year expected to be costly
\
The 2016 campaign in Maine's 2nd Congressional District kicked off Tuesday when Democrat Emily Cain said that she will seek a rematch with freshman U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin.

186,"
Thousands of Chinese are fleeing to the United States. We are not talking about impoverished peasants hiding in cargo containers. We're talking about millionaires flying first class and buying condos in the choicest ZIP codes. A big reason for this relocation, real estate agents say, is a desire for America's clean air, as opposed to China's suffocating smog.
\
Welcome to the new world of environmental immigration. These are not the ""huddled masses"" immortalized on the Statue of Liberty's poem, but they are -- quite literally -- ""yearning to breathe free.""
\
One can see the point of leaving China if you have the resources. Rust-colored toxic wastes choke its rivers. Sooty air makes eyes itch. And public health crises in some industrial towns have reached the level that they're being called ""cancer villages."" Who wants to expose the family to that if you can live under Boston's blue skies and in close proximity to the select U.S. universities you want your kids to attend anyway.
\
About a quarter of recent buyers for Boston's top luxury condos have been foreign investors, especially from China and other parts of Asia. A local entrepreneur, Patty Chen, runs a soup-to-nuts relocation service, American Asia Business Tour Group-Boston, helping out with immigration visas, real estate services, and advice on schools and neighborhoods.
\
Manhattan has experienced a similar rush of Chinese buyers. Michael Chen at the brokerage firm Bond New York cites their preference for New York's fresh air and ""better family and work/life balance."" Guess it's all relative.
\
How bad is the pollution back in China? A recent study published by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences found that Chinese living in their country's heavily industrial north die on average five years earlier than those living in the south. Reliance on coal-fired heating and factories is largely to blame.
\
China has been the world's third-most popular tourist destination, after France and the United States. But the number of visitors there fell 5 percent this year. The China National Tourism Administration cites the smog as a big factor keeping people away. Beijing saw a steeper, 15 percent, drop in foreign travelers. More and more businesspeople are reportedly trying to get moved out of Beijing for health reasons.
\
For decades, corrupt Communist Party leaders have squandered their natural heritage in their push to create jobs -- and stay in power. The policy has also enriched their families and cronies feasting off the big, dirty industrial machine. But now environmental squalor is beginning to be bad for business -- as well as stirring social unrest, which is about time.
\
The government has started sponsoring studies on ways to lessen pollution, both the noxious type you breathe and the invisible planet-warming gases from the same sources. Proposals include a carbon tax on fossil fuels and a national carbon credit market. Sound familiar?
\
Environmental segregation is not unknown in the United States. Affluent precincts in this country maintain pristine surroundings, while poorer ones often get the smokestacks, waste facilities and lax regulations.
\
But Americans never let things reach the point that their rich citizens immigrated in massive numbers to cleaner countries. And to their credit, Americans have accepted the loss of some competitive advantage in global manufacturing as a necessary price to pay for protecting our natural surroundings.
\
The alarm is sounding for China's elite to also address the trade-off between explosive economic growth and environmental degradation. Jobs versus early death should be a topic for national debate.
\
You wonder whether China's environment would have been allowed to get so putrid if rich Chinese had to gasp the same air as the toilers. One can't blame them for wanting to escape, but still you wonder.

The 2016 campaign in Maine's 2nd Congressional District kicked off Tuesday when Democrat Emily Cain said that she will seek a rematch with freshman U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin.
\
The move by Cain, a 34-year-old former state senator from Orono, was widely expected and sets up what promises to be one of the priority national races for the U.S. House of Representatives next year, but it came 20 months before Election Day and just two months after the Republican congressman's swearing-in.
\
After Cain's announcement Tuesday, a news release from the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House majority's campaign arm, led with one word: ""Yawn.""
\
Two potential primary rivals said Cain's announcement won't scare them away. Michael Cuzzi, a Democratic strategist who has worked for President Barack Obama, said he's ""not surprised that Emily is running, but I'm surprised that the announcement has come this early.""
\
""Poliquin hasn't really had a chance to establish a record that provides Emily with a compelling case to run against,"" Cuzzi said, ""so what this ends up looking like is a continuation of the last campaign rather than the launch of a new campaign.""
\
In an interview, Cain said while she was proud of her last campaign, the next one must be ""even stronger."" She said she announced early to ""include as many people as possible"" in that effort.
\
""There's no question this is going to have to be bigger, and this is going to take a lot of work and a lot of time from a lot of people,"" Cain said.
\
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been pushing Cain to run ever since she lost the November election to Poliquin, gaining just 42 percent of votes. Their 2014 race was the most expensive U.S. House race in Maine history with outside groups spending $3 million trying to get Cain or Poliquin elected. But since the modern-era 2nd District was created in the 1960s, no incumbent has ever lost.
\
Both parties are bracing themselves for an expensive contest in 2016. Poliquin is one of 12 House members in a national Republican program for vulnerable incumbents, while Democrats have dubbed him one of 15 vulnerable Republican ""one-term wonders,"" expecting their party to be in a good position to gain seats in a presidential election year. On Tuesday, the DCCC targeted Poliquin in a round of robo-calls to voters in 29 Republican districts attacking members on Department of Homeland Security funding.
\
Cain's 2014 campaign was built on a message of compromise, touting her work ""staying at the table"" to negotiate with Republicans for a decade in the Maine Legislature. In a June primary, she easily beat Troy Jackson, a logger and labor Democrat from Allagash who criticized her for voting for tax cuts ""for the rich.""
\
Cuzzi, a Maine Sunday Telegram columnist, said national Democrats see ""a stronger opportunity for Emily to prevail in a presidential year,"" but Democratic primary voters have undergone an ""ideological hardening"" since the 2014 elections, referencing an effort to draft liberal U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to run for the party's presidential nod in 2016 against Hillary Clinton. He said primary voters now might be ""looking for someone who will stand and fight for core Democratic principles rather than trying to govern and deliver pragmatic compromise.""
\
On Tuesday, Jackson, now a Democratic national committeeman from Maine, said he's thinking of running again. He said Cain's announcement wouldn't push him out and that Poliquin won his campaign by staking out strong conservative positions.
\
""When it comes down to their issue, I don't think people care about who's partisan,"" Jackson said. ""They want people to fight for them and get results.""
\
Bangor city councilors Ben Sprague and Joe Baldacci have said they're considering primary runs in 2016. But on Tuesday, Sprague ended speculation about a run, saying he plans to ""help grow the Maine economy from the municipal level of government"" and that Cain would make a great representative.
\
However, when asked whether Cain's entry changed anything for him, Baldacci said no.
\
""I think we all expected her to make another attempt,"" he said.
\
On Tuesday, Poliquin's political consultant, Brent Littlefield, issued a statement saying Cain's ""Washington advisers are quite desperate to tap into her donors,"" but ""they should hold onto their purses and wallets.""
\
Since his election, Poliquin, a Republican, has rankled some activists in his party. Notably, he voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act, saying while he opposes it, his party must have a law ready to replace it. Littlefield said Poliquin ""is rejecting politics as usual,"" renewing a 2014 campaign attack on Cain's support of a carbon tax, saying it's one of her ""expensive, extreme policies.""
\
But Cain called Poliquin's health care vote ""very political,"" saying he has voted against abortion rights and the environment. He has backed a bill aimed at prohibiting taxpayer-funded abortions and supports the Keystone XL pipeline, and Cain said he hasn't been centrist so far.
\
""What we've seen is that he's just as extreme as ever and that he's as political as ever,"" she said.

188,"Congress may soon face a matter that has the potential to divide people across Maine and the country: whether to renew a federal tax credit that helps wind power compete with other sources of electricity. The tax break costs about $1 billion per year and is set to expire Dec. 31. Though it has historically been renewed with support from both parties, the credit this year became a point of political division in the presidential race and Maine's U.S. Senate race.\Whether the tax credit is extended should come down to financial and societal considerations: whether the country can pay for it without going into debt and whether making the wind energy industry more competitive is worth the upfront costs.\Particular communities understandably feel strongly about the credit -- which subsidizes wind power by 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour -- because they see it as helping developers to disrupt the environment and the aesthetics of their surroundings. But when discussing the credit it's important to separate out its real effect. The credit may make it more affordable for a developer to install turbines, but state laws and local ordinances determine where a wind farm is located.\Here are some questions Congress should answer before deciding whether to extend the credit:\Should wind be a growing part of the country's renewable energy mix? It already plays a significant role. In 2011 wind power represented 32 percent of all newly developed electric capacity. It's estimated that the average wind farm worldwide will be fully competitive by 2016, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. In some cases, electricity generated by wind is already competitive with electricity produced by fossil fuels. The operations and maintenance of wind farms is becoming cheaper, and they are becoming more efficient in terms of their electricity output.\Has the tax credit been effective? The Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit's goal is to keep electricity rates low and spur development of renewable energy projects. The credit has helped the wind energy industry lower costs; and 60 percent of a wind turbine's value is now produced in the United States, compared with 25 percent prior to 2005, according to the American Wind Energy Association. The link between the credit and wind power development is clear: In the years it was allowed to expire, installations fell between 73 and 93 percent.\Is the tax credit still needed? It's essential that the credit not become permanent. It was designed to be an incentive, not a reward. But there is great debate about when, exactly, it should end. Many people do not support having the credit end abruptly, however, and the idea of a phase-out schedule has been raised. If Congress decides to extend the credit in the coming weeks, its ultimate end date will likely depend on what happens with other government policies, such as renewable energy portfolio standards, which generate a market for renewable energy.\The wind industry as a whole is lobbying for the credit's extension, but fiscal conservatives have opposed it, saying taxpayers' investment so far has resulted in inadequate return. But several Republican governors and lawmakers from wind-rich states support it. The American Wind Energy Association reported that 81 percent of wind turbines are in districts represented by the GOP.\How should the credit be paid for? If the country is trying to seriously reduce the deficit but maintain some of the Bush-era tax cuts, this is not the time to go into debt to pay for the tax credit. It's possible a carbon tax could pay for it. Or Congress could cut back on fossil fuel subsidies. Though it would be politically difficult to accomplish, the Obama administration has committed to phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, as discussed at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh in 2009.\A decision about the credit's extension should be made with consideration of how it's paid for and to what extent it's worth investing money. It's a difficult topic, as an entire industry lies in the balance. Having the right questions, though, is a good place to start."
189,"Finding truth about Kavanaugh\The Senate Judiciary Committee could easily have found out the truth about the Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford controversy. All they had to do was subpoena Mark Judge, the other person in the bedroom, according to Ford.\Republicans on the committee also refused to hear the questions of the prosecutor they themselves had hired.\Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee were more interested in protecting their nominee than learning the truth.\Sen. Susan Collins must vote against the flawed candidate Kavanaugh.\Nancy Allen\Brooksville\Climate change an urgent problem\Humans emit 30 billion to 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide yearly; the U.S. contributes about 8 billion tons. The present level CO2 in the atmosphere, about 400 parts per million, is the highest in 800,000 years. We have been warned that continuing at this rate is a threat to every living thing on earth. The future of humanity is here, on this planet. Our kids and all the kids who come after them. All those bright-eyed innocent kids wanting to play on God's green earth. Here. On this planet. The one we live on right now.\We know we cannot stop global warming. The CO2 we already emit into the atmosphere will make this place a lot warmer: more drought, wildfires, severe storms, methane as the permafrost thaws. The list is long.\Fossil fuels need to stay in the ground. Time is not on our side. Waiting is not working and we know it. We need to put a price on carbon, support renewable energy, and vote for candidates who will do the same. This is the very least we can do.\Recently, the House, including Rep. Bruce Poliquin, voted 229-184 on a resolution opposing a carbon tax because it would be detrimental to our economy, they said. Our economy can grow without using fossil fuels, but with continued use there will not be an economy. There will be no life on earth. This is urgent.\Poliquin voted for this resolution. Don't vote for Poliquin.\Douglas Poulin\Hampden\PTC criticism misguided\In her review of the Penobscot Theatre Co.'s recent production of ""The Graduate,"" Judy Harrison takes unfair aim at Producing Artistic Director Bari Newport's selection of ""The Graduate"" and ""Mama Mia!"" to bookend the theater's season. Unlike most nonprofit arts organizations, almost 80 percent of Penobscot Theatre's income is generated by ticket sales; it is Newport's job to program works that excite and engage the community, and that is what she has done.\Under Newport's tenure, the Penobscot Theatre has expanded its offerings, added showtimes, demonstrated new technical prowess, and greatly enhanced production values, all the while programming diverse works that are both challenging and entertaining, and growing its educational programming tenfold.\It is Harrison's job to be critical of ""The Graduate"" (though audiences, myself included, have loved it), but her attack on Newport's selection of ""The Graduate"" and ""Mama Mia!"" for the 45th season is misguided at best.\Katie Schaffer\Bangor\Liberman a fair district attorney\The people of Sagadahoc, Lincoln, Knox and Waldo counties are very fortunate to have Jon Liberman as their district attorney, and I hope you will join me in voting to elect him.\Liberman is very tough on crime and makes sure that those who commit them are held accountable. I am particularly impressed with his advocacy for victims of crime. He fights to protect victims' privacy rights and secure financial restitution for them.\While he is tough on offenders, Liberman is also fair and is always looking for ways for offenders to rehabilitate themselves when possible. He is a strong advocate of community-based restorative justice for juvenile offenders that encourages them to take responsibility for their actions and become productive members of society.\He is also working to establish a ""drug court"" in midcoast Maine. This unique approach to helping addicts recover has had tremendous success elsewhere in Maine.\It is this type of innovative approach to prosecuting crime that has made Liberman such an effective district attorney, and I hope you will join me in voting to elect him on Nov. 6.\Mike Thibodeau\Maine Senate president\Winterport\Mills for governor\My vote is for Janet Mills for governor because she respects the will of the people and will govern accordingly.\A vote for Shawn Moody is a vote for a continuation of the LePage agenda -- ""governing"" by obstructing. He has promised to follow Gov. Paul LePage's legacy.\LePage issued nearly 200 more vetoes in office than nearly every other governor since 1917, combined. And he refused to enact the voter-approved Medicaid expansion and let a bill that would have effectively killed ranked-choice voting become law. Apparently, it's OK to waste money on obstructing the functioning of state government.\Mills' experience in the Legislature prepared her well for working with legislators from both parties to move the state forward after eight years of dismal economic growth and current projections of nearly zero job creation over the next decade.\A vote for Mills is a vote to move the state forward and away from the failed policies of Republicans led by LePage.\Jennifer Jones\Falmouth\King no political pawn\Sen. Angus King is a politician who, like Sens. Margaret Chase Smith, William Cohen and George Mitchell, has served Maine and the country with integrity and common sense.\With foresight and courage, the senator announced that he would not vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh. Lifetime appointments should require substantial bipartisan support, but this process, too rushed and flawed, became downright ugly when accusations of Kavanaugh's sexual misconduct surfaced. But King didn't wait for this debacle to make his decision. After closely studying Kavanaugh's judicial record, King found it raised questions about issues we both support, such as health care for everyone, women's equality, civil rights and protection of the environment. Thus, King decided Kavanaugh should not be on the Supreme Court.\Not a pawn for any political party, King studies the issues, uses research and reason to find the best course of action, and joins others across party lines to make that happen. Let's continue the proud Maine tradition of sending outstanding leaders to Washington by voting for King this November.\Anne Wescott Dodd\Brunswick\"

191,"Marijuana instead of heroin\The failure of the Maine secretary of state to allow the marijuana initiative on the November ballot is a squandered opportunity to help our fight against heroin addiction. Available, affordable marijuana may very well be the choice in lieu of heroin for those contemplating the issue. Marijuana should be offered free to those who are trying to convert. We probably could get Maine farmers to donate a portion of their crops for a tax break along the way.\This will not solve the heroin problem in total but could help put a dent in it. The state's leadership should give this some thought. It doesn't make any difference to me if marijuana is legal, but I am thinking it could be another tool in the toolbox in this fight.\John Friedman\Eddington\Join Sanders' revolution\A political revolution is sweeping this nation -- one born out of compassion and inclusiveness. Maine, hear the call of the youth, answer our beckoning for a more equal world. We don't dream of a utopia but of amelioration. We don't dream of a perfect world, only a better one.\The campaign of Bernie Sanders is only the facilitator. His support represents a massive swelling of the disenfranchised, impoverished and folks who are sick and tired of being sick and tired. Shall we seek out a better world? Join us, and we will make it.\Evan Livonius\Etna\Benghazi disqualifies Clinton\I cannot believe that anyone who has served in the military or had a son, daughter, brother or sister serve would even consider supporting Hillary Clinton for president. She, in her capacity as secretary of state, and President Barack Obama abandoned the Navy SEALs, who were under their direct orders to rescue Americans on Sept. 11, 2012, in Benghazi, Libya. Clinton and Obama went to bed to sleep while these men were killed.\Dola Carter\St. Francis\Keep pets inside\Although weather reports warned viewers to bundle up for the cold this winter, there wasn't a reminder for us to consider bringing inside pets, farm animals or both. I think news and weather reporters would provide a nice public service by reminding people that animals also benefit from being inside, too.\Animals suffer from frostbite just as people do, and many must endure cold winter weather without adequate shelter. The media should consider adding animals to their reminders to get in out of the cold weather.\Sandra Joy\Bangor\Protect all students from predators\On Feb. 1, the Bangor Daily News published an article about a former Waldo County automotive instructor who sexually assaulted a student. Upon his sentencing, it was made clear he would be prohibited from having unsupervised contact with women under the age of 18.\Why limit the protection to only students under the age of 18, when all students in elementary or secondary schools should be protected from sexual assault from school officials, regardless of their age? The students could be 18, 19 or 20 years old.\The passage of LD 1540, An Act to Protect All Students in Elementary or Secondary Schools from Sexual Assault by School Officials, will remove the age limit from the current statute to extend protection to all students, regardless of their age. With this bill under consideration in the state Senate, it is my hope that this bill will pass and be signed into law to protect our vulnerable youth.\Michelle J. Agnese\Tremont\Economy benefits from carbon tax\My partner and I recently bought a modest house in Bangor and did a serious energy retrofit. We not only reduced our energy costs and became more energy independent, we also provided work for a number of local businesses.\It would be great if more Mainers could enjoy the same savings. The carbon fee and dividend proposed by the Citizens' Climate Lobby is a market-based way to help make that happen. If enacted by Congress, this legislation would place a gradually rising fee on fossil fuels at their source and return all the money to American households on an equal basis. This would protect the majority of low- and middle-income households from higher prices on carbon-based products.\Bringing the cost of fossil fuels more in line with their true cost will provide strong market incentives to encourage new jobs in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Ending the subsidies for fossil fuels and the carbon emissions they generate is a fair solution with support from leading members of both major political parties.\The Citizens' Climate Lobby is reaching out to Maine's congressional delegation, asking them to meet to discuss the carbon fee and dividend while Congress is on spring break. This will be a great opportunity for our members of Congress to hear from Maine residents and to discuss a proposal that could be of great benefit to Maine's people, environment and economy. We encourage them to make time in their schedule to meet.\Karen Marysdaughter\Bangor\Cruz for president\President Barack Obama has proven to be one of the worst presidents from his failed policies of Obamacare to the Iran nuclear dea l. Instead of uniting people, he is a divider. His refusal to even meet with Israel's leader shows his bad judgment as the leader of the free world. I can't wait for the day he is out of office.\But if Hillary Clinton is elected in November, all of Obama's bad policies will be upheld as she has promised to do. As if the North American Free Trade Agreement wasn't bad enough, Congress is working to authorize the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\The media wonders how Donald Trump could be so popular, but look where our leaders have gotten us in the last 20 years. Voters are angry and frustrated with Washington. We have failed as a nation.\My choice for president in November will be Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. He will uphold the U.S. Constitution. He will be a real leader. Republicans and Democrats in Washington are afraid of him because under Cruz, Congress won't get away with a lot of things that it does now.\Bonnie Lane\Sherman"
192,"In an old crime series called “Dragnet,” Detective Joe Friday always said, “Just the facts, ma’am, just the facts.”\Let us try and do that as we analyze our current political choices in the runup to our next general election. Let us also try to get beyond the personal hate of the key players — no TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) vilification of Trump or Pocahontas epithets of Elizabeth Warren allowed. Just the facts, or as Peggy Noonan in the “Wall Street Journal” so cogently stated, “Everyone knows the truth about politics.”\Well, what do we know? We know that the conservative platform is based upon a foundation of free market capitalism. This freewill system of personal opportunity gives each citizen an unchecked right to pursue his or her dreams of personal and economic goals. Importantly, it does not guarantee outcomes. Outcomes will differ depending upon effort, ingenuity, perseverance and society’s need or acceptance of what each of us has to offer.\This system is working, supported by two current facts — the Labor Department reported just last month that job openings exceeded the number of unemployed Americans by 1.2 million, and the median household income rose to nearly $62,000 — a record high in the American Community Survey. This fact underpins the fundamental conservative belief in a free society of self-determination and self-reliance.\This brings us to the role of government.\Conservatives are often accused of being anti-government. Not true — they espouse limited government. They support government services that are necessary for a well-ordered society: police, fire, courts, postal, educational and medical.\Of course, critics will quickly challenge the latter two. However, while conservatives support a basic public education system, they reserve the right to pursue individual choices for their children. This includes the right to not participate in the public system and to home-school children or to opt for a non-traditional approach and enroll children in parochial or private schools. After all, isn’t this why we have public and private universities which have served our country well for over 200 years?\Similarly, conservatives believe that people should have a choice with respect to their medical services. Medicare and Medicaid for those citizens whom our government determines should receive services, based upon age or disability, are absolutely supported. Further, public health and emergency services — with the right to opt out or to pursue other services through personal or employer support is part of the conservative platform. Facts!\Now, let us take a look at what the progressives are proposing for us in the Democratic debates. There is no question that their platform has moved dramatically to the left in stark contrast to the free-market capitalism described above. In fact, the party has lurched so far leftward that one candidate, Joe Biden, is viewed by some Democrats as the preferred choice for no other reason than he is seen as somewhat moderate. Perhaps this fact more than any other best illustrates how much the future of the country is poised upon the choice between freewill capitalism and socialism — or democratic socialism as apologists call it.\Whether it be Biden or Elizabeth Warren, the left’s agenda can, indeed, be fairly identified as socialism. In fact, this socialist agenda is openly promoted by the Midcoast Branch of Democratic Socialists of America. What is that agenda? Here are the facts — taken directly from current poll leader Warren’s website. So, let’s examine them. Nomenclature is everything and so Warren, audaciously, titles her socialist platform the “Accountable Capitalism Act.” Her “capitalism” is Medicare for all, free college education, guaranteed minimum wage, a carbon tax, repeal of illegal immigration statues, no limits on abortion, slavery reparations, and elimination of the Electoral College.\Concomitantly, there is a mind-numbing cost for this, and the sheer impact of how it will be funded absolutely defines socialism.\Here are the facts of how she proposes to fund this “capitalism.” Shareholder companies would be required to change focus from profit to the interests of “the work force,” the “community,” and the “local and global environment.” Companies with receipts over $1 billion would pay a heavy surtax. With confiscatory profit containment, and without shareholder direction and investment, entrepreneurship would surely end.\Under this mantle of suppression, who would ever strive to create or invest in a large business? In fact, who would want to start a small business — knowing that the socialist (excuse me, “capitalist”) bureaucrats would be coming for them next? Free enterprise as we know it today would end.\But it gets worse. In what is the clearest evidence of Warren’s socialism, she wants to tax the accumulated wealth of the American citizenry. And who, exactly, are they? Retirees!\The Federal Reserve tells us that people between the ages of 55 and 74 own 73% of common stocks and the same share of America’s wealth. This is where Bill de Blasio’s, “Americans have a lot of money, it’s just in the wrong hands” comes in.\Warren would tax this wealth, including a proposed tax on unrealized capital gains. Socialists endorse this re-distribution of wealth. But is it fair to punish those who have spent a lifetime working and saving over the course of their careers? Further, while the average wealth of this targeted age group appears high, the much-fairer median wealth is far lower ($234,000, which is less than a quarter of the average) and includes the value of their biggest asset — their homes. Facts!\In this election, Americans will have a clear choice. Examine the free enterprise and socialist facts of the campaigns and choose between the capitalist system that built this great country, or the socialist system that, while redistributing wealth, destroys it.\Is the hate for Donald Trump worth the tragic end of our American way of life?\Another View is a weekly column written collaboratively by Dale Landrith of Camden, Ken Frederic of Bristol, Paul Ackerman of Martinsville, Jan Dolcater of Rockport and Ralph “Doc” Wallace of Rockport."

The media should consider adding animals to their reminders to get in out of the cold weather.\Sandra Joy\Bangor\Protect all students from predators\On Feb. 1, the Bangor Daily News published an article about a former Waldo County automotive instructor who sexually assaulted a student. Upon his sentencing, it was made clear that he would be prohibited from having unsupervised contact with women under the age of 18.\Why limit the protection to only students under the age of 18, when all students in elementary or secondary schools should be protected from sexual assault from school officials, regardless of their age? The students could be 18, 19 or 20 years old.\The passage of LD 1540, An Act to Protect All Students in Elementary or Secondary Schools from Sexual Assault by School Officials, will remove the age limit from the current statute to extend protection to all students, regardless of their age. With this bill under consideration in the state Senate, it is my hope that this bill will pass and be signed into law to protect our vulnerable youth.\Michelle J. Agnese\Tremont\Economy benefits from carbon tax\My partner and I recently bought a modest house in Bangor and did a serious energy retrofit. We not only reduced our energy costs and became more energy independent, we also provided work for a number of local businesses.\It would be great if more Mainers could enjoy the same savings. The carbon fee and dividend proposed by the Citizens' Climate Lobby is a market-based way to help make that happen. If enacted by Congress, this legislation would place a gradually rising fee on fossil fuels at their source, and return all the money to American households on an equal basis. This would protect the majority of low- and middle-income households from higher prices on carbon-based products.\Bringing the cost of fossil fuels more in line with their true cost will provide strong market incentives to encourage new jobs in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Ending the subsidies for fossil fuels and the carbon emissions they generate is a fair solution with support from leading members of both major political parties.\The Citizens' Climate Lobby is reaching out to Maine's congressional delegation, asking them to meet to discuss the carbon fee and dividend while Congress is on spring break. This will be a great opportunity for our members of Congress to hear from Maine residents, and to discuss a proposal that could be of great benefit to Maine's people, environment and economy. We encourage them to make time in their schedule to meet.\Karen Marysdaughter\Bangor\Cruz for president\President Barack Obama has proven to be one of the worst presidents from his failed policies of Obamacare to the Iran nuclear dea l. Instead of uniting people, he is a divider. His refusal to even meet with Israel's leader shows his bad judgment as the leader of the free world. I can't wait for the day he is out of office.\But if Hillary Clinton is elected in November, all of Obama's bad policies will be upheld as she has promised to do. As if the North American Free Trade Agreement wasn't bad enough, Congress is working to authorize the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\The media wonders how Donald Trump could be so popular, but look where our leaders have gotten us in the last 20 years. Voters are angry and frustrated with Washington. We have failed as a nation.\My choice for president in November will be Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. He will uphold the U.S. Constitution. He will be a real leader. Republicans and Democrats in Washington are afraid of him because under Cruz, Congress won't get away with a lot of things that it does now.\Bonnie Lane\Sherman"
194,"The recent Associated Press interview ""ExxonMobil CEO: Arctic exploration is worth the risk"" (April 2) is outrageous. What ""softball"" questions! They are setups for oil industry talking points about the virtues of getting oil in the Arctic oceans. \How is it possible to publish an interview on this subject without a word about climate disruption? Does the oil industry ""own"" our major media outlets? Shame on the AP. \The focus is exclusively on oil spills. The potential for catastrophic spills is high. A recent environmental impact study done for the U.S. Department of Interior concludes there is a 75 percent probability of a major oil spill associated with drilling for oil in the Arctic seas. \Whoa! If you knew your behavior translated to a 75 percent chance of getting cancer, you would stop doing what is causing the risk. It is folly to drill for oil in the Arctic oceans. \The biggest issue is climate disruption. Global heating is leading toward unimaginable suffering, both for humans and others. The major cause is burning fossil fuels. \It is imperative to diminish the use of fossil fuels as rapidly as possible, via a combination of voluntary and regulatory actions (including a global carbon tax). The Arctic oceans are the most vulnerable environment on the globe for oil drilling - a place we should never develop. \Eastern North America just experienced a brutal winter. Paradoxically, this is an indicator of climate disruption. It does not indicate that global heating is slowing down. \National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (www.noaa.gov) data from this winter clearly shows that while it was colder than normal in our part of the world, just about everywhere else on the globe was warmer than usual (compared to the last 30-year average). \Let's use our common sense and act responsibly in all we do. Choose life. \Steve Weems Brunswick \We must not tolerate lies from our elected officials \Our leaders in the U.S. House and Senate and the Executive Branch of the federal government now accept lying as normal, acceptable behavior. \During the last few years our politicians have lied so often any observer could fill a book with examples: ""You can keep your doctor""; ""What difference does it now make?""; ""The border is secure""; ""The United States is a racist nation."" I could go on and on. \Recently, a most despicable lie has come to light. Sen. Harry Reid, speaking on the Senate floor, accused Mitt Romney of not paying any taxes. This lie was spoken during the last presidential election. \At the time, Sen. Reid said he had sources and the nonpayment of taxes was a fact. We now know Sen. Reid lied on purpose with malice. \Why do we accept leaders lying to us? Why do our senators, Susan Collins and Angus King, not call out Sen. Reid for this behavior? When we observe Sens. Collins' and King's silence over Sen. Reid's lie about the Romneys, it tells us something about the character of Collins and King. \Unless Sens. Collins and King publicly condemn Reid's lie, they are condoning the lie. \Remember the saying we learned as children, ""Birds of a feather flock together""? When our senators condone a lie stated with malice on the Senate floor, they are then a part of the lies and liars in Washington. Lies from our leaders cannot be tolerated. \God help us. \James Waterhouse Dayton \Sen. King deserves thanks for vote on protected lands \Sen. Angus King deserves thanks for his recent vote on a proposal that could put at risk many of Maine's most cherished protected lands. \He stood up to protect public lands that belong to all of us, such as Maine's 10 national wildlife refuges, like the well-known and loved Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge, and even the White Mountain National Forest - as well as iconic landscapes across the country like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. \On March 26, he voted against an amendment introduced by Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski that could allow for selling off certain federal lands, which could result in special interests developing these lands as well as restricting public access. \Sen. Susan Collins initially voted to block the Murkowski amendment, but at the last minute, she switched her vote, allowing it to pass. I am surprised and disappointed by Sen. Collins' vote because she has been a supporter of protecting lands on which we love to hike, camp and fish. \Sen. King deserves thanks for staying strong on this vote and protecting our natural treasures for future generations. \Nancy L. Gilbert Durham \Cruz event's mandatory attendance provokes thought \In an April 6 letter to the editor (""Ted Cruz has capability to reclaim nation's future""), James Pickett writes of his pleasure that Ted Cruz has decided to enter the presidential race. \Mr. Pickett believes that ""Mr. Cruz can get this country back on course by redefining our liberty, ensuring the equality of natural rights ... ."" \Mr. Pickett goes on to praise Ted Cruz's strategy for making the United States once again ""the strongest and freest country in history."" \What Mr. Pickett neglects to point out is that when Ted Cruz announced his candidacy for president at Liberty University, it was a requirement that all Liberty students attend this event. I would ask Mr. Pickett to clarify: Is this the freedom you and Mr. Cruz speak of? Let freedom ring! \John Gregg Wells \Ballot initiatives should be allowed for all or abolished \I am writing in response to ""Wildlife policies by ballot under fire"" (April 6). \Does Maine really want to become a state where some of its residents are free to get enough signatures to place initiatives on the ballot, but others are prohibited by the state constitution from doing so? \Either we allow all Maine citizens to try to gather enough signatures for a ballot initiative, or we get rid of the ballot initiative process. Any legislator who feels otherwise should be ashamed of themselves for trying to prevent some of us from using it simply because they do not agree with the topic. \Maggie Dumais Topsham"
195,"More and more people are recognizing the reality of effects on the environment by looking at the data right before their eyes, writes Dana Wilde.\A few weeks back this column offered nowhere near the first observation that Australia’s enormous wildfires are a wake-up call about climate change. About how bad it might get if we don’t do anything. Some people, of course, are sleeping through the alarm.\I want to do the opposite of discourage you, this week. But first you need to read an email message I received in response to that column about Australia. This is the whole message, exactly as written:\“Here’s a wake up call to you. The only reason for the term ‘climate change’ is because you crack pots couldn’t prove there was any validity behind ‘global warming.’ Climate change is natural. Mankind CANNOT kill the planet. Even the Exxon Valdez oil spill was absorbed by the ocean with NO lasting side effects. President Trump is right and you’d do well to listen to Consevative talk radio. It will lift the illusion.”\I have to tell you, the more I thought about this, the more I thought it might not be a central Maine news reader at all, but maybe a Russian troll spreading a little more fiction to enhance the nausea we all seem to be suffering. Hard to tell. I replied by sending a NOAA temperature graph and inviting any reply that did not simply spit back venom. No response.\One reason I think it’s possible the email came from a troll is that it seems, to me at least, like the tide has pretty much turned on climate change denial. I know Rush Limbaugh and the oil industry’s shills keep pushing, well, alternative facts (that are simply false — unless the quarter-million birds that died in the Valdez disaster do not count as a lasting side-effect), but I think fewer and fewer people are believing them.\In other words, more and more people are recognizing the reality right before their eyes. Even U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, whose moral instrumentation apparently got lost on or about Jan. 20, 2017, has joined the Senate’s Climate Solutions Caucus. Whether this is simply a gesture to gain back a few of the voters whom she’s also misplaced, or a genuine interest in the phenomena, none of us here in the peanut gallery really knows.\But either way, it’s still one hopeful sign among quite a few, actually, that a preponderance of us is awakening to (applying a phrase from 1990s science fiction to 2020s reality) fight the future.\It can be done:\• During the coronavirus outbreak that happened to coincide with the roughly three-week New Year holiday in China, oil refineries, steel production, airplane flights and other emission-producing activities were so drastically reduced compared to recent years that China alone has reduced global greenhouse emissions for 2020 by 100 million tons compared to what it would have been without the coronavirus. If it can be done by accident, IT CAN BE DONE deliberately.\• Bill McKibben, in chapter 20 of his book “Falter,” explains how solar energy is poised to play a major role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The technology is basically ready to go. If tiny villages in Africa can set up solar-powered electricity, so can bigger places: South Portland has a 34-acre municipal solar farm. “Every major nation on Earth,” McKibben says, “could be supplying 80% of its power from renewables (e.g., solar and wind) by 2030, at prices far cheaper than paying for the damage from climate change.”\• IT CAN BE DONE: In June, Gov. Janet Mills signed the bipartisan LD 1711 bill into law, “to promote solar energy projects” in Maine.\• In response to the danger from rising sea level, some Maine communities, such as Damariscotta, Bath, Vinalhaven and Portland, are spending money to study ways of dealing with it. Damariscotta’s town manager told a Working Waterfront reporter that private donors have helped supplement scarce grant money to fund the studies. IT CAN BE DONE.\• The Citizens Climate Lobby, which has a chapter in Waterville, is one of the groups working for climate change legislation that includes a completely economically feasible and effective carbon tax plan. The basic idea, which is so obvious it hurts, is that warding off catastrophic climate change is a collective effort that has to involve individuals, businesses and governments together. IT CAN BE DONE.\• The U.S. Senate has a climate solutions club. Whether they are serious remains to be seen.\• And throwing yet more head-scratching irony at us, President Trump announced last month that the U.S. supports the One Trillion Trees Initiative, which proposes the world start planting trees to help offset carbon emissions. Planting trees is not a panacea, but it could be a major factor in mitigating the mess that’s coming. I wonder what the email writer quoted above thinks about this. The truth is out there.\In case you’re already feeling complacent:\• Read the first 19 chapters of McKibben’s book.\• Trump’s 2020 budget proposal calls for a 26% reduction in EPA funding and the elimination of 50 of its programs.\• Last month the EPA stripped regulations from the 2015 Clean Water Rule to allow landowners and property developers to dump pesticides and fertilizers directly into waterways and destroy wetlands for construction projects. I wonder what the new member of the Senate Climate Solutions Caucus thinks about this.\• The EPA’s Science Advisory Board, which includes many members appointed by Trump, posted letters stating there is “no scientific justification” for the changes to the Clean Water Rule.\• The average global land and surface temperature was the highest ever recorded for January — more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average for the month, according to NOAA.\• The four warmest Januaries on record have occurred since 2016.\• Snow cover during January was 190,000 square miles smaller than the 1981-2010 average for the Northern Hemisphere, according to the Rutgers Global Snow Lab.\• Arctic sea ice extent for January 2020 was tied with 2014 for the eighth-lowest extent in the satellite record for January, according to the National Snow & Ice Data Center. The record low for January was in 2018.\• This month is going to end as one of the top five warmest Februaries recorded in Maine.\I guess if it helps you sleep, you can believe a story in which tens of thousands of climate scientists for about 60 years have been fictionalizing facts like these. “These aren’t the droids you’re looking for,” the voices of “Consevative talk radio” keep reassuring you. “Mankind cannot kill the planet.”\However, reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away, as science fiction’s prophet of postmodern insanity observed in the 1960s. Eventually the fires, floods, erosion, droughts, killer heat waves, category 4 and 5 hurricanes and refugees that are already punishing Australia, Syria, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, Central America, Houston, California will start showing up in our backyards too.

196,"While our trade war with China has recently inspired a deluge of headlines outlining the Chinese Communist Party's anti-competitive trade and economic policies, another perverse tactic of theirs has gone relatively unnoticed in the published annals of American media. Last week, the U.S. Senate published a damning report on attempts by China to infiltrate American institutions of education through the innocuously titled Confucius Institute.\The report describes, with great alarm, the extent this government-sponsored organization goes to promote misguided perspectives on China's geopolitical systems on American high school and college campuses.\Spending over $158 million on these centers since 2004, the report points out that China is using this silent arm of state to set the agenda on China discourse at schools in the U.S., vetoing speakers and topics that do not align with the goals of the Chinese government, thus chilling debate on issues of paramount importance as we reflect on China's increasingly hostile role in the world.\In a particularly ironic twist, the Chinese government has prevented the U.S. government from setting up American cultural centers in China.\Of note to Maine is the University of Southern Maine's chapter of the Confucius Institute, which is not only active under the leadership of professor Joseph McDonnell, but recently opened a new facility to house this organization on its Portland campus.\It is incumbent upon USM leadership, notably President Glenn Cummings, and others in the University of Maine System to determine if they wish to be affiliated with an organization that not only strikes at the worthy promise of academic freedom inherent in our public universities, but also threatens to undermine the greater experiment in freedom of speech that forms the foundation of our country.\Eamonn Dundon \Portland\Carbon fee and dividend should be federal policy\Thank you for your article regarding Gov. Mills' climate agenda announcement (""Mills sets goal to fight climate change: 100% renewable electricity by 2050,"" Feb. 28).\Potential policies mentioned in the article, such as a proposed state carbon tax, can seem frightening, but it is the impact of unmitigated climate change on Maine farmers, fishermen and families that is truly scary. Carbon pricing, a policy endorsed by scientists and economists, is an effective way to reduce dangerous greenhouse-gas production.\Carbon pricing does not need to work through a tax, however. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act of 2019, now in the U.S. House of Representatives, would apply a carbon fee at the source of production, then distribute this money directly back to all Americans in the form of a monthly dividend check. Farmers and fishermen, as well as the military, are exempt from the fee.\Studies show that the money received by low-income families would outweigh the additional cost at the pump. The bill adds no money to government coffers and acts as a clear signal to businesses to innovate toward a greener future, which is why it has significant bipartisan support. Several thousand regular Mainers are registered right now with the bipartisan Citizens' Climate Lobby, which is asking Gov. Mills, as well as Reps. Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden, to support this bill. We hope your readers will join us!\Nina Trowbridge\member, Citizens' Climate Lobby \Cape Elizabeth\Inspections jack up cost of owning motor vehicle\I agree with Bill Capistran on the ripoff vehicle inspection we endure here in Maine (Another View, March 4). I have yet to have a bill for less than $100 for the repairs to pass inspection.\My last inspection was nothing less than fraud. I drive a 2005 F-150. All I needed was to have the driver's side window switch fixed and a tailpipe. It cost me over $2,000. They removed my new mufflers and replaced them with cheap junk.\I got no relief from the state of Maine, which I thought protected its citizens from predators.\John Sell\Gray\Concert showcases creativity, diversity\I'd like to comment on the Feb. 18 article about Gov. Mills ""looking ahead"" from the ""turbulence"" of the previous administration (Page B1). But first:\As a crew member at The Center for Maine Crafts in West Gardiner, we attended Creative Portland's ""Hear Here"" program Feb. 17 at the Merrill Auditorium. It's only a few blocks from Trader Joe's, so we were doubly excited to saddle up and ride down. I was particularly impressed by the Batimbo United Burundi drummers' visual, as well as thundering audio performance.\We were surprised (but then again we weren't) when Mayor Ethan Strimling introduced Rep. Chellie Pingree and Gov. Mills. Casually dressed, the governor mentioned that she'd just come off the ice from a day of fishing to make the trip down to Portland to support the creative arts. Frankly, I'd bag ice fishing to light a votive candle. But you get the idea - she genuinely cares. I'll bet she loves Trader Joe's, too.\All three leaders, in their own words, stressed diversity and acceptance as fundamental, celebratory virtues that have historically defined our country and certainly the city of Portland - as evidenced by this ebullient program. It was not lost on me that today, tumultuous ""turbulence"" and the weeping and wailing over that dopey ""wall"" seek to divide us, and have succeeded in doing so. But our state survived - so will our country.\Conversely (and euphorically!) Maine's thriving creative community and promising leadership were both on full display - and vividly united - in music, song, dance and word at the Merrill Auditorium.\Our new administration has been called ""a breath of fresh air."" So open a window. Take a deep breath. Refreshing, ain't it?\Buddy Doyle\Gardiner\CMP's money sways Gov. Mills into supporting CMP project\Gov. Mills has recently come out in support of Central Maine Power's New England Clean Energy Connect project. These are my concerns:\One, during the campaign, Janet Mills stated, ""Until CMP demonstrates that their transmission line proposal offers concrete and long-term benefits to the people of Maine, rather than just to Quebec and Massachusetts, I have very serious questions about the proposal."" Mills flipped on the issue after a backroom meeting with CMP. CMP has not demonstrated any long-term benefits to Mainers. CMP has increased the temporary hush money, and that is the only difference.\Two, Gov. Mills states that ""we cannot afford to do nothing"" in regard to our carbon emissions. Hydro-Quebec is already up and running. There is no new power en route. They are already selling their power to New York. Massachusetts is offering to buy their power for a higher rate, increasing CMP's profit margin. There will be no global net decrease in carbon emissions; there will actually be an increase once 2,000 acres of Maine have been clear-cut.\Three, Vermont has all the permits lined up and is ready to go for this project. CMP and Gov. Mills want to run it through Maine because Vermont will require them to bury the cable. Clear-cutting 2000 acres of continuous forest, ruining native brook trout habitat, destroying deer wintering areas and constructing 100-foot towers through some of the most scenic areas of Maine is cheaper.\I could go on but am limited to 300 words.\Don't believe CMP or Gov. Mills. This is not about the environment - this is all about profit. They want to destroy our natural resources because it is the cheaper option.\Joseph Cousins \Glenburn"

198,"WASHINGTON -- Along with roll call votes last week, the Senate also passed the Federal Law Enforcement Self-Defense and Protection Act (H.R. 2137), to ensure federal law enforcement officers can ensure their own safety, and the safety of their families, during a covered furlough; passed the Indian Trust Asset Reform Act (H.R. 812), to reform management of Indian trust assets; passed a resolution (S. Res. 496), condemning the terrorist attack on the Pulse Orlando nightclub; and passed the Rapid DNA Act (S. 2348), to implement the use of Rapid DNA instruments in the judiciary system. \The House also passed the FOIA Improvement Act (S. 337), to improve the Freedom of Information Act; passed the Oversee Visa Integrity with Stakeholder Advisories Act (H.R. 3636), to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow labor organizations and management organizations to receive the results of visa petitions about which such organizations have submitted advisory opinions; passed the Strategy To Oppose Predatory Organ Trafficking Act (H.R. 3694), to combat trafficking in human organs; and passed a resolution (H. Res. 343), expressing concern regarding persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in China. \HOUSE VOTES \House Vote 1 \CUTTING LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SPENDING: The House has rejected an amendment sponsored by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., to the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (H.R. 5325). The amendment would have cut spending for programs covered by the bill by 1 percent, other than keeping funding flat for Capitol security accounts. Blackburn said the cut would put the federal government on a better track toward less spending and increased fiscal responsibility. An amendment opponent, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., said it ""would do nothing more than hurt the service we are able to provide to our constituents"" by cutting resources available for Congress to legislate wisely. The vote, on June 10, was 165 yeas to 237 nays. \NAYS: Chellie Pingree, D-1st District \YEAS: Bruce Poliquin, R-2nd District \House Vote 2 \LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SPENDING: The House has passed the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (H.R. 5325), sponsored by Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga. The bill would provide $3.481 billion of funding for fiscal 2017 programs in the federal government's legislative branch, including the Capitol building, but not including the Senate. Graves said it curbed wasteful spending by making tough budgetary choices while continuing to ""preserve the beauty, enhance the security, and improve the institutions of the United States Capitol complex."" A bill opponent, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., questioned its $32.5 million increase in funding for the Capitol's police force and said its $107.9 million to fund the Congressional Research Service was insufficient. The vote, on June 10, was 233 yeas to 175 nays. \NAYS: Pingree \YEAS: Poliquin \House Vote 3 \CARBON TAX: The House has passed a resolution (H. Con. Res. 89), sponsored by Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., expressing the sense of Congress that a tax on carbon dioxide emissions would harm the U.S. economy. Scalise said the tax would have no impact on global CO2 levels while costing more than a million U.S. jobs and increasing costs for consumers, especially low-income people. A resolution opponent, Rep. Sander M.

Boustany Jr., R-La., expressing the sense of Congress in opposition to President Obama's proposed $10 per barrel excise tax on crude oil production in the U.S. Boustany said the tax ""would not only add significantly to the cost of a gallon of gasoline at the pump, certainly disproportionately hurting fixed-income families, seniors, and so forth, it would also have a detrimental impact on job creation, on wages, and on the Nation's overall economic health."" A resolution opponent, Rep. Sander M. Levin, D-Mich., said it was based on a Republican denial of climate change and the role of oil and other fossil fuels in causing global warming, and blocking the tax would impair the country's ability to combat the climate change threat. The vote, on June 10, was 253 yeas to 144 nays. \NAYS: Pingree \YEAS: Poliquin \House Vote 5 \RELATIONS WITH CARIBBEAN NATIONS: The House has passed the United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act (H.R. 4939), sponsored by Rep. Eliot L. Engel, D-N.Y. The bill would require a State Department report to Congress outlining a strategy for U.S. policy toward Caribbean nations, including improving the region's public safety and its economy. Engel said the bill would improve U.S. diplomatic and economic engagement with the strategically important Caribbean by adopting new policies. The vote, on June 13, was 386 yeas to 6 nays. \YEAS: Pingree, Poliquin \House Vote 6 \GOVERNMENT NETWORKING AND IT RESEARCH: The House has passed the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act (H.R. 5312), sponsored by Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Ill. The bill would rename the National High-Performance Computing Program as the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program, and charge the renamed program with researching cybersecurity, human-computer interactions, big data, and the use of data analytics to integrate city-scale information technology and physical infrastructures. LaHood said information technology developed by the program ""bolsters economic competitiveness and creates new industries and businesses; it helps ensure future national security, including cybersecurity; and creates the good-paying jobs we need for today and tomorrow.""

Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga. The bill would change the role of the Large Facilities Office at the National Science Foundation, with the goal of improving the NSF's management of large research buildings. Loudermilk said reforming the Office to improve oversight of facility construction and management of the NSF should reduce waste and time and cost overruns at the agency. The vote, on June 14, was 412 yeas to 9 nays. \YEAS: Pingree, Poliquin \House Vote 8 \TAX-EXEMPT GROUPS AND THE IRS: The House has passed the Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act (H.R. 5053), sponsored by Rep. Peter J. Roskam, R-Ill. The bill would bar the Internal Revenue Service from requiring tax-exempt organizations to provide information identifying their contributors in their annual tax returns. Roskam said the IRS has stated that it does not need to identify contributors in order to review filings by the organizations, and that the IRS has shown a tendency to illegitimately leak contributor information with resulting harassment of the contributors by hostile groups. A bill opponent, Rep. Sander M. Levin, D-Mich., said keeping contributor information from the IRS ""removes the last safeguard against foreign governments and foreign individuals from influencing our elections."" The vote, on June 14, was 240 yeas to 182 nays. \NAYS: Pingree \YEAS: Poliquin \House Vote 9 \MILITARY CLIMATE CHANGE DIRECTIVE: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293). The amendment would bar funding for implementation of the Defense Department's directive on climate change adaptation and resilience. Buck said the directive, by forcing military officials to prioritize climate change over measures to combat U.S. enemies, would distract the military from its ultimate purpose of protecting national security. An amendment opponent, Rep. Peter J. Visclosky, D-Ind., said it would hamstring the military's capacity to account for problems created by climate change and a changing global environment. The vote, on June 16, was 216 yeas to 205 nays. \NAYS: Pingree \YEAS: Poliquin \House Vote 10 \MILITARY BASES AND ALIEN CHILDREN: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Ala., to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293). The amendment would bar funding for building facilities on military bases to provide temporary housing for unaccompanied alien children. Byrne said ""it simply makes no sense for these individuals to be held at military installations"" that often lack basic infrastructure such as sewage facilities or are near live artillery ranges and active airfields. An amendment opponent, Rep. Peter J. Visclosky, D-Ind., said the military should be allowed to use domestic bases ""to provide the same type of humanitarian assistance to minor children that we do in the Philippines, Pakistan, Japan, Bangladesh, and Haiti."" The vote, on June 16, was 223 yeas to 198 nays. \NAYS: Pingree \YEAS: Poliquin \House Vote 11 \DETAINING ENEMY COMBATANTS DOMESTICALLY: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293). The amendment would bar funding for surveying and other initiatives related to the potential use of locations within the U.S. to detain enemy combatants now held at the Guantanamo Bay facility in Cuba. Lamborn said ""it is against the law for the terrorists held at Guantanamo to be brought to the United States,"" so Congress should provide no funding toward that purpose. An amendment opponent, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said replacing Guantanamo Bay would save many millions of dollars while improving national security by removing a propaganda tool for terrorist groups. The vote, on June 16, was 245 yeas to 175 nays. \NAYS: Pingree \YEAS: Poliquin \House Vote 12 \WARRANTLESS DATABASE SEARCHES: The House has rejected an amendment sponsored by Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293). The amendment would have barred funding for the federal government to use a foreign intelligence database to conduct searches for information about U.S. citizens. Massie said the ban would maintain the Fourth Amendment protection against warrantless searches of Americans, without hampering the ability of intelligence agencies to detect external threats to the country. An amendment opponent, Rep. Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., said the ban, by impeding the government's ability to locate information about threats, ""would put a lot more American lives at risk both at home and abroad."" The vote, on June 16, was 198 yeas to 222 nays. \YEAS: Pingree \NAYS: Poliquin \House Vote 13 \GREEN ENERGY AND THE MILITARY: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293). The amendment would bar funding for Defense Department efforts to meet various green energy mandates set out in law and by the president. McClintock said the mandates ""require the military to squander billions of dollars on so-called green energy"" that is expensive and wasteful of scarce military resources. An amendment opponent, Rep. Peter J. Visclosky, D-Ind., said it would block a wide range of sensible military initiatives, including portable solar power for soldiers in combat. The vote, on June 16, was 221 yeas to 197 nays. \NAYS: Pingree \YEAS: Poliquin \House Vote 14 \AFGHANISTAN INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293). The amendment would bar funding for projects under the military's Afghanistan infrastructure fund. Walberg said the infrastructure fund was poorly run, wasteful, and lacked adequate oversight, and needed no further funding from Congress. An amendment opponent, Rep. Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., said the ban would leave many large electric power projects in Afghanistan unfinished, disrupting efforts to provide basic necessary infrastructure to the nation and improve its security. The vote, on June 16, was 218 yeas to 201 nays. \YEAS: Pingree, Poliquin \House Vote 15 \MILITARY SPENDING IN 2017: The House has passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293), sponsored by Rep. Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, R-N.J. The bill would fund $575.8 billion of fiscal 2017 military spending by the Defense Department, including $58.6 billion for combat operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other overseas countries. Frelinghuysen said it ""wisely invests more money for our troops, more training for our troops, more modern equipment, expanded cybersecurity, more intelligence-gathering capabilities, and better healthcare outcomes for our troops and their families."" A bill opponent, Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, faulted it for failing to provide funding after April of 2017, saying that it ""recklessly endangers our servicemembers by severely restricting the financial stability, certainty, and budgeting predictability that commanders need to plan beyond next April."" The vote, on June 16, was 282 yeas to 138 nays. \YEAS: Pingree, Poliquin \House Vote 16 \CAMPAIGNS TO COUNTER TERRORISM: The House has passed the Countering Terrorist Radicalization Act (H.R. 5471), sponsored by Rep. Michael T. McCaul, R-Texas. The bill would authorize initiatives at the Homeland Security Department to counter violent extremism through public education, intelligence, and other measures. McCaul said that increasing the use of testimonials from former members of the Islamic State group (ISIS) was among the measures the bill advanced ""to help communities spot signs of violent radicalization and to actively combat the propaganda of terrorist groups like ISIS."" The vote, on June 16, was 402 yeas to 15 nays. \YEAS: Pingree, Poliquin \SENATE VOTES \Senate Vote 1 \MILITARY SPENDING AUTHORIZATION: The Senate has passed the National Defense Authorization Act (S. 2943), sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. The bill would authorize $603.9 billion of fiscal 2017 spending on the military, military construction programs, and the Energy Department's military programs, and set out personnel levels for the various branches of the military. McCain said it would reform the military and give it a greater capability to fight radical terrorist Islam both domestically and overseas. A bill opponent, Sen. Kirsten E. Gillibrand, D-N.Y., criticized it for insufficient measures to address rape and other sexual crimes within the military. The vote, on June 14, was 85 yeas to 13 nays. \YEAS: Susan Collins R-Maine; Angus King, I-Maine \Senate Vote 2 \FUNDING COUNTER-OPIOID MEASURES: The Senate has agreed to a motion sponsored by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, R-N.H., to instruct conferees with the House on negotiating the two chambers' versions of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (S. 524). The motion insisted that the bill's conference report include provisions funding prevention, treatment, and recovery programs by state and local governments to combat heroin and opioid abuse. Shaheen said ""the opioid crisis is a national public health emergency, and it is long past time that Congress treat it like one"" by adequately funding anti-opioid measures. The vote, on June 16, was 66 yeas to 29 nays. \YEAS: Collins, King \Senate Vote 3 \NEGOTIATING VERSIONS OF OPIOID ABUSE BILL: The Senate has agreed to a motion sponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., to instruct conferees with the House on negotiating the two chambers' versions of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (S. 524). The motion insisted that the bill's conference report establish a single grant program for efforts related to opioid abuse and that it address the unique concerns of rural areas impacted by opioid abuse, among other provisions. Whitehouse said the measures sought to improve the bill and ""focus on the rural communities for which opioid has been a plague.""

Lacking national standards, gains from alternative energy elude us
\
Energy prices and conflict in the Middle East, combined with growing concern global warming, have jumpstarted an overdue national conversation about United States energy policy. The public is clamoring for solutions and, in this generation, support has never been deeper for increasing the amount of power we get from renewable energy.
\
The United States is the most technologically and economically advanced nation in the world, blessed with vast natural and intellectual resources and a skilled workforce - Maine fits this ideal. Our nation has a record of responding to challenges and achieving unthinkable goals. If any nation in the world is capable of creating an energy system to fuel our economy, while preserving our environment and our security, it is America.
\
But, right now, America is failing to realize its almost unlimited potential to generate electricity from sources like wind and solar energy. Just last year, Maine set a goal of increasing its clean energy production 10 percent by 2017, above the renewable power it already generates.
\
Now is time for the country to move together on a new energy future.
\
The United States has historically been a leader in deployment of renewable energy technologies. As recently as the mid-1990s, the United States led the world in solar power capacity, and was second in wind. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. By 2004, Japan had three times the American photovoltaic capacity; Germany had more than double. The United States is now third in installed wind power capacity, behind Germany and Spain.
\
Germany employs more than 40,000 workers in its wind energy industry, and Denmark another 20,000. Both countries have wind resources only a fraction of those in America's windiest states.
\
In Germany, the wind energy industry is the second-largest consumer of steel next to the automotive industry.
\
Fortunately, an expanding number of communities are pressing the nation toward cleaner, renewable energy. State and local officials are increasingly seeing the economic development benefits of renewable energy in Maine, and elswhere in the country. Farmers, foresters and ranchers recognize the benefits renewable energy provides for agricultural interests and rural economies.
\
And, workers and businesses are beginning to understand renewable energy technologies have the potential to create high quality jobs to drive our nation into the 21st century.
\
Already 22 states - from Texas in the South, to Minnesota in the North, to Maine in the Northeast, Arizona in the Southwest and Washington State in the Northwest - have passed renewable energy standards, committing nearly half of our country's population to renewable energy targets as high as 25 percent by 2020.
\
By creating guaranteed markets for renewable energy, these policies have helped jumpstart new statewide energy economies. Evidence of the economic benefits is already apparent.
\
For example, Pennsylvania's clean energy standard has spurred investment by Gamesa, a large Spanish wind turbine manufacturer, into four plants outside Philadelphia to assemble wind energy equipment for use in the United States. One thousand Americans will return to work at a former U.S. Steel mill outside of Fairless, Pa. This is one of many examples of the investment boom in clean energy jobs spreading across the country.
\
Developing our renewable energy resources will create jobs, save consumers money and bolster rural economies. A 2004 study by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) found a national standard requiring 20 percent of electric generation from renewable energy by 2020 would save consumers tens of billions annually in electricity and natural gas bills, and create several hundred thousand new jobs.
\
In addition, by shifting away from fossil fuels, the United States can diversify and secure its energy supply while reducing global warming. A recent analysis based on assumptions by the Energy Information Administration indicates the same national standard would cut global warming pollution by 263 million metric tons by 2030 - the equivalent of taking 43 million cars off the road.
\
Building on the states momentum, it is time for Congress to act on a renewable energy standard.
\
Rep. Tom Udall, D-N.M., and Todd Platts, R-Pa., have introduced a national standard of 20 percent renewable energy by 2020.
\
We congratulate Maine's Rep. Tom Allen and Rep. Mike Michaud for co-sponsoring this legislation to help build a cleaner and more secure economy for America, while reducing global warming and again making the United States the world's clean-energy leader.Matthew Davis is organizational development director for Environment Maine. Bruce Roy of Jay is president of the Maine Labor Council of the United Steelworkers.

200,"It is easy to misread the chronic controversy over electric utility regulation in Maine. What appear to be symptoms of strain and weakness in the system instead reflect its historic aggressiveness and confidence to experiment. Both will be tested severely in 1995 as utilities ask for greater freedom and the state adjusts to dramatic changes in the energy marketplace.\Maine's two largest electric utilities, Central Maine Power Co. and Bangor Hydro-Electric Co., have entered a transition of unprecedented magnitude. Each went in financially strapped, encumbered by purchased power contracts imposed by state policy, and limited in their capacity to respond to competition.\To emerge financially secure and successful -- a transformation that would benefit the state's homeowners and its business environment -- CMP and Hydro need continued support from the Maine Public Utilities Commission to use their judgment, creativity and expertise to develop new markets and expand their revenue base.\CMP recently concluded more than a year of negotiations with its major industrial customers, the public advocate and interest groups and has PUC approval for an alternative-rate plan. The ARP sets a lower limit for CMP prices, with tests that must be met before they can be decreased. But the public focus has been on the ARP's roof. Rates have been capped for five years, adjustable upward at 3 percent annually. This offers long-term rate stability to CMP's unusually large class of big consumers. CMP, meanwhile, can maneuver prices under the roof.\Hydro, functioning in a market very different from CMP's, has offered the commission a more ambitious plan that makes some regulatory veterans uneasy. Hydro says it will freeze rates at their current level for five years, but wants a low floor for its prices. Its objective: a pricing flexibility plan targeted at three classes of customers. If successful, it will increase the total volume of sales by marketing power at rates close to marginal costs (the price of added units of electric energy).\One of the ironies in the electric energy marketplace is that while Maine homeowners and businesses are burdened with electricity that costs around 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, new electricity is available at below 3 cents per kwh. If Hydro can respond quickly in its market, pricing its product to compete with propane and oil for water heaters or the new generation of heating systems, everyone could win. As the company wrote in its brief to the commission:\""To the extent that the company can sell electricity at prices above its marginal cost that it could not otherwise sell at higher prices, all customers are able to benefit by the spreading of the company's fixed costs over a larger rate base.""\Opponents in the regulatory community, fearful that the Hydro will cut prices too low and be locked into contracts that are imprudent, want delays in the company's ability to adjust to its market, continued emphasis on expensive formal proceedings, and a higher floor on its prices. The latter provides a bureaucratic comfort zone that is inherently arbitrary and ignores points that the commission should consider:\The commission should insist upon a demanding schedule of reporting on the Hydro's flexible rate plan. The utility will be under constant scrutiny in the marketplace. The PUC can step back in at any time. Hydro's stockholders and management must accept the financial consequences for imprudence.\Although a reluctant latecomer to demand-side management, the company has built a solid record of follow-through on PUC orders. In addition, its warnings that some of the previous commissions' policies would prove expensive and counterproductive proved to be accurate. Although its corporate statements sometimes harken back to the utility cold wars of 1970s and 1980s, the record shows it has learned from its mistakes.\In April, the commission asked utilities to submit alternative marketing plans. The companies delivered creative proposals that anticipate an energy market with unprecedented competition. Power companies continue to need state oversight, but they no longer hold a monopoly on electric energy. There is a growing list of generation and energy options for customers, especially the largest consumers of power. Deregulation of the industry nationally will bring a more freewheeling energy market to Maine. Within generous limits, it's time to untie the hands of utilities. Give them the opportunity to succeed.\In the past, the Public Utilities Commission has not been reluctant to move Maine to the forefront as a national leader, and push utility regulation out, onto the edge. This is no time to back away."
201,"The present financial difficulties of Bangor Hydro-Electric Co. are the result of five events over which they had little control: 1) the failure of the Seabrook plant to live up to expectations, 2) the collapse of the oil price, 3) the cost of conservation programs, 4) the investment in the wood-burning plants and other ""NUGs,"" and 5) the premature closing of Maine Yankee.\During the last 197s and leary '80s nuclear power was a real winner for the consumer. Maine Yankee was designed to be competitive with oil-generated electricity when industrial oil was 15 cents a gallon. When oil went to 77 cents a gallon in 1981, Maine Yankee saved customers more than $200 million n just one year. No wonder Seabrook looked good. But high interest charges on construction loans, long dealys resulting from changes needed in the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident forced the projecte cost of Seabrook electricity to increase above the cost of projected alternatives. Bangor Hydro sold its ownership shares at a significant loss. At this point, Hydro signed contracts for electric energy at costs reflecting the Seatbrook experience and the projected cost of oil.\To the great surprise of everyone, the price of oil collapsed. In 1988 the price fell to 33 cents a gallon. Hydro customers, home homeownes to industries, could fall back on cheap oil while Hydro wa stuck with the high-cost contracts.\Demand-side management programs were appropriate when the next kilowatt-hour was more expensive than the average kilowatt-hour. But as increased capacity became availble this situation reversed and conservation programs increased the cost of electricity.\There is no ""rainy day fund"" to project Hydro from the costs of the premature closing of Maine Yankee. This hurts two ways: They must buy the lost electricity and make up for the decomissioning costs not covered by the sinking fund already established. In a deregulated environment Maine Yankee could be priced ""at the market."" During the past two or three decades, the difference between Maine Yankee costs and the cost of alternatives would have generated a kitty of several hundred millions dollars, and there would be no current crisis at Bangor Hydro.\I have been a close observer of the Maine energy scene for 50 years. No one saw this coming. In the early 1980s there were no letters to the editor saying, ""The price of oil will collapse -- don't invest in high-cost alternatives."" The investment in renewable sources of energy production seemed like a good idea to everyone.\The present dilemma of Hydro is driven by the whipsaw of events over which they had little control.\Richard C. Hill is professor emeritus of mechanical engineering at the University of Maine."
202,"What do you do when your company has developed a bill-collecting system that others envy, a service that could generate added revenue?\Put it on the market.\Find out if anyone will buy it.\Unless you're a publicly regulated utility.\In that case you have to ask permission to learn if it will sell. That's how the regulated environment works in Maine.\Central Maine Power Co. (CMP) has developed the better mousetrap for snaring and clearing out old debts. With 500,000 subscribers, the company gains new experience every month collecting unpaid bills from residential, commercial and industrial customers. It thinks it's good at it. Businesses tell it so.\Maine's largest distributor of electricity wants to take a step that is becoming increasingly common for regulated utilities: set up a subsidiary company, in this case a collection agency. Use CMP's small collections staff, for now. Go out and hustle new business. Develop a base of state and national customers. Add more employees later, as workload demands.\The pace of establishing subsidiary operations is picking up. It's understandable. Regulated utilities have learned to do some things very well. It only makes sense that they be allowed to profit from experience and expertise. Debt collection is something CMP does deftly. In part because as a regulated monopoly it has operated under constraints. It has had to be compassionate -- the Public Utilities Commission over the years regulated how forcefully it could come down on customers in arrears -- and it has learned how to be effective in tracking down subscribers who owed it money. It built systems and developed software that have application to other businesses with back-due accounts.\The utility has other services that are naturals for separate development. Energy efficiency programs, once state ordered to promote demand-side management, are a service that can be sold to businesses, and exported. CMP already is doing this in Armenia and Bulgaria -- part of a rich market because of the amount of wasted electrical energy in the state-run economies of Eastern Europe. Dig Safe and related programs that can identify the location and condition of utility service lines can be contracted out to clients. With telecommunications industries booming, it is a potentially lucrative market.\Among the best advice from analysts to electric utilities: identify your company's core competencies, de-integrate and spin off functions, capabilities and even assets.\Utility departments which successfully exploit their potential to sell services on the outside will benefit their companies and ratepayers in two ways.\Competition will make them better at what they do. They will provide improved services more cheaply to the utility's core customers.\Revenue from sales will make the parent company more secure and profitable, reducing pressure to increase rates.\Central Maine Power's corporate energy increasingly will be put into creating subsidiary operations. The utility is picking up the pace, and state regulators, in their role as overseers of a far less restrictive, more competitive marketplace, should be willing to match it, step for step."

Higgins said the resolution was needed given recent calls to abolish ICE despite the agency's successful apprehension of more than 127,000 criminal aliens on homicide and other violent charges in 2017 alone, and the resulting need to formally state congressional support for ICE workers and their mission.

208,"Legislators in Augusta agree that Maine needs to put more money into its roads and bridges.\They recognize that thousands of miles of Maine highways are crumbling, requiring the state to close 3,380 kilometers (2,100 miles) of roads each spring to truck traffic. They know, too, that much of this work needs to be done in poorer rural areas and that those areas depend on a good transportation network.\Wanting to fix up the roads, however, is the easy part for lawmakers. Where it gets tough is in deciding how to pay for this work.\Gov. King has made a sensible proposal to increase the state's 19- cent-per-gallon gas tax by 5 cents. Doing so would generate $33 million annually, plugging a hole in the state's highway fund.\Not only is the gas tax hike needed, but it is good public policy. A higher tax on gas will encourage fuel efficiency, which in turn will benefit the environment. It's also a fair way to raise money for road repairs. The tax is paid by the users of the state's roadways.\Its primary drawback is that a higher gas tax will have a somewhat greater impact on poorer people in rural areas. Still, the impact will be small, while the benefit of well-maintained roads will be significant in rural Maine. Reducing the state's sales tax from 5.5 percent to 5 percent as the governor has proposed, meanwhile, will provide some offsetting tax relief that will be of particular benefit to the state's poorest citizens.\Other ideas for funding highway repairs include dedicating a portion of the taxes collected on vehicle sales to road repair. This is a volatile source of revenue, however, while the need to fix roads is constant. The same is true for other general-fund revenue sources.\The gas tax is the best way to raise this money.

AUGUSTA -- Lawmakers on Thursday discussed a proposal to raise the fuel tax by 11 cents per gallon over the next four years as a way to boost plummeting revenue and maintain state roads.
\
The proposal also would eliminate the current indexing of the tax to inflation, which critics have complained puts fuel-tax increases on ""automatic pilot.""
\
Currently, the Maine tax on gasoline is 29.5 cents per gallon, and 30.7 cents for diesel. The proposal, heard Thursday in the Transportation Committee, would equalize the two taxes, adding a bit more per gallon of gas to get the two on par.
\
The idea came from a bipartisan subcommittee of the Transportation Committee that included members of the trucking and construction industries.
\
The increases would be phased in: 3.5 cents the first year, 3.5 cents the second, 2 cents the third and 2 cents the fourth. They would raise an estimated $56.7 million in the first two-year period, and $125.6 million in the second two-year period.
\
The proposal came as the committee discussed efforts to close budget gaps in the current fiscal year and in the next two-year budget period, which starts July 1. Sen. Dennis Damon, D-Trenton, co-chair of the committee, called the proposal a ""critical component"" of the next biennium's highway budget.
\
Damon and his co-chair, Rep. Edward Mazurek, D-Rockland, said that the funding mechanism for the highway fund hasn't worked, and that the state hasn't been able to perform adequate maintenance on its roads and bridges. Increasing the fuel tax by linking it to inflation has failed, said Damon, because construction cost increases have far outpaced the rate.
\
Ultimately, said Mazurek, a lack of maintenance leads to ""roads becoming gravel."" ""This is an attempt to at least put a halt to that,"" he said.
\
The highway budget is separate from the general fund, but both have been under tremendous pressure due to the poor economy. State revenue forecasters estimated at the beginning of this month that the highway fund would fall short of budget by $16.7 million this fiscal year, which ends July 1. There would be a $42.3 million budget gap in the highway fund in the next two-year period.
\
Through March, about $222.5 million had gone into the highway fund, which gets money from the fuel tax, motor vehicle registrations, inspection fees and commercial vehicle fines. Seventy-eight percent of the fund goes to the Maine Department of Transportation's work on bridges and roads. Other portions go to the Maine State Police and the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
\
Lawmakers plan to fill the gap in the current budget year through personnel cuts, the closing of some rest stops, the axing of road projects, and other means.
\
Transportation Committee members from both parties on Thursday talked about the need for the fuel tax increase.
\
""I hate taxes,"" said Rep. Richard Cebra, R-Naples. ""(But) we're in a pretty deep pothole right now, and we've got to get out of it. I don't think there's a better way to do it. I don't like it, but here it is.""
\
Sen. Walter Gooley, R-Farmington, spoke about the need to maintain roads to keep Maine's largest industry, tourism, going. And Rep. Ann Peoples, D-Westbrook, said that if the money were spent wisely, the state would be creating jobs.
\
Also, part of the taxes would be paid by tourists visiting the state, she said.
\
""This, I think, is a net gain for the state, economically,"" she said.
\
Not everyone supported the plan.
\
Rep. Douglas Thomas, R-Ripley, said that if he voted for an 11-cent tax hike, residents in his district would ""have pitchforks, and they're going to be at the end of my road."" He said he understands the need to maintain the roads, but suggested that the current economic downturn is the wrong environment in which to increase taxes.
\
""I can't vote for a tax increase under these circumstances,"" he said. ""I think we need to give people a breather.""
\
Although Gov. John Baldacci has opposed broad-based tax increases in the past, he would consider a proposal that has broad bipartisan support, said David Farmer, his deputy chief of staff.
\
It's obvious, said Farmer, that the current method of funding the highway fund is problematic.
\
Representatives and senators on the Transportation Committee said they discussed the concept with their respective party leaders and received varying levels of support. Gooley said his caucus, the Senate Republicans, might be the toughest to convince. Senate Republican Leader Kevin Raye of Perrry said yesterday that the conversation on the fuel tax is just beginning.
\
""Republicans and tax increases are like oil and water,"" he noted. That said, ""Republicans are open to gaining a full understanding of what it is we face.""
\
Historically, he said, Republicans have supported investments in infrastructure. And removing the indexing function is important to his party, said Raye, as it has been ""widely unpopular.""
\
""Right now, it's all about the details,"" he said.
\
Dale Hanington, president and chief executive officer of the Maine Motor Transport Association, said his group wants to get rid of the indexing and is supportive of the overall proposal.
\
""It's a very delicate package,"" he said.

212,"AUGUSTA -- Gov. Angus King asked Maine motorists and truckers to pay more at the pump Friday by proposing a 5-cent-per-gallon increase to the state gas tax.\The governor also released a new $4.5 billion budget plan to cover the state's finances for the next two years beginning July 1. The budget bill provides increases for education and research and development. The package offers no new tax relief programs, but continues all of those currently in effect.\Both measures require the approval of the Maine Legislature for enactment, an outcome that appeared anything but certain Friday, according to leaders of the Democratic majorities in the state House and Senate.\With gasoline prices at all-time lows -- 87.9 cents for regular unleaded in the Augusta area -- administration officials observed there probably wouldn't be a better time to float the tax increase. It is the first increase in the fuel tax since 1991.\Mainers currently pay 18.4 cents in federal tax in addition to 19 cents per gallon in state tax for each gallon of gas they buy. Diesel fuel carries an identical federal tax and a 20-cent-per-gallon state tax. State taxes on both fuels would be increased by 5 cents per gallon under King's plan.\The tax increase is expected to generate $35 million in new revenues to improve state highway maintenance, rebuild many stretches of highway in northern, eastern and central Maine that must be posted seasonally for weight limitations, and help erase a projected $50 million gap in the $455 million State Highway Fund.\""The reason we're facing a deficit in the highway fund is the last increase in the gas tax was eight years ago and all the value of that increase has been taken away by inflation,"" King said. ""It's as if the gas tax was never increased. We can't continue to do the level of maintenance that the people demand.""\King said gas tax revenues continue to remain flat because even though motorists are driving more miles than they did in 1990, the technological improvements to automobile engines are yielding greater gas mileage.\""There's a billion and a half more miles being driven for the same amount of money,"" King said. ""The bottom line is that the Highway Fund is a pay-as-you-go system. The problem is that we're going more and not paying. Believe me, this has been one of the toughest decisions I've had to make around here.""\In addition to road improvements, King said the increase would allow the state to reduce its reliance on Department of Transportation bonding from $40 million over the two-year spending cycle to around $25 million.\""Right now we're paying 13 percent of the Highway Fund for debt service; it ought to be around half of that,"" King said. ""We're bonding instead of paying as you go. As a businessman, I think that's the wrong way to do it because you're paying debt service costs.""\During a briefing with State House reporters, King said he did not think that the burden of an increased gasoline tax would weigh more heavily on eastern and northern Maine motorists who routinely drive greater distances and earn less than their southern Maine counterparts.\""There are plenty of people in southern Maine who commute from Kennebunk to Portland,"" he said. ""There are a lot of commuters from the suburbs. There may be 10 people who commute from Houlton to Bangor, but there may be 100 people who commute from Casco to Portland. It's numbers.""\King and DOT Commissioner John Melrose said the silver lining on the increase for people in northern and eastern Maine will be found in an aggressive overhaul of the regions' posted roads. Melrose said the tax hike will allow the state to permanently unpost 100 miles of seasonally affected highways each year with the goal of eliminating the need for posting at all within 15 years.\The major increases in King's $4.5 billion budget -- up from $3.5 billion only four years ago -- can be found in education and tax relief. General Purpose Aid (GPA) for local education will increase over current funding by 4.25 percent in the first fiscal year and 3 percent in the second year or $28 million in the first year and $20 million in the second.\King emphasized those amounts do not include the $16 million in ""one-time money"" funded for education in last year's supplemental budget.\""That was always intended to be one-time money and was never intended to be built into the base,"" he said.\In addition to almost $50 million in new educational spending, King plans to inject $19 million into the state's revolving school renovation fund. The governor proposes a 3 percent increase in the first year and 2 percent in the second for the University of Maine System and the Maine Technical College System. Maine Maritime Academy would receive a 6 percent increase the first year and 2 percent the second because King said the school received proportionately less money than the other two insitutions in last year's budget.\King also put in $2 million a year to initiate a new community college project, and increased money for research and development. Last year, King and the Legislature approved a $5 million allocation for research and development in a supplemental budget package. Over the next two years, King wants to infuse the fund with $10 million in the first fiscal year and $15 million in the second.\""I said in the campaign that I wanted to make it $25 million {per year}; we weren't able to do that,"" King said. ""Basically what you see here is a straight relationship between research and development and GPA. These are the kinds of choices we were having to make.""\Neither House Speaker G. Steven Rowe, D-Portland, nor Senate President Mark W. Lawrence, D-Kittery, was initially receptive to King's proposed gas tax increase, saying they needed to know more about how the DOT funds various projects from the Highway Fund.\""I'm going to want to look at the transportation budget as a whole to make sure that we feel it is not only necessary to raise this money, but also that this is the best way to do it,"" said Rowe.\Both men expected there would be discussions over the specific amounts allocated for programs and services within the budget, but were generally happy with the approach King had taken.\""We're going to disagree on dollars and details, but I think the budget is moving in the right direction -- investing in education, economic development and the environment,"" Lawrence said."

While you grouse about high gasoline prices, think about this: You pay almost 50 cents tax on every gallon.
\
That's right: With every 20 gallons of gas that go into your vehicle, the state and federal governments suck almost $10 right out of your wallet.
\
Sort of gives new meaning to the phrase ""highway robbery,"" doesn't it?
\
Republican legislators got short shrift recently when they suggested removing the state gas tax for a short period to give us a break. The idea was sound.
\
I would bet you have made adjustments in your spending habits to accommodate the high cost of gas. Why can't the government do the same?
\
Please do not tell me that our roads and bridges need work so we cannot afford to short change the state's highway fund.
\
Lawmakers decided recently to spend $2 million to build a walkway across that new Waldo-Hancock bridge to indulge a few misguided people who want to walk across it.
\
They pave every state highway like it was the Wiscasset Speedway, then wring their hands when we drive too fast.
\
And you just know they are going to put that ugly fence back on Augusta's Memorial Bridge, when we most assuredly do not want it.
\
I have seen highway workers standing along the roadside holding ""Slow"" signs. It does not take a genius to figure out that a flashing stand-alone sign would be twice as effective and far less dangerous -- and cheaper.
\
I would be very pleased to have the Maine Department of Transportation lower its highway-reconstruction standards -- and I would be happy to make suggestions. Elimination of curbing in rural areas would be at the top of my list. I would bet you could come up with suggestions, too.
\
But that would violate the DOT bible, which I have just digested with my lunch. The bible is titled ""Losing Ground,"" and it is a report on the sorry state of Maine's Highway Fund, prepared by the Maine Better Transportation Association and published in July.
\
Taken at face value, it will scare the heck out of you -- and probably cause you to hunker down at home and never venture out onto highways and bridges, which are death traps.
\
Summing up the whole mess, largely caused by lack of funding, the report's executive summary states, ""This entire scenario translates into a threat to the economy, public safety and the environment."" The report indicates that you should not set out on the highway unless you ""feel lucky.""
\
I would add that you had better feel flush, too, because a full wallet is just as important today as a full tank of gas -- indeed, one equals the other.
\
Diving into the report, I find the real problem: you. Even though the state's population has only increased 30 percent in the past 30 years, you have more cars and more drivers in your household today. And -- darn you -- you have moved to the country with longer commutes to work and shopping.
\
Hey, don't blame me: I work at home and do all my shopping at the Mount Vernon country store, which I can reach by boat or on foot.
\
In 1970, there were 500,000 licensed drivers in Maine. Today, there are 920,000. In that same period, the number of registered motor vehicles increased from 500,000 to 1.4 million -- more than one vehicle per person.
\
Vehicle miles of travel grew 95 percent between 1970 and 1990 and another 19 percent between 1990 and 2000 -- to reach a staggering 14.3 billion vehicle miles of travel a year. Can't more people stay home once in a while?
\
The proportion of Maine freight shipped by road increased from 65 percent in 1982 to 87 percent today.
\
Almost all of Maine's highway improvements are funded by what they like to call ""user fees."" Sixty-nine percent of those fees come from fuel taxes. The rest come from excise taxes and the sale of licenses and registrations.
\
These funds are not keeping up with the needs and demands for highways and bridges in Maine, according to this report.
\
""A day of reckoning is approaching,"" warns the report.
\
Nearly 4,000 miles of state roads ""have yet to be rehabilitated to modern-day standards"" (see comment above about the Wiscasset Speedway). And ""1,048 bridges are older than 50 years and in need of major rehabilitation or replacement.
\
""With the exception of extraordinary bridges, those costing in excess of $5 million, the state is making no perceptible progress in tackling the ever-growing bubble of bridge needs,"" says the report.
\
There is a lot more in this report and none of it is encouraging.
\
Oregon may give us a glimpse into our traveling future. A state task force there has recommended replacing the gas tax with a tax based on how many miles a person drives. In that case, the old joke might come true: We may not be able to get there from here.

215,"The LePage administration is proposing a fee on hybrid and electric vehicles. Owners of these types of cars and environmental groups strongly oppose the proposed fees.\The proposal, LD 1806, is aimed at resolving a real problem -- Maine has far too little money to pay for needed road and bridge maintenance and repair. The bill calls for an annual registration fee of $150 for hybrid vehicles and $250 for battery-electric vehicles. The fee is needed, Meghan Russo of the Maine Department of Transportation told the Portland Press Herald, because owners of these vehicles don't contribute much, if anything, to road work through the state's gas tax.\A public hearing on LD 1806 is scheduled for 1 p.m. Tuesday before the Legislature's Transportation Committee.\The debate highlights real and challenging concerns. Maine needs more money for its infrastructure, but it shouldn't discourage the ownership of fuel-efficient, low-emissions vehicles that are better for our environment and health.\The simplest way to begin to resolve this problem would be to raise the state's fuel taxes, which is now 30 cents per gallon for gasoline and 31 cents per gallon for diesel fuel. This is unchanged since 2011.\These tax rates were adjusted annually for inflation until 2011, when indexing was repealed. Now, like federal fuel taxes, it is not keeping pace with transportation needs. The gas tax shortfall is exacerbated by an overall increase in fuel economy among U.S. vehicles and the fact that Americans are driving less.\In Maine, combined state and federal funding falls short of meeting transportation goals set in state statute by $59 million per year. This figure from the Maine Department of Transportation underestimates the shortfall because the department includes in its tally an expected $100 million per year from bonds, money that is far from assured. More than 19 percent of the state's bridges are functionally obsolete, and 18 percent of state highway miles are rated poor or unacceptable.\Simply put, Maine -- and the federal government -- need more money to pay for transportation needs. Raising the gas tax or assessing a fee on electric and hybrid vehicles in isolation won't fill the funding backlog. Instead, a comprehensive approach is needed.\A bill carried over from last session, LD 1149, would be a good starting point for this discussion. The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Andrew McLean, a Gorham Democrat who is the House chair of the Legislature's Transportation Committee, includes a 7 cent per gallon fuel tax increase, a $200 surcharge on hybrid and electric vehicle registrations, a $3 increase in many motor vehicle-related charges at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. The legislation would also devote 10 percent of the sales tax on transportation-related items to the Highway Fund.\McLean also proposed a study into using a miles-traveled fee system as an alternative to the gas tax. Oregon is testing such a system. A Congressional Budget Office study found that vehicle-miles traveled fees are less onerous on low-income and rural households than fuel taxes because these households tend to own older, less fuel-efficient vehicles.\Maine's road and bridge work backlog has had big consequences in the past -- think of the unexpected closure of the Waldo-Hancock bridge and the big detours it necessitated -- and will have damaging impacts going forward. Lawmakers can't keep ignoring the problem.\Follow BDN Editorial & Opinion on Facebook for the latest opinions on the issues of the day in Maine.\"

Our roads have taken a real beating this winter, made worse by years of deferred maintenance. Our bridges, rail lines, airports and seaports also have lacked proper maintenance. Our statewide transportation infrastructure is suffering, and delaying repairs only makes matters worse. In order to fix our transportation network, however, state leaders in Augusta must have an honest conversation about our needs.
\
Every time we fuel up at the pump, we pay state and federal gas taxes. The federal gas tax has remained unchanged at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993, and our state gas tax is below the national average. Moreover, Mainers are driving in cars that are becoming increasingly more fuel-efficient, which means that we're buying fewer gallons of gas per vehicle. This is good for our environment and our health, but when we buy less gas, we contribute fewer dollars over the course of the year to the Highway Fund, the pot of money used to finance the maintenance and construction of our roads and bridges.
\
The needs of our transportation system have not remained stagnant, however, they've grown dramatically. Roads are crumbling, bridges are deficient, and we're not making the smart, strategic plans needed to effectively move people and goods from place to place.
\
Reliance on an ever-decreasing Highway Fund has led to an annual shortfall of $150 million to fund our most basic of transportation needs, just maintaining what we have, so we're forced to bond for many of our road maintenance needs. While bonding is a viable financing option, it should be used for long-term projects and not year-to-year maintenance. Consequently, we have no money available for any new roads or long-term transformational projects.
\
If nothing is done about the Highway Fund shortfall, the condition of our roads today will seem terrific compared to what they will look like in five years.
\
The long-term neglect of our transportation system has set back Maine's economy. A 21st century economy needs a 21st century transportation network. After we've spent these last two years on the Transportation Committee, nothing could be more clear: We need to invest in our transportation system -- and soon.
\
Imagine the Maine economy without the interstate, our three cargo ports, rail service to Aroostook or the Portland and Bangor airports. What would our midcoast economy look like without the Sagadahoc or Penobscot Narrows bridges? What is the cost of posted roads and bridges that force motorists and truckers to find longer, alternative routes? What are the costs of time-consuming delays in traffic-congested areas such as Gorham and Westbrook or Augusta and Waterville? And what about the extraordinary expenses and loss of productivity associated with accidents resulting from unsafe conditions and the auto repair costs we incur every year from the cavernous holes in our roads?
\
The sticker price to fix our transportation infrastructure is shocking to a lot of people and doesn't include the additional modernization that we need. But the cost of failing to fix our transportation system is far greater than the cost of properly maintaining it. This is an area where pragmatic people, regardless of political party, should be able to find common ground.
\
By providing for a 21st century transportation system, we can save money by paying less for traffic delays that take away time from family and work, lost jobs with companies that cannot afford Maine's transportation deficiencies, accidents with personal injury or loss of life and higher insurance rates or car repairs for bent wheel rims, tie rods, front end alignments and the like.
\
Ensuring the vitality of our transportation system is not a partisan issue. It's a Maine issue. We know we cannot stay on this bumpy road for much longer. The next Legislature must take steps to close the transportation funding gap and make smart plans to rebuild our roads and bridges that will reduce our long-term costs and grow our economy.
\
How we do this is a different conversation, but it is one that is taking place.

Deane Rykerson (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Lack of planning. We need to look at the future and invest in statewide broadband and renewable energy.
[image id=""2706600"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Budget surplus.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
A safety net for all Mainers.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, mileage and weight fee rather than increased gas tax.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Renewable energy creates jobs, lessens health problems, enhances Maine's environment, stops money from leaving the state for fossil fuels, and slows the effects of climate disruption.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Loosened. Access for all who need it.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
For Question 1. There is no reason the wealthy should pay less percentage of taxes than the middle class.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, ranked choice worked well in primaries.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine's economic development barriers are workforce and infrastructure. Demographically, we have been an aging state for over a decade and our state needs to continue the work around technology and educational systems to attract innovation and growth to Maine. I know Mainers have the hard work in them to make a bright future possible.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The funding of Medicaid expansion will be an important issue for the next Legislature and one with potentially significant impact to the state budget. We must focus on taking care of those most in need and find a sustainable, balanced solution. The next legislature working with the new Governor needs to find adequate dollars within the state budget. It's worth looking across ideas such as the exchanges and the Healthy Maine Fund if they can fit into a sustainable, fiscally responsible answer.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
To me, welfare reform means providing solid routes back to self-sufficiency. Assistance to Mainers in need is important �"" and part of that is being a bridge to independence. It makes fiscal sense to move people from dependency to self-sufficiency. There are opportunities to implement work search and volunteer requirements on Temporary Assistance For Needy Families recipients would comply with federal law. We want and need adults returning to work.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Reviewing how roads and bridges are maintained thru town, county and state funds is part of addressing Maine's infrastructure needs. We know that the gas tax approach is under pressure from fuel efficiency and electric vehicles, as well as just normal inflation. We need to look at how roads are paid for and what is needed for us to get the bridges, roads and transportation system we need today and for tomorrow that won't over burden the most vulnerable among us.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Incentives for renewable energy technologies as part of Maine's overall energy portfolio is a worthwhile discussion as long as one recognizes that incentives cannot come at the expense of rate payers. Since Maine is a net energy exporter, the market is doing a good. The price of transmission has increased 250% over that same period and that may bear looking at.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
At this time, Maine has a balanced approach to respecting the decision made in Roe v Wade
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting no on Question 1. There are many concerns with this initiative �"" from oversight to wait list issues, from the incredibly high tax burden to privacy concerns. It's an example of why it is imperative that Maine return to the legislative process. Aging in place is an important conversation that deserves a better solution for Maine's seniors.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I am not in favor at this time of a constitutional amendment to allow rank choice voting. We are at a time where we want to encourage more voting �"" not make it more complicated and in many ways, ranked choice deprives voters of an informed choice. Plurality has a long history in Maine and exists for good reason. The best solution isn't an expensive change to the way we vote, it is to vote. It's our responsibility.

Bradley S. Moulton (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
barriers to job training and sufficient efforts to reduce them. As one small step, secondary schools need guidance counselors tracking all students, not just college bound, and ensure completion of certificate and other job training resulting in jobs that pay a livable wage. The Legislature needs to take direction from all stakeholders as to how to achieve results, different than the type of top down approach employed in 2011-12, that is frustrating many school systems just for education.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
use of dedicated funds, such as tobacco settlement funds, is not appropriate, nor is dedicating income tax from a specific income group. It will require taking back income tax cuts for higher income families rather than slashing education and other state programs. No magic pill here, folks.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I studied the social welfare system as a social work major in college, along with two internships, Child Protective Services, Region 1 (Portland) DHS in the 1970's. One of the larger problems currently is the cliff between welfare and employment for people to transition successfully. That should be included in the term quoted in the question along with a whole lot more space than permitted here.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Finally, someone asked the question besides a constituent for whom I promised a bill. As over 33 other states have done, we need to increase the gas tax plus employ a mileage basis for non-gas and hybrid vehicles, and initiate a ""transportation cost fairness credit"" on the Maine income tax form to lessen the regressive tax burden for lower income Mainers.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Lessening of reliance upon fossil fuels and breaking down electric service into more manageable regional units striving to work towards a balanced, or zero, energy consumption should be incorporated in any long-range energy program for the state. That would also include solar and wind, but a whole lot more.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
We need to do a whole lot better raising our children reducing the need for divorce and abortion, especially for children undergoing the trauma of breakdown for too many families. This problem goes way beyond a legislative fix and falls squarely upon our families, communities, and society to address. As a legislator, I reluctantly voted against five of six abortion-related bills because they were defective and would not have directly addressed the individual decisions resulting in abortion.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
My vote is no better or worse than anyone else's for a referendum question brought from outside the legislature, and therefore, not relevant. I do however, find many flaws in funding and operation that I cannot detail in the space provided for the ballot question produced by an agenda-driven special interest organization.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No, as an attorney and voter, I do not believe it would ever comply with the principle of one person, one vote, as found currently in our constitution. All that I see is manipulation and playing games creating an unequal playing field worse than the choices voters must make at the polls without ranked choice voting.

Charles Galemmo (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
What companies are not looking for tax breaks for the wealthiest or deregulation. We have done that and are 36 in the country for economic growth. Business is looking for low property taxes on the parcels they build their stores, factories and other businesses. They are looking for good infrastructure and a workforce with the skills they need. They are looking for communities with good services and schools. They also want middle class people with money to spend at their locations.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The legislature passed a bill that addressed those concerns. The Governor's veto was wrong. Their is plenty of money in our budget. It simply needs to be made a priority.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
It means ensuring low income seniors and children do not go hungry or cold in the winter, that they have access to healthcare and a roof over their heads.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
It would be better to have infrastructure maintenance on a schedule and paid for out of the general fund. We can only borrow for so long and the interest payment is wasted money.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. There are more solar jobs in Massachusetts than coal jobs in the US. Maine has the lowest number of clean energy jobs per capita of any state in New England. Further, renewable energy on the micro-grid is much less expensive than building large generating plants and power lines.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
A women's right to choose is between her, her doctor and those she chooses to confide in. The government should not be involved in this most intimate and challenging of decisions. If we are to reduce the number of abortions we do so by mitigating the economic concerns which are the leading reason women opt for the procedure and improve access to birth control.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I am in favor. Whether the question ultimately passes or fails, we must deal with this issue and make it so seniors can retire in their homes with dignity. Passage of the question will only force the decision.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. First it is the will of the people and government must adhere to that will. Second I believe that after people get accustomed to it third party candidates will have a better chance of winning allowing more varied views in our political discourse.
Noah Cobb (U)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Better, more adaptive education is the best method to achieve economic development. This includes University, Community College and Trade Schools.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Maine already has a growing rainy day fund that is not being used, which means we have a surplus of tax funding as it is.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Stream lining current programs so that there is less waste, less abuse and tax payers are getting more benefits for the money spent.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes it should. It should probably be a combination of transportation taxes that address the loss of gas taxes. That way the loss or lower of one does not undo the system and none hurt the average person too much.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
I believe in the technologies but until they are more efficient the state should not be subsidizing. The free market should decide.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I think they are correct as is in Maine.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against. It is too much policy in a citizen initiative that should be worked out by lawmakers. The question as is will create as many problems as it claims to solve.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. RCV is the best way to make sure peoples preferred ideals are expressed through out an election. It gives people a piece of mind that they are not throwing away their vote on a Candidate with less of a chance. Maine has amended its constitution 173 times. One more is not as big an issue as people make it out to be.

Christopher W. Babbidge (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Businessowners' concern statewide is the same: workforce, workforce, workforce. More engineers are needed from UMaine and USM. We must help professionals come here and stay here. More public-private partnerships through community colleges can give trainees immediate high-paying jobs. Retiring baby boomers can contribute by sharing their expertise. Many CEOs want to live here, but to open a branch in Maine they need internet connectivity and an educated labor force to make it work.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We already have the money. This investment has a 9-to-1 return. I support a general fund obligation, not dedicated funds. M.E. will cover our most vulnerable working Mainers, help healthcare institutions remain solvent, and protect our healthcare workforce. $500 million in federal money for the Maine economy helps us all. Most states, including those governed by Christie and Kasich, put peoples' needs first. We must do the same, acccepting the 9-1 match as Mainers directed in referendum.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Helping the young, the old, and severely challenged is good for ALL of us. They then pay taxes and buy goods and services. Welfare reform means efficiency and effectiveness to give a hand up, and REPLACING what isn't working with something better. It is NOT irresponsible across-the-board cuts that hurt good and necessary programs, force caregivers to redirect their professional lives elsewhere, and leave our most vulnerable alone to figure it out. We can do this AND be fiscally responsible.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Most transportation dollars come from transportation bonds and the gas tax, the latter a dwindling figure due to the success of federal CAFÉ standards. All of us get better mileage than we used to. Mainers who step up and pay extra for a high mileage vehicle or hybrid car are voluntarily emitting less carbon pollution, and we must not de-incentivize responsible choices. We need to examine taking a bigger piece of Maine Turnpike tolls which are paid in part by out-of-staters.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Renewable energy is good for Maine's air quality, the respiratory and skin health of our children, and new business growth. We should promote incentives permitting lower-income Mainers to also benefit. Community solar should be expanded. The U.S. is in danger of falling behind in the technology race to harness solar and wind, but Maine's solar entrepreneurs and the University of Maine's ocean wind initiative are positioned to be industry leaders if Maine government permits their growth.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
We must improve access to reproductive healthcare for low-income Mainers, and protect the healthcare professionals who serve them. All-male legislatures throughout history have outlawed birth control and abortion. Sex education and birth control are essential for women to decide. No woman should be forced by government to carry an unwanted pregnancy. I fully support a woman with mental, physical or financial health issues who wants to get herself in a better place before becoming a parent.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Sadly true: Social Security deductions are taken only from middle-class levels of income. But this proposal has consequences and opportunity costs that I don't yet know. The new Board may have conflict-of-interest concerns and no real legislative oversight. This 15-page bill has not undergone the scrutiny integral to the legislative process: sponsorship, public hearings, work sessions, committee votes, press coverage with constituent response, floor debate, and final enactment vote.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Majorities have been oppressive & resistant to reform, causing constitutional freedoms to be created. It's bad that a few voters for an extremist 3rd candidate, by their 2nd choice in RCV, can override the plurality winner.But governors should have a mandate as expressed by a majority vote. I will vote for wording that simply requires a majority. Run-off elections are clean and simple, but ranked-choice voting is 2nd best, and is preferable to the status quo in expressing the people's will.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Many Maine students leave to pursue better paying and high tech opportunities in other states. We are not attracting or retaining companies that could create these jobs. Maine must shore up current and start-up businesses by offering tax incentives, providing renewable energy credits, and refurbishing facilities. Students who remain or return should be assisted in paying down student loans. With our expanding senior population, healthcare jobs will grow, so school loan assistance is win/win.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Medicaid expansion benefits hard-working people in low-wage jobs without health insurance. While Gov. LePage refused this, 17 other states with Republican governors (including then Indiana Gov. Mike Pence) approved it. Billions of federal dollars were not taken. Mainers without coverage have no checkups and do not seek help when ill. They use the ER, the most costly treatment. This can be eliminated through expansion. Providing quality healthcare should never be a political battleground.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The term ""welfare reform"" often implies failure and prejudges without knowing the facts about the recipient. Many are mothers of small children, or men and women who may be disabled, or those in low paying jobs, or workers whose skills do not match current needs. Requiring adults who are able-bodied without small children to work, train, or volunteer is appropriate to continue to receive assistance. We must keep our minds open to assist those in genuine need.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Our Governor and legislature often use bonds as a reward/punishment tool. Bonds are an undependable method of infrastructure upkeep. We have borrowed $832 million in this century alone! We must revisit our gas tax, tolls, obtaining Federal dollars, and methods of transportation. Improving rail transport and our ports would further remove traffic from our roads. New construction adds jobs which improve our economy and the quality of our lives and that of our tourists.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The days of dependence on fossil fuels must end. Burning oil is costly and bad for the environment. We must turn to green energy such as wind, solar, and hydro. We should protect our natural resources, our forests, our water quality, our shoreline, and our wildlife before they are further harmed. Providing tax credits to homes, businesses, and farms that go green and weatherize will result it a healthier state. We also must never elect another Governor who denies climate change.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Maine must grant access to abortion free of judgment, restriction, intimidation, and harassment in a safe, comfortable, affordable environment. The decision a woman makes for ending a pregnancy is difficult enough without the intervention of hostile, harmful groups. Funding assistance through Medicaid should not be denied and even be increased to make abortion accessible to all women. We cannot ever return to the days where women were punished and even died seeking unsafe abortions.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
A false assumption is that area elderly are comfortable and require no help. I meet seniors in lovely homes who live alone without help who are house poor. I also see those who are not wealthy who are in dire need. An elderly Wells woman died and her body was not found for 2 years! Universal care would ensure our seniors and disabled have proper assistance, would grow jobs, and help our economy. While it is not perfect, I nevertheless support this program.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Mainers pride themselves on being independent. Many refuse to be identified with a political party. Consequently, we frequently have a three or even four-way split where the person who wins may do so without receiving a majority of the votes. LePage won with 37.6% in 2010 and 48.2% in 2014. Having ranked-choice voting allows for the true majority of voters to designate a winner in excess of 50%. This is a much fairer system and one I would support with ranked-choice voting.

James Booth (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
As long as Maine is in the top 10 in every Tax category ,economic development will lag behind. The Legislature could start by adopting some of NH tax structure. NH has no Income tax or Sales. Property taxes are close for Maine #9 and NH #7 for highest in country.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Reduce the state budget by the exact amount that is needed to fund the expansion.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Reforming welfare means people that really need welfare should not be on a waiting list. And adults with no children and aren't themselves handicap should not receive Welfare.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
No
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Expanding incentives means taking money from one area and putting it in another. I don't want to take money from our most vulnerable just to subsidized millionaires.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Parents should be notified before access to abortion.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
No, Small Business killer! If this passes a lot of people will leave the State and we will be the Number 1 State for Taxation.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. With the primary in June as an example who in they're right mind would want RCV? Took two weeks to determine the winner and now Mr. Dunlap needs more money because of the cost overruns due to the RCV. If elections aren't broken why fix it?

Ryan M. Fecteau (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
A significant portion of the Maine workforce is reaching retirement age. We need to double down our efforts to train and retain our young people. I've sponsored legislation to send a bond to voters that would invest $40 million in our vocational schools. Maine's 27 vocational schools have not received an injection of state resources since a 1998 voter-approved $5 million bond.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The legislature in June of this year approved $60 million in funding for expansion. The figure was based on the LePage Administration's estimate which was higher than independent studies. Even though Gov. LePage continued to say there was no funding to implement expansion, he vetoed the very bill that would fund expansion. It's clear that we need leadership in Augusta that respects the will of voters and implements expansion. There are numerous studies that suggest expansion will pay for itself.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform refers to policy changes that ensure the most vulnerable in our state have access to the safety net that provides them the opportunities to get back on their feet. In addition, there has been a focus on ensuring there are more programs for persons to be trained in sectors that provide more bountiful employment than perhaps what they had prior to falling on hard times.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
This is obviously a very challenging issue since vehicles are becoming more and more fuel efficient; yet, road and highway usage is still significant. In 2013, Virginia passed a reform package regarding how they fund transportation infrastructure that I think is worth exploring. The Federal Highway Administration has offered states technology that charges users based on miles traveled. We definitely need to think outside the box on this issue.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely. We are falling behind many other states that have recognized the economic opportunities that solar and wind generation offer. In fact, we are losing young people to employers in other states that have been provided incentives to grow and implement their technologies. The average median wage in the solar industry, for example, is $26 per hour and a national census reports that 79% of companies do not require a bachelor's degree for new hires.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Any proposal to restrict a woman's right to make her own decisions concerning her reproductive health should be defeated. I strongly believe that individuals should be able to make these decisions in good conscience.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I'll be supporting Question 1. First, I should say that I do not agree with all the mechanics of the proposal and believe the legislature will have an obligation to make adjustments when implementing the law. However, I know that taking care of an elderly family member has a real financial and psychological toll on too many Mainers. We cannot expect Mainers to work full-time and take on the full-time job of caring for elderly family. Not to mention, our seniors deserve dignity as they age.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. Voters have twice approved ranked-choice voting for our elections and the constitution should be amended to reflect this.

Victoria Foley (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
We need to put policies in place that encourage young people to settle in Maine and contribute to our economy. Our education system needs to set students up for success - training today's youth for tomorrow's economy, including the trades and careers that support our aging population.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The members of the House need to work together to find a way to fund the expansion voters have approved.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Social services are necessary to assist our neighbors who are in need, providing people training, support, and a path back to independence. Children and our most vulnerable populations deserve our compassion and caring, which means appropriately funding social service programs.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Funding our roads, bridges, and other infrastructure is imperative to the growth of our economy. We are in a transformative period in transportation and communication, and we have to find better ways to structure the funding. I don't yet have solutions, but I am strongly in favor of acknowledging that improvement is possible, and I am eager to be part of the discussion of new options.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Diversifying the sources of our energy is beneficial for jobs, for the environment, and for our energy security.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Women should be able to make their own healthcare decisions, and make those choices free from harassment and intimidation.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting against Question 1. We need to do all we can to help our elders remain in their homes and age in place. It is not clear that the initiative as written can be implemented in a way that ensures the funds are managed with accountability to the Mainers paying into the system.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Voters have made it clear they support ranked-choice voting, and the Legislature needs to continue to work to clarify how that looks within our state election system.
House District 13: (Map) Old Orchard Beach
Lori K. Gramlich (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
A significant barrier to economic development is the lack of trained and skilled workers in health care and the trade industry. The Legislature can and should provide solutions to advance workforce training for health care workers and trades jobs. Additionally college tuition costs have soared. Providing incentives for reducing costs for college, workforce training and student loan forgiveness are all possible remedies to addressing this issue.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
It is the legislature's responsibility to follow the will of the voter. Many individuals face barriers to the care they need, and businesses are struggling to provide coverage for their employees. Medicaid expansion will provide a 90% match in funding from the Federal Government �"" something other states have done through the ACA, and have already seen the benefits of relative to funding. Additionally, there will be less uncompensated/charity care provided in our state, with expansion.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare has historically been intended to provide safety net supports to get through unforeseen circumstances whether it is a lack of housing, food, clothing, or jobs. Examining current programs built on the achievements of our past provides a basis for determining changes to meet social service needs. Policies using a strengths-based perspective will provide better outcomes for both cost effectiveness and will provide individuals the tools and resources they may need to get back on their feet.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, the state needs to re-examine infrastructure funding. While bonds leverage additional federal funding, we need a funding mix to meet the needs of our state. Obtaining input from experts in the field and examining successes from other states relative to infrastructure funding is a first step. State gas tax rates have not been evaluated for nearly a decade. These rates could be evaluated annually and go back to being indexed to the rate of inflation to accommodate transportation funding.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely. Providing incentives for renewable energy technologies are investments in our future �"" not only are these evolving technologies good for our climate and environment, they are also sound economic development initiatives, in that new jobs are created due to these advancing technologies. We need to shift our reliance from fossil fuels to emerging renewable resources.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Women's decisions regarding her health and health care should be between her and her doctor. I support all women having access to affordable healthcare.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
As Mainers are living longer, more engaged lives, the importance of insuring our residents are able to live out their lives in their own homes is imperative. It is more cost effective for folks to stay in their homes than it is for them to live in facilities. To that end, I support providing home care services, not only for our seniors, but also for other folks with challenges which might otherwise prevent them from living enriched, independent lives and will be voting for Question 1.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
While previous legislatures have been apprehensive of amending our constitution, the people of Maine passed this referendum and the constitution should reflect that. Ranked choice voting is a way to build consensus for a candidate instead of a candidate winning who is not supported by the majority of Maine voters.

Donna Bailey (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Keeping and attracting workers. Public/private partnerships between local industries, to train workers in those areas that industry leaders identify as future needed skills. Expand our tax incentive programs for those willing to move to and work in areas of the state that are underserved. Tax incentives to businesses that offer programs to pay for workers education, re-training, relocation to the State and/or student loan debt relief. Support the Opportunity Maine Tax Credit Program.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
One of largest parts of any state budge, is the ongoing need for social services to help give a hand up. In addition to dedicating money to the Rainy Day Fund, dedicate a separate fund for social service programs, including MaineCare. The Social Services Fund, like the Rainy Day Fund, should be added to during times the state enjoys a surplus, and would be there when there are insufficient funds, in the General Fund to fully fund the State's share of ongoing needed social service programs.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform means the continuing examination of our social services programs to see where and how we can improve them, both in outcomes and delivery. We also need to insure those that need the help receive it, but those who don't are not allowed to defraud the system. It may also mean eliminating some programs, while adding others, as times change, and needs change. Social service programs, like societies themselves, are not static.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Adequate and predictable funding to maintain our roads and bridges is crucial to our safety, prosperity and economy. Relying on borrowing to fund our infrastructure is passing our responsibility on to future generations. Distance based user fees, with an initial yearly amount exempted for Maine residents; in combination with managed lanes in highly congested areas is the direction we should be exploring. Borrowing should be reserved for more big investment projects.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes Maine should do everything possible to encourage renewable energy technologies. Almost every survey indicates the lack of affordable energy is an impediment to more businesses locating in the State. We need to expand and invest in our renewable fuel and energy alternatives to lower our energy costs, both for homeowners and for businesses. Renewable energy jobs are also a fast growing industry that we should expand and attract more of to the State.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe a woman's right to choose should be respected and maintained. Such a personal decision should be made by a woman in consultation with her doctor, family, friends, and faith, as she chooses. Curtailing access to abortion and reproductive health services does not decrease the numbers of abortions; it only increases the number of unsafe abortions.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting for Question 1. Although I think the funding mechanism in the initiative will need to be re-examined by the Legislature, it is crucial that we look at this crucial issue for our Seniors. It does not make sense that we are willing to spend thousands of dollars to place someone in a nursing home, but we are not willing to spend the same or even less money to provide the needed care for them in their own home.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes I support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative elections, because the voters have been clear that is the system they would like.
Frederick Samp (U)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
We have a demographic problem here in Maine - an aging population without enough younger people moving to or remaining in Maine to support this population. Two recent studies completed under the auspices of several organizations make a number of Legislative recommendations designed to grow the size of Maine's workforce, improve the skills of Maine's workers, improve high speed broadband access and make Maine a leader in health care cost containment, health insurance coverage and public health.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The Legislature approved funding in 2018, but the Governor vetoed the measure out of misplaced concern for long-term funding sources. The potential benefits to Maine of expansion are so overwhelming that State funding should not be a serious concern, and with a new Governor and Legislature, the expansion should be in position to move forward.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The term ""welfare reform"" should be limited to the search for improvements to programs designed to deliver an agreed level of services and to meet stated social goals as efficiently as possible. Many have publicly used the term to describe individual beliefs that the level of services should be increased or decreased or that social goals should change.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
An increasing share of state and federal gas taxes should be dedicated to improving the infrastructure for alternatives more efficient than the private automobile. As the measurement technology develops, it will become necessary to rely more on user fees to fund the maintenance of roads and bridges.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The development of renewable energy technologies will become increasingly important as the public becomes less tolerant of the drawbacks to traditional fossil fuel-based energy sources and as governmental responses to climate change require major technology shifts. As these changes take place, the cost differential between renewable and traditional technologies will likely diminish and the need for incentives will be reduced. Nevertheless, incentive programs will probably still be necessary.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Maine has very few laws that actively restrict abortion access, and I would not advocate further restrictions.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting against Question 1. The underlying legislation is long, complex and covers a number of subjects. It includes three new taxes - a personal payroll tax, a corporate excise tax and an individual income tax. It makes a major change to Maine's labor laws and sets up a complex governance structure. Citizen initiatives do not work well when they cover so many disparate subjects. The question printed on the ballot does not begin to describe the legislation adequately.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I support such a constitutional amendment. The advantages of ranked-choice voting in reducing the need to engage in strategic voting and in elevating the level of political discourse during campaigns are well documented. The experience in recent primary elections in Maine demonstrates that ranked-choice ballots can be simple and easily understood.
Stephen R. DuPuis (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Taxes are the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine. Roll back the top tax rate to between zero and five percent.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
There needs to be a longer term, sustainable funding without increasing taxes and without stealing funds from more needy needs in the State such as School Funding and existing MaineCare programs.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The welfare reform means we need to improve the way we deliver aid to the most needy citizens in our State and make sure that the funds that we do spend are used by the citizens they are intended for and not by those that are capable of working in some capacity.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
There is no easy and quick solution to the infrastructure funding mechanisms. I feel that it is something we need to explore further. I would survey what other States have done to address this problem and see if any of these solutions have potential here in Maine.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
One thing the State of Maine should do is allow Small Wind Energy systems and home solar projects to sell all of there excess power to the grid and not just allow a credit against their usage. This is the case in New Hampshire and allows the economics of renewable power to not only benefit the homeowners but allows the rest of the consumers of the electric grid to benefit from renewable energy.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I don't believe any State funds should go to organizations that perform abortions here in the State.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will voting against Question 1. I believe that this referendum question is illegal. All funding bills must start in the Maine House of Representatives, not in the referendum process. This is a job killer because it would raise the State income tax rate above 10 percent and drive wealthy residents to leave. The only group left to pay the tab, would be the middle class here in Maine.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I would not support a constitutional amendment to allow ranked choice voting here in the State. The current system of plurality works well, is simple and straight forward.

Margaret O'Neil (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Strengthening our workforce: There are great jobs available now, and employers are struggling to connect with workers to fill those openings. The legislature must continue to partner with Maine employers to tailor our education system to prepare Maine students for jobs that are in demand and will continue to be in demand such as nursing, engineering, and the trades. We must also continue our work to attract newcomers to Maine through student loan credits.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Last year, the governor requested dedicated funding from the legislature and then vetoed that funding once the legislature provided it. This November, Maine voters have the opportunity to elect a governor who will implement Medicaid Expansion. I will be ready to take necessary legislative action to support this effort.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Regardless of party, the governor and legislature should seek to increase efficiency as we work toward our outcomes each year. We have much work ahead to make sure our investments at the state level best serve the people of Maine and to ensure that limited public dollars go to most effectively benefit the least fortunate among us. As for the term ""welfare reform"" itself, it's time to create a new way to discuss efficiency as we support Mainers working to lift themselves out of poverty.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Our state has significant infrastructure needs across all of our regions. The city of Saco is a great example with our longstanding commuter traffic. I am open to new funding methods that will help us invest in the infrastructure that serves us and helps us get where we need to be safely.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
We should absolutely encourage renewable energy technologies in Maine. After missed opportunities in the previous legislature, particularly with solar, the next legislature has no time to waste.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I will not support policies that seek to restrict a woman's access to reproductive healthcare. Such decisions are personal and made between a patient and her medical provider.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
This is a tough issue for me. Seniors and Mainers with disabilities should be able to remain in their homes whenever possible. I speak regularly with constituents who are having a hard time keeping themselves or a loved one in their home due to the cost of care or the time away from work. That said, I won't be supporting question 1. I have concerns with the funding mechanism. The next governor and the legislature must have the political will to address this through the legislative process.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I did not personally vote for Ranked Choice at the ballot box. However, as a legislator, I have supported a constitutional amendment because the people of Maine voted to establish a ranked-choice system, and I heard from many constituents who asked me to support such an amendment. It is my top priority to represent my district in the legislature as I make decisions.
Joseph Lynch (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Governor LePage has set the stage by cutting back regulations and taxes but we need to continue to foster the growing economy.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We cannot just spend money we don't have. As an accountant I understand bills need to get paid.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Stopping the abuse in the system.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I am not a big fan of borrowing but since the cost of construction continues to grow faster than the interest rates we pay it doesn't make sense to put off projects until we have the money.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Too many of these are schemes to pay off politically connected people with tax dollars and have nothing to do with conservation.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
The laws should be restricted. We should provide funding for resources and education to men and women to prevent pregnancies.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against, I think it needs more work before it can be put into action. Unfortunately, I feel it leaves a lot of opportunity for misuse and poor oversight.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No, just look at the primary elections. It is just another ploy to confuse voters who are unfamiliar with the process before voting and took too much time and additional resources to come to a conclusion.

Dave Durrell (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The single biggest barrier right now is population stagnation. We need to work to keep our young people in Maine and to attract more people to the state. Educational diversity for the good job opportunities we have and wage growth are key to those goals.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The legislature proposed several methods of initially funding it, all of which the governor rejected. The funding should ultimately come from the general fund, as part of the DHHS budget. That would have been difficult this year, as the second year of a bi-annual budget, which is why the legislature sought more creative means of funding this past year. The governor was disingenuous in this regard, and he got the House GOP caucus behind him, costing the state hundreds of millions of dollars.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The DHHS aids and protects the most vulnerable of our people, including children and the elderly. We have a moral societal duty to do this, and in the case of children we are also investing in our own future. We obviously want to do this as efficiently and cost effectively as possible, but not by cutting caseworkers or harming people. In terms of general aid, the term is often used negatively. Certainly we should vigorously prosecute welfare fraud but others do really need aid.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I believe the gas tax is still a viable way to fund roads and bridges- most vehicles still do use gas. I do think it needs to be updated, as it hasn't changed in years, even for inflation or reflecting greater mileage efficiency. The gas taxes should be funding more of the bill. Going forward chances are that electric or other energy means will increasingly power our vehicles. As that occurs we need to be reassessing our tax sources to ensure they stay relevant and fair.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes! We let a great opportunity with wind power get away a few years ago, but Maine still has abundant sources of wind, solar and tidal power available. We should be encouraging their development, which ultimately means investment, jobs and dollars in our state.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe that a woman has the right to choose what to do with her own body, and that includes terminating a pregnancy. I do not favor any law restricting this right.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
This addresses an issue of import to all of us- keeping seniors in our homes, which is also a more cost efficient solution than nursing homes. I am concerned about some of the details of this bill, including the funding mechanism and the regulatory body that it sets up. The funding source is the income above the limit taxed for Medicare. However, Congress is not stepping up to address that, so this remains uncaptured revenue. The regulatory issues can be addressed. I am voting yes.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. We did vote for it, so it is the people's will, and it is fair and allows greater choice. Some people are uncomfortable with it because it is ""new"", but as we learn that it works and works well I believe more people will embrace it. We do need to work to make the results quickly known. I believe that is critical to people's acceptance of it.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine needs to formulate a long range economic development strategy. We have high paying jobs available right now that are going unfilled because of the lack of a skilled workforce. This plan might include; job training for displaced and underemployed workers, state policies that attract and support legal immigrants to our state, enhanced career and technical educational offerings, targeted student debt relief and a focus on growing the small businesses central to our economy.
[image id=""2706599"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Maine Taxpayers are already paying for the uninsured. The legislature provided a mechanism to pay the portion that would leverage the 90% due from the Federal Government. All of the data now available seems to prove that states that expanded state Medicaid programs under the ACA, have lower rates of uninsured adults and lower costs overall for health care and insurance premiums for everyone. I believe we will see these benefits once the law is finally implemented.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform means ensuring the social service programs we have in place (food stamps, subsidized housing) are accessible for those who need help and part of a larger program that lifts families out of a life of poverty.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
State and federal gas taxes are insufficient to fund our infrastructure needs. Congress needs to take on this task and until they do, our best option is bonding. As a legislature, we need to work with our congressional delegation in formulating a long range plan to invest in our roads and bridges.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes, I believe renewable energy technologies have the potential to be an extremely viable sector of our economy and incentivizing these businesses helps us all. Renewable energy sources are a necessary part of any plan to address climate change.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I think women deserve to have all options available to them when deciding issues around their bodies and their health.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
While I agree that we need to do more to help seniors remain in their homes, I do not see Question 1 as the answer. Before we put in place a completely new framework and funding model for home care delivery services, we would be better served by properly evaluating and funding the agencies already in place. When the legislature does not do its job, you see questions like this appear on the ballot.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. I think the voters have been clear in their support for ranked choice voting and I respect that vote.
Pamela Buck (R)

House District 19: (Map) Sanford (part)
Matthew A. Harrington (R) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
There are a couple of barriers to economic development in Maine. We need to lower electricity costs, lower healthcare costs, reduce taxes, and address our labor shortage. We must embrace CTE and vocational education programs, and partner with our school systems through apprenticeship programs to ensure that students can be placed in employment situations. We also need to focus on growing our population, and recruiting people to raise live, work, and raise their families in our great state.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Voters passed the law and it is our responsibility as the Legislature to appropriate the funds. We need all stakeholders to gather around the table to talk about a responsible and sustainable funding mechanism for Medicaid expansion that does not include raising taxes, cutting funding for education, or raiding Maine's rainy day fund. We need a long-term funding solution so we do not end up with massive debts owed to Maine hospitals that resulted from the last expansion.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform means maintaining a strong safety net for our most vulnerable citizens including our elderly, disabled, children, and veterans. Welfare should be a hand up for those who have hit a bump in the road, not a permanent hand out. We must continue to require individuals who can work - to work, volunteer, or participate in training to acquire skills to get a job. We must make sure welfare dollars are not spent on gambling, cigarettes, alcohol, or other illicit activities.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Bonding can be an effective way to improve our infrastructure. However, it cannot be the only way we fund it. We must develop a long-term, strategic plan, to address our infrastructure shortfalls. In addition, we must also prioritize infrastructure in our state budget by cutting out the waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars. We need to identify redundancies in our state budget and work to eliminate them, ensuring tax dollars are spent as efficiently and effectively as possible.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Maine needs a comprehensive energy strategy. We need to stop picking winners and losers and embrace a wide range of energy technologies. If we want to continue to grow our economy, we must lower electricity costs. I support renewable energy technologies that lower costs, and protect our environment. I do not support broad-based government subsidies for technologies that are not commercially viable, and only increase costs for Maine families and small businesses.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro-life. However, Roe v. Wade is the law of the land and we all have to live under it. I support abortion being a choice in instances of rape, incest, and the life of the mother. I oppose the use of taxpayer money for abortions, and support common-sense measures like parental notification for minors. As science develops with regards to the viability of the fetus, we must continually assess our abortion laws and restrictions to ensure that we are protecting the sanctity of life.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I am adamantly opposed to Question 1. Many of our existing home-care workers don't event support this extreme initiative. We need to protect our senior and disabled citizens. However, we cannot continue to grow Maine's economy by dramatically increasing taxes. Outside billionaires cannot continue to come into Maine and pour money into these liberal referendum questions, and use Maine as their test site. We need referendum reform to ensure all Mainers are adequately represented.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. Ranked-choice voting is both expensive and confusing. These last primary election results show that the result under ranked-choice voting would not have been any different than using a plurality of the vote. Ranked-choice voting has serious constitutional implications, and is largely unsupported by our hardworking town clerks who are responsible for administering our elections.
Jeremy Mele (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
A lack of a protected workforce. Maine unemployment is down, yet we have a so many jobs that go unfilled. This is due to a lack of incentives for workers to come to Maine. We need to attract workers to Maine in order to fill jobs and spur economic development. The legislature can do that by working to guarantee healthcare for all, establishing a student loan forgiveness program to attract college graduates, and upholding the gains we have made for the minimum wage.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
I was disappointed when the governor vetoed the bipartisan funding bill for the Medicaid expansion. To my mind, using Funds for a Healthy Maine and a small portion of the surplus just made sense when we had a surplus of $175 million. Healthcare is a human right, and the legislature needs to guarantee that right for Mainers. I support the aforementioned funding pathway because working and low income Mainers are dying due to lack of healthcare, and the legislature needs to combat this.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
""Welfare reform"" is often code for ""ignoring the needs of the most vulnerable"". I don't think we should be in the practice of gutting important and necessary social services. Doing so would leave thousands of working Mainers without vital support systems. Instead of ""reforming"" welfare, we should be expanding social programs, like Medicare, to cover everyone.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Providing safe and efficient infrastructure is one of the most important jobs of the government. We need safe roads and bridges for the day to day operations of society, and it will be my priority to make sure that funding for such infrastructure is secured. Bonding should be an option for funding large-scale projects, but we also need to explore how other states have begun to fund infrastructure upkeep, learn from them, and apply best practices in our communities.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Climate change is real, it's happening now, and if we do not divest from fossil fuels and transition to clean energy in a prompt manner, we risk ecological destruction. That sounds apocalyptic, but we have seen the dangers of climate change from increased tropical storms just recently with Florence in North Carolina. If we don't incentivize the transition to clean energy, our coastal communities will be at serious risk from rising ocean levels and storms.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe that people have the right to autonomy over their own bodies. A man should not be making decisions over what a woman should or should not do with her body, and neither should the state be in the business of infringing on the bodily autonomy of its citizens. Abortion is an important part of healthcare for so many, and, in order to protect the health and autonomy of Maine women, I do not think the state should be restricting access to it.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
For. We all get old, and many of us become disabled. When we do, we deserve to receive the care we need, and we deserve to receive that care in a way that lets us stay in the homes we've worked hard to own. Question 1 will ensure that the elderly and the disabled, many of whom are veterans, can receive the care they need while lifting a financial burden off of working Mainers who might otherwise struggle to afford and/or find time out of their work schedules to care for their relatives in need.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I am supportive of Ranked-Choice Voting in general; I think it provides Mainers a more accurate way of voicing our opinion of who we think should represent us in the government. In this way, it is a boon to, and a refinement of, our democratic process. Furthermore, the voters of my district approved Ranked-Choice Voting in 2016 and again during this year's midterm. A representative needs to represent the will of the voters of their district.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The legislature needs fiscal responsibility. The tax burden on businesses are deterrents to new businesses coming to Maine. We need an energy plan to ensure viable, sustainable, affordable and reliable energy. Burdensome business regulations need to be relaxed. High Speed Internet throughout the state is a must. Education, K-12, CTE, Community College and University systems need to be streamlined and strengthened. We need to explore capital incentives for college students to stay in Maine.
[image id=""2708667"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Without a constitutional amendment requiring referendum bills to go to the Appropriations committee, the entire system is upside down. In order to fund this expansion, we must have a long-term sustainable funding source. I do not support raising taxes, using the state's rainy-day fund or spending gimmicks.
These able bodied, childless adults who will benefit, should have skin in the game; contributing to their own healthcare cost. If not, the health care costs will continue to rise.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare was intended to help those in need get back on their feet again, a hand-up, not a hand out. It was never intended to be a lifestyle. The 'T' in TANF stands for TEMPORARY. When people need help, this system is in place and designed to be a safety net. It was also intended to help those who are genuinely and permanently unable to care for themselves. Anything that falls outside of this should be subject to re-examination and should be re-tooled or reformed.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Constant borrowing is a problem and sets up our next generation to pick up the tab. We should revisit the means by which we fund our infrastructure.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Maine's energy exportation wholesale prices have been stable for years, however our price of transmission has increase 250% during the period. We should also continue the course of maintaining one of the nationally top cleanest energy producers.
Hidden fees raising the electric bills of all rate payers including low income and elderly Mainers is not acceptable. If people want solar panels on their house they're free to do so. State government should not force their neighbors to pay for it.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am not in favor of loosening access. Public funds should not be used for abortion access.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
No to Q1. Why was this bill denied a public hearing? What is being hidden?
The shadow-government board this bill proposes, will allow funds to flow through a publicly funded, unaccountable 9-person private, union-backed board, who will determine the spending of $300 million annual funds. Additionally, this board will have $15 million to spend on themselves. SERIOUSLY? The private information of individual state home care providers will be accessed without consent. This is unacceptable.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No, I do not support this. Ironically, the proponents of RCV seek a constitutional amendment. Yet they oppose a constitutional amendment requiring equal number of signatures from the First and Second Congressional District to allow a question to be on the ballot. Fixing the referendum process must come first. RCV cost this state an additional $300,000 above the costly projected budget. These schemes always cost more than projected. This is a highly irresponsible abuse of public funds.
Justin Reinhardt (G)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The biggest barrier is that the jobs dont pay what the cost of living here is. We need a workforce and the issue is quite simply no one can afford to work here.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
It's funny to me that no one asked this question when general dynamics was given a 45 million dollar tax break and fired 26 people afterwards. Id say walk back the tax breaks starting from there. 45 million buys a lot of healthcare.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Theft of the insurances we the public pay for, so that the oligarchs can get a bigger tax break on their private jets.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Absolutely. A publicly owned infrastructure program to include water power gas and broadband with a state run single payer healthcare system would be a good way to start. Lots of jobs investing in ourselves as opposed to letting private industry take control of our resources.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely becoming clean energy independent even as a state should always be a priority.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro choice, I wouldn't want someone making a decision for me and I would assume the same respect to anyone else.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
In favor of. Im a big fan of treating people with dignity and respect, in home care offers that to elderly mainers who mat have issues getting care they need.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Absolutely. The people have spoken and it is morally reprehensible that the legislature cant seem to honor the will of the people.
Kelcy McNamara (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The barriers to economic development differ for large and small businesses in Maine. A lack of workers is affecting businesses of all sizes. With our natural beauty and quality of life Maine is well positioned to attract an increasingly mobile workforce. We should be focused on building excellent public schools, reliable statewide broadband internet, and a state government that is effective, cooperative, and respectful of each other and its constituents.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The people of Maine, the state legislature, and Maine courts have all made it clear the Medicaid expansion is law and will be implemented. The funding is available, the long-term cost savings are clear, and it is the responsibility of the next Legislature and Governor to implement the roll-out without devolving into partisan fights and government shutdowns.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform priorities differ for Democrats and Republicans but share some of the same goals. Policies meant to help those in economic need should be both evidenced based and have the long-term interests of the state and it's economy in mind.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Low interest rates have made larger, much-needed investments in our infrastructure possible, but they are not long terms strategies. As cars become more fuel efficient and account for a decreasing amount of fuel tax, we need to consider new ways to fund our infrastructure that are both fair and cost effective.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The renewable energy sector is one of the fastest growing in the country and Maine. It is responsible for thousands of good paying jobs that cannot be exported. Renewable energy could become a critical new foundational economy for Maine that would have huge benefits for rural and suburban communities across the state. We should stop throwing up borders to renewable energy and should support it with reasonable, short-term investments which studies show offer excellent long-term returns.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe in a woman's right to choose and support policies that allow them to do so in a safe and healthy manner.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I believe we should do all we can to support seniors who want to age in place--their place--with dignity. I support and will work hard to accomplish the goal of Question 1 but am generally not for aggressive tax policy by referendum. In fact I think this highlights the importance of implementing the voter-approved Medicaid expansion.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Ranked Choice Voting achieves the same fair result that run-off elections used all over the country accomplish. But it does so in a more cost effective and timely way. If our governor and legislature were all elected by a majority, I think we would see far more civility and a lot more getting done in Augusta.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The state needs to provide the infrastructure that makes business work and the education that makes for a ready workforce. Broadband is essential for both business and education, making it an important part of needed infrastructure improvement.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Every dollar Maine spends on Medicaid expansion will be matched with $9 from the federal government, $9 that will be spent in Maine paying salaries and fees for services rendered in Maine, and re-spent by the medical staffs and businesses who receive the salaries and fees. If Maine can't recoup the investment through revenues generated by the infusion of money into the local economy, the state is doing something wrong.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I believe there is a mistaken perception that there is an epidemic of professional welfare recipients. Despite a unemployment rate under 3%, nearly a third of Mainers don't make enough to meet monthly bills. Welfare recipients aren't generally able-bodied individuals who refuse to work, they are under-employed or under-paid workers. We need welfare not because people are lazy but because capitalists are greedy and exploit workers such that a job often doesn't provide enough income to get by.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
No.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The state should not subsidize private industry, but should take part in developing clean energy technologies for Maine and reducing Mainers' dependence upon fossil fuels.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
No.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting ""yes"" on Question 1 because I believe we should help seniors live in their homes for as long as they want, both for the happiness of the people and because in-home care is generally less expensive than alternatives.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I support Ranked Choice Voting because it has the potential to reduce the domination of the two-party system and because the results will be more reflective of what a majority of the people want.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The biggest barrier to economic development in Maine is the lack of enough trained workers in specific fields like health care and skilled trades. The Legislature can encourage and should provide incentives for reducing costs for college/workforce training and student loan forgiveness.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Full implementation and funding Medicaid expansion will be a top priority of mine. The Legislature and next administration need to honor the will of the voters.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare should be a program to help people get through unforeseen circumstances whether it is a lack of housing, food, clothing, or a job. Current programs should be evaluated to see if and where changes could/need to be made. We need to work with welfare recipients so they can get back on their feet whether that means providing education/job retraining, child care services, health care, or food/shelter.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes. This needs to be done with input from experts in the field and look at what other states have done to change their infrastructure funding. The state gas tax has not been increased since 2011 and a modest increase could be part of the overall plan. State gas tax rates should be evaluated annually and go back to being indexed to the rate of inflation. There are many electric and hybrid cars on our roads now and there should be a way to access a road usage fee for them.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes, incentives for renewable energy technologies should be expanded. We need to rely less on fossil fuel based technologies because of the impact on our climate and environment.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Women's health decisions should be between a woman and her doctor. All women need appropriate access to healthcare regardless of income and geographic location
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Although Maine needs to do a better job at supporting senior citizens in their homes and it is significantly cheaper to help them in their homes instead of placing them in facilities, I am concerned about making tax policies via referendum. I will be voting against Question 1.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. The people of Maine passed the referendum and the constitution should reflect that. Ranked choice voting is a way to build consensus for a candidate instead of a candidate winning who is not supported by the majority of Maine voters.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The biggest barrier to economic development in our state is not one issue, but instead the way we govern. Instead of thinking in two-year increments, we need to think long-range, and develop economic plans that look ten, twenty, and thirty years out. For too long the legislature has taken a spitball approach to economic development. We need to develop long term policies that integrate all areas of our economy into a plan to sustainably grow our economy.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Maine voters overwhelmingly approved Medicaid expansion, and we owe it to the 70,000 Mainers who would benefit to immediately implement the new law. Depending on the federal government match, we should incorporate any necessary funding into the state budget. It may come at a cost to other programs, but any increase in funding should be done through the budget process.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Social service programs are a critical lifeline for many Mainers; however, there are reforms we can undertake to make the system work even better. Unfortunately, these reforms have been hindered by those who have turned reform into a political issue. Good people on both sides should come together to work on the reforms that will promote work, encourage individual responsibility, and ensure that those among us who need help are able to get that help.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Every year, the DOT says we need $160 million more to keep up with basic maintenance. This is unacceptable. If there's anything government is responsible for, it's to ensure Maine people and businesses have safe roads and bridges. During my six years in the Legislature, I have submitted bipartisan bills to try and solve this issue. While bonds play a role in funding infrastructure, we must identify sustainable, predictable funding that doesn't rely on borrowing to ensure the system's longevity.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. While we must still invest in traditional sources of energy, such as natural gas, we must begin investing in clean renewable energies. Not only is it good for our air and water, it also creates good paying jobs. From research and development to construction, a clean renewable energy sector could yield thousands of new jobs, particularly in areas of Maine that are in need of new jobs.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
The issue of abortion is a difficult one for many people; however, it is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution, and should remain so. The only people making decisions about this procedure should be a woman and her doctor and, in that light, we should be enacting legislation to ensure that any woman who elects to have an abortion is doing so fully-informed and in a safe facility. We do not need laws that make it harder for women to have an abortion.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
The goal of ensuring that our elderly get the care they deserve is an important one. However, I believe that tax policy should generally be set by the legislature because it provides an opportunity to amend bills before they get enacted into law. The best tax legislation gets written when many people have the opportunity to have input, and that is not the case with this referendum. The legislature should take up this important issue when it returns in January.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. Maine people twice voted to support ranked choice voting, even after the legislature voted to repeal the law. Genuine questions of constitutionality arose during the campaign; however voters chose to enact-and then keep-this new way of voting. We should ensure that the system for which they voted gets used in the gubernatorial and state legislative races. The legislature should send a constitutional amendment out to the people for ratification.
Roger E. Densmore III (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
High taxes...however, within the last several years, Maine has seen a slight decrease in the income tax. At the same time, Maine has been experiencing some of the lowest unemployment rates in years. The flip side to this is, is businesses have been unable to find and hire capable/skilled employees. There are many Maine businesses that are losing out on millions of dollar's worth of new work because they are unable to hire workers who are skilled in the appropriate trades.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
My understanding is that normally bills passed by the legislature send funding requests to the appropriations committee to see how it fits into the budget. When the Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion, it was done without a long-term, sustainable funding source that does not raise taxes or deplete Maine's rainy-day fund. It took the Governor many years to pay back the hospitals and get Maine out of the debt from the last Medicaid expansion, we must learn from this history.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare Reform to me should be an ongoing effort. We should make sure those who need the social service programs have full access to them while those who are using them as a manner of convenience do not. Those who are able to work and choose not to are just taking away valuable resources from those in need while taking hardworking tax dollars. Numerous welfare reform proposals have been submitted by Republicans and rejected by Democrats on how individuals can use the money ie alcohol, tobacco
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I feel if the revenue generated by each towns vehicle registration excise tax was used the way it was intended, rather that put into a general fund used to fund other shortfalls in the towns budgets, along with toll revenue, there would be plenty of funding for Maine roads and bridges. If there continued to be revenue shortfalls for what was needed, I'd prefer an increase in tolls at he border so visitors to the State would fund a majority of infrastructure/transportation repairs.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
We should not be subsidizing any energy resources or any renewal technologies, if it means raising electric bills or taxes on Maine residents to fund it.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro-life. I believe in the sanctity of human life, from conception to natural death. I support prohibiting the use of state funds for abortion or activities that run counter to the sanctity of human life.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting no on Question 1, as it will impose massive tax increases on already overtaxed Maine families and businesses. It will undermine programs for the poor and funding would be open to everyone, regardless of income. The referendum process has been hijacked by out of state money that does not have Mainers best interest in mind. The unelected and unaccountable committee will have upwards of 300 million dollars worth of taxpayers money to do whatever they want with.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I do not support amending the constitution to allow ranked-choice voting. I believe in 1 person, 1 vote. Ranked-choice voting is not only a waste of time, it is a waste of tax payer's money. We should be focused on ways to improve the referendum process.

Karen Vachon (R) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Workforce shortages because baby boomers retiring, people dying of drug overdose, high taxes and high energy prices. We need to get our young people suffering from addiction into treatment. We need to incentivize young talented people to settle in Maine; with an emphasis on bringing Maine bred children who left the state �"" back to Maine. At the same time, promote a proud Maine brand that young children growing up here, never want to leave.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
First �"" no question should be allowed to go to citizen referendum without a price tag and a method to pay for it. People don't like to go to restaurants that don't put the price on the menu; citizen referendums should not be absent a price tag either. Second �"" healthcare is very complex, and is something every Mainer needs. A two-sentence referendum question with no price tag is a completely irresponsible way to introduce healthcare policy.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We must provide safety nets for our most needy, debilitated, intellectually challenged people who cannot care for themselves. Welfare should not be a way of life. People falling on hard times, should be extended temporary assistance with a hand up; rather than forever reliant on a hand out. Welfare programs should incorporate work, volunteer, or continuing education elements, with an emphasis that supports community engagement, self-sufficiency, productivity, and financial independence.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Our roads and bridges are crumbling. All vehicles who use the roads, should pay. Increasing the gas tax and usage fees for electric vehicles are ways to increase revenue.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
No. Already, Maine produces 40% more energy than it uses. I don't support subsidies. There is an appetite for renewable energy by consumers �"" we should let the free market invest in this technology in a fair and sustainable way. Renewable energy needs to compete and stand on its own merit. Maine should put pressure on Massachusetts to expand the pipelines for low cost natural gas. Maine should not expand wind to benefit Massachusetts.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. It's ironic that PITA wanted to erect a monument to honor the death of a truck load of lobsters. It's ironic that we go to great lengths to protect our piping plover population. But we don't protect the life of an unborn human being. In our efforts to protect our environment, why aren't we protecting the highest form of life: human life? There's a disconnect.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
No. A 3.8% increase in income tax to people earning $128,400/year is a bad idea. It will send high wage earners out of state; it will deter high wage earners from moving to Maine. It will attract more aging seniors to our state. The US Department of Health & Human Services estimates that 70% of seniors over age 65 will need long term care services. The revenue raised from this tax, will no be enough to provide the care it promises. Addressing healthcare and opioid epidemic take priority.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. I support the current plurality voting system. It is clear and easy for everyone to understand and participate: the person with the most votes wins. Why over complicate voting? It confuses the voter, costs more, and takes longer to determine the results.
Shawn A. Babine (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
POVERTY! For the last eight years we've been living through a war on poor people, when we should be waging war on the issues that cause poverty. Increased funding for education, Medicaid expansion and improved access to healthcare, investments in workforce planning and skilled training programs - those are the fights worth fighting for. Education is the ladder that helps every Mainer out of poverty.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
There wasn't a lack of funding - the Maine Legislature identified a funding source. Medicaid expansion didn't happen because of a lack of respect for the Maine people by the LePage administration and a lack of leadership from the House republicans.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The fact is general assistance (e.g. welfare) is needed for very diverse reasons while """"welfare reform"""" is a goal of reducing the number of individuals dependent on government assistance; hopefully by keeping the welfare system affordable and by providing resources that give each recipient the opportunity to become self sufficient. It's time we stop the current war on poor people and start finding solutions on what causes poverty.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
This is a complex issue that I am not familiar with yet and would need more information in order to provide a specific response.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Most renewable energy investments are spent on materials and workmanship to build and maintain the facilities, rather than on costly energy imports. Renewable energy investments are spent within the same state, and often in the same town. This means our energy dollars stay home to create high paying skilled jobs (jobs that a new generation of highly skilled young workers are leaving our state for) and fuel local economies, rather than going overseas.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
A woman has the right to an abortion, and no government, law or person should interfere with her exercising her rights.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I believe how a citizen votes in the ballot box is private and personal even if they are a legislator. I will share I am somewhat undecided. I believe the intent of the citizen initiative is admirable and with the failure of the legislature to override the Governor's veto of medicaid expansion further supports why this is so needed. I am concerned about creating another dysfunctional oversight agency within DHHS, when the solution is universal healthcare and medicare for all.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
As a Legislator I would support a constitutional amendment; Maine voters have been very clear - they want ranked-choice voting.
House District 30: (Map) Cape Elizabeth (part)
Anne M. Carney (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine has strong economic potential, but we're limited by workforce and skilled labor shortages. The Legislature can encourage business growth by adequately funding the technical and community colleges that train Mainers and build the workforce our economy needs. Our agriculture and forestry industries would similarly benefit from additional resources being directed toward U Maine, to support research centers and educational programs that bring growth and innovation to Maine's economy.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Let's put the question into perspective. Mainers' federal taxes currently fund Medicaid expansion in 32 other states. With expansion, Maine will see over $500 million in federal funds per year, and the creation of over 5,000 health care jobs. Maine can initially fund our 10% share of the program from the Fund for a Healthy Maine. Thereafter, the Legislature will fund expansion using the normal appropriations process. We only pay 10% to receive $500 million annually, so I consider it a priority.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I don't like to use the term ""welfare reform;"" it's stigmatizing toward people who participate in publicly-funded programs. Additionally, each of these programs stands on its own two feet, and should be evaluated according to the benefits it provides. If a program doesn't achieve its intended purpose, the Legislature should improve it - but I don't consider that ""welfare reform."" I consider it good governance and smart use of tax dollars.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Maine should rethink how we fund transportation. We all benefit from the transportation infrastructure, but gas tax is most burdensome to people in rural communities. And the system isn't sustainable - as we improve fuel efficiency to protect the environment, the money available for infrastructure dwindles. Maine should consider combining the current fuel-based system with a per-vehicle tax based on value. This both increases funding and more fairly balances the cost of maintaining our roads.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Keeping current incentives, like net metering, is fair to homeowners and businesses that have already invested in renewable energy. By modernizing our laws to allow larger cost-effective community solar projects, we can save Mainers money while protecting the environment. These incentives don't impact the state budget, and growing Maine's renewable energy sector creates jobs all over the state. We should spend our energy dollars in Maine, on Mainers, rather than send that money out of state.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Americans have a constitutional right to safe, legal abortion care - but this right is not accessible to all. A person's ability to obtain an abortion often depends on factors like where they live and their financial resources. I support laws that help Mainers overcome these barriers, and oppose laws that create new ones. For example, I would support amending Maine law to allow licensed and qualified physician assistants and advanced practice registered nurses to provide medication abortion.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
After much research and thought, I'll vote against Question 1. It provides benefits to people who can afford to pay for home-care themselves. Meanwhile, Mainers in need could be denied benefits if funds are used up. And Question 1 double-taxes some families, because the 3.8% is based on family income while social security tax applies to individual income. Question 1 is really nine pages of complex changes to Maine's Health and Tax laws that, to me, don't add up to an effective benefit program.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. Maine voters have twice spoken loudly on this issue, and it is clear that they want ranked-choice voting. As a legislator, my role would be to represent my constituents' interests, and I strongly support a constitutional amendment to allow ranked-choice voting in Maine's general elections.

Lois Galgay Reckitt (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Workforce shortages and the necessity for specialized training. Training initiatives are particularly important for people emigrating to Maine whose credentials may not be entirely compatible without changes in current requirements or updates through training.
In addition, workers laid off from Maine's Forest Products Industries may need similar training and updates to adapt to different job opportunities. The Community College System should be leading the way on this issue.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We need a new Governor who will not repeatedly stymie both Legislative and citizen efforts in this area.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Providing family supports, child care initiatives, education and training opportunities could eliminate the subsidies currently required by many in Maine. Those are some of the ""welfare reforms"" that are needed.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
For one thing, we need to put the bonds that have already been approved on the market! But further, we need a graduated, strategic and comprehensive plan for all aspects of our declining infrastructure...and get to it. And that plan needs to be done in a statewide and comprehensive way.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely, the future of both Maine and the planet depend on it.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Public and insurance based funding should be available for all who choose to make this difficult decision.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I am not yet sure. I understand the necessity of home based care as well as the need for public/governmental subsidies. However, the devil is in the details and I have not yet studied them. I am however sure that if the Question passes, the Legislature may well change/try to fix it if they feel that needs to happen.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Absolutely. I have supported the process even before it was an issue in Maine. I have run elections with 3000+ participants in the national nonprofit sector and have watched it both work to give all participants a meaningful voice - and decrease rancor.

Christopher Kessler (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Our economic system has created an environment where the cost of health care, housing and education has risen out of control. Relieving the cost burden of these needs will free up resources to be spent on expanding and strengthening our economy. This requires a fairer tax system that requires the wealthy to contribute more.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
There is funding from the recent tobacco settlement fund to pay for the initial outlay, and then should come from the General Fund afterward.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
""Welfare Reform"" to me is a term used by people that wish to cut benefits and services from those who need them. To me, it is a loaded phrase that implies that there is something wrong with our welfare system.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I do not believe a gas tax is an outdated way of funding transportation.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely. It is a matter of economic and energy security: Maine is the most oil-dependent state in the nation. We must also do our part to lessen the impact of human activity on the climate.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
No.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I am voting for Question 1. The initiative addresses one of the most pressing needs in our society: providing basic care to our elders in the oldest state in the nation. Paying for this care is out of reach for many families. A 3.8% tax on individual income above $128,400 is reasonable, in my opinion. I see it as a step toward eventually providing universal health care to all Maine residents.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Absolutely. Ranked-choice voting is a better way to do elections, eliminating ""spoiler candidates"" and truly having an accurate pulse on the sentiment of the voters. It has been proven to work worldwide and has shown to work well in Maine thus far.

Victoria Morales (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine lacks vision and planning. As one of the oldest states with our young people leaving for opportunities in other states, we need strong leadership to change that narrative. I will work with the private, public, and nonprofit sectors to invest in workforce training, public pre-k and schools, student loan relief, and to support small businesses. As a parent of three children, ages 8, 12, and 14, and a small business owner, this issue is extremely important to me.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Yes, funding concerns should be addressed, however the program comes almost fully funded. The Medicaid expansion program offers Maine the opportunity to provide health care to 70,000 low income Mainers at only 10% of the cost of the program. This means for every dollar spent, the federal government pays 90 cents. This is an incredible financial investment considering the benefits to Maine people and the economy, including a healthier workforce and new health care jobs.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The term welfare reform unfairly paints folks in need of this temporary safety net as lazy. I was fortunate to have a family safety net to help with my college tuition. But for so many, these family safety nets do not exist. Consistent with my belief that government's role is to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of its people, providing people temporary support to make a better life for themselves and their children is not only the right thing to do, it is also good for our economy.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, as a former MeDOT employee, I am intimately aware of the challenges to maintain and keep safe our over 8,000 miles of roads and bridges. We fund projects with vehicle fees and taxes, federal funds, and bonds. Bonds leverage federal funds and spread the infrastructure cost over many generations. As the demand for alternative fuel vehicles and transit increases, I am interested in exploring user fees and other sources to fund infrastructure improvements.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes, Maine should expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technology. Once the political will is favorable and we have a renewable energy policy, I am optimistic that we will see an influx of new projects and jobs in this area, as well as partnerships with the private sector to expand services such as broadband to rural Maine along with each new project. Furthermore, adding more competition into the energy and utility sector will create a healthier and more balanced market.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe that medical decisions should be made by women and their medical professionals. The global data on this issue is clear. For countries that remove barriers to contraception and abortion, the abortion rates drop significantly. For countries that restrict access, abortion rates rise. For these reasons, I support loosening restrictions to contraception and abortion.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
The wording of the ballot question indicates that the 3.8% income tax increase to support the home care program will apply to individuals and families meeting the income threshold. While I support the intent behind the referendum, I am very concerned about funding the program with a tax increase on middle class families. If this initiative does not pass, I am interested in keeping this discussion going to find other funding solutions to the home care problems.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. I support RCV because it is an efficient election process that allows for more voices to be heard. Moreover, RCV reduces the need for costly run-off elections and candidates being elected with less than 50% of the vote. Maine voters have expressed strong support for RCV and the legislature should move forward with a constitutional amendment.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Infrastructure including the electrical grid ( 3 phase power) and high speed internet.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Funding has been identified by the democratic legislators but blocked by the Executive.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
S**ew you, Jack! I've got mine!
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Sooner rather than later! Vehicle Miles Traveled is one option that brings us back to the philosophy that ""user fees"" paid by ""users"" should pay for upkeep!
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. It's going to happen inevitably so we would be wise to be ahead of the curve!
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Laws around abortion access should be left the heck alone!
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Sad to say, against. I've been a caregiver so I really do understand the need, I just don't think this solution has been well thought out.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes! Here we go again this year with the risk of having good candidates turned into spoilers.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The biggest barrier to economic development in Maine is our failure to provide appropriate education and training in the knowledge and skills that entrepreneurs need to grow small businesses and that employees need to obtain good jobs. The Legislature would do well to expand workforce training programs, especially those aimed at recipients of social services, and increase free and low-cost online learning programs through the University of Maine System and regional vocational schools.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Since Maine citizens approved Medicaid expansion the Legislature must implement the voters' will and provide funding through the general budget. A first source of funding would be any savings that can be achieved by streamlining other state programs. If necessary, additional tax revenue could be raised from the wealthiest residents of the state. The state should limit Medicaid expenditures by working to improve economic conditions to help citizens afford to pay for their own health care.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We need to reform social service programs so that they are successful in transitioning most people off of dependence on state assistance, rather than serving as a permanent source of income, housing and food, as they are for many people. There are some members of society who, because of mental illness or other disability, require public assistance on a permanent basis, but many more would be well served by programs that require them to work in exchange for the public benefits that they receive.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Maine should become a leader in the nation and world by implementing significant carbon taxes which would create incentives for reducing carbon emissions and changing people's behavior. Roads and bridges should be paid for primarily through state and federal taxes on the gasoline used to power the vehicles that use them. Rather than pay more interest on transportation bonds Maine would do well to increase investment on infrastructure in the general budget.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The state should expand incentives to encourage appropriate renewable energy technologies, especially solar power. Because solar power does not generate carbon dioxide emissions or other air pollution, it has fewer negative externalities -- costs passed on to society and the environment -- than burning of fossil fuels. Most importantly, the state should invest in energy conservation programs and education, and we should learn to change our habits and consume far less energy than we do now.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
The life of a girl with distinct genes from her mother begins when a sperm cell fertilizes an egg and her gender is determined. A boy's heartbeat can be detected within seven weeks of development within his mother's womb. A fetus is not a part of a woman's body, it is a unique human being inside a woman's body. I support mandatory sonograms and 24-hour waiting periods for women seeking abortions in the hope that these requirements will help them decide not to end their children's lives.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will vote against Question 1 because this type of decision should be made by the Legislature, not through a referendum. 3.8 percent of the income of a large number of Maine residents is too great a portion of revenue to be specifically earmarked for the single purpose of home care. Households with a combined income of over $128,400 are not necessarily wealthy enough to afford this much additional taxation if they include two wage earners with children.

8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I support a constitutional amendment allowing ranked choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections because it would enable citizens to vote for the candidate they most support without fearing that they would be inadvertently helping the candidate they most oppose. Ranked choice voting would help candidates from outside the two major parties win election to public office as many independent and third-party candidates would be the second choice of Democrats and Republicans.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The biggest barrier is the inability for regular Mainers to have access to the startup capital and expertise to start and maintain new, small business. The Legislature can implement the strategy recommendations proposed last year to the Committee on Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The funding in the short term already exists. It also exists in the long term if we chose to make healthcare for Mainers a priority.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Usually, Welfare Reform means denying help to someone trying to get it to make short term political gains. True Welfare Reform would focus on long-term goals of truly moving people back into the work force and not merely claiming victory when we send them off to fend for themselves and the rolls shrink as a result.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes. Infrastructure is a necessity for the success of the state. Like so many things, we leave improvements to municipalities or to another day. We need to improve our ability to move people and products In energy efficient ways.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. We could be the producers of this technology but instead we coddle the fossil fuel industry to maintain the status quo. We could be leaders in these industries but we choose to bicker about whether to follow.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am satisfied with the laws as they exist.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Workers in the home are industry can not afford to hold these jobs. As question 1 will give them a raise, create entry level jobs statewide and take care of the elderly, I will vote for it.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. I'm pretty sure the people have spoken twice on this. I don't believe that I am smarter then the voters.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
By far the most important economic development issue facing Maine is the aging population, which is starting (and will continue) to have a profound effect on the workforce. We need to: (1) Keep the state's vocational and higher ed systems vital and affordable and attractive to students from outside Maine (2) Work to support immigrant new Mainers and get this educated and qualified population assimilated and into the workforce; (3) Create an artciulated economic development plan for the State.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The funds are available now and they have been made available in the past. I am certainly not opposed to tapping a new dedicated source of revenue to pay for Medicare, but to say that the funding has not been provided is simply inaccurate. For this and other challenges facing the state we need to start returning to a process whereby the executive and legislative branches actually collaborate.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We want to assure that these funds are going to to support people who need them, and if fraud exists it should be prosecuted. Most studies, however, show that levels of fraud are wildly overstated. ""Welfare reform"" is, in general, a code term for adding barriers, providing less support for the poor or finding ways for private companies to make money providing government services. I want to see welfare programs (and Medicaid is not welfare) run by the state, efficiently, fairly, transparently.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Maine's fuel tax has failed to keep up with the cost of roads, so in recent years that revenue has been increasingly augmented by bonds. Bonding for this ongoing purpose uses resources that could otherwise be used for urgent non-road, capital projects. We should have raised the fuel tax when the price of gas was extremely low a few years ago and it would not have been painful. We still should still do this and consider indexing the tax. Tolls are only paid by road users. I like those too.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The failure of the state to assure the growth and success of the renewable energy sphere, especially solar, has been my biggest disappointment in six years. Maine should ""lay the table"" for growth in solar and other alternative energies. That said, alternatives are not enough, and we need to assure that conventionally-generated energy remains available in the amounts needed to provide backup for alternatives. We also need to provide better incentives for conservation.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I do not support changes in any of the laws relating to abortion access in Maine. I think health care decisions should be made solely and exclusively by patients, in consultation with their health care providers. I also think that better access to public health and heath education (around contraception and STD prevention) will reduce the need for abortion and other medical interventions in the first place.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against. I am not sure why home care, which is admittedly important, rises above all other important issues for the state. I don't support having a special tax to fund only home care that would give Maine one of the highest top marginal tax rates in the country. In general I would support adjusting, modernizing and broadening the tax code, maybe adding a bracket. But I want to see Maine ""in the pack"" of states, with regard to tax burden, as opposed to being at the top. I don't support surtaxes.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
The citizens voted clearly to adopt ranked-choice voting, and such an amendment is necessary to make this voting method constitutionally workable for all state offices, so I would support such amendment in order to realize the intent of the voters.

Benjamin T Collings (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Oldest, whitest state in the U.S. Most of Maine with stagnant economy for years. More training for skilled labor, encourage immigrants and refugees to move here for unfilled jobs and have children for future workforce. Invest in broadband, roads, bridges.Free community colleges and two years of free University. Invest in early childhood and K-12 education for a more prepared workforce. Alternative energy economy. More assistance for small businesses to expand. Ecotourism investment.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We already have the money available to get things going today and revenue forecasting indicates we will have money going forward to fund this. The federal government will pick up almost the entire cost, it would be ill advised from an economic and moral standpoint to refuse the federal money and not invest the modest amount that we already have available to fund the program.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
If we have true welfare reform, we should look at corporate welfare as well. True well reform also starts with guaranteed health care, affordable housing and a living wage. Without that, many working people will be forced to take public assistance.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes. Also need to invest in more public transportation like rail, we need to plan for the future. I need to study more before advising on mileage tax and other financing strategy.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Reduce carbon footprint and provide long term efficiencies. Look at a state like VT, you see solar frequently off the highway. No reason we can't do the same. Solar prices have come way down over the years. Benchmarks for alternative energy could also provide new jobs throughout the state.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Government should not interfere with the decisions of a woman and her doctor.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
As I support the concept, I am leaning towards supporting the initiative. Like many of these referendums with good intent, the language may have some flaws. In the Legislature we would have to make sure certain aspects are taken care of like individual not combined household income are taxed. It would be a lot of work to fix if is passed, but regardless, we have to do something. Taking care of our Elders is one of the biggest challenges we face and we can't kick the can down the road any further
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I publicly supported the referendum for RCV and voted for full implementation in the last session. I believe in a majority of votes, not a plurality. Don't see Republicans every joining Democrats to deliver a 2/3 vote to amend anytime in the near future.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Have an educated workforce. Work with Community Colleges and UMaine System to provide the education and skills building for current and future needs of Maine.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Should be included in all budgets going forward.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We must look for ways to effectively give services to those in need.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, solutions could include a small increase in the gas tax, looking at the possibility of increasing gas tax during high tourism months in Maine.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes, renewables energy technologies not only address the issue of climate change, but also can be job creators right here in the state.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
We must protect a women's right to choose.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against. This is a worthy initiative, but the incorrect funding model.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, the people have spoken and we should work toward that goal.
Sarah Sandlin (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine's graying population. For Mainers of all ages to thrive, we must retain and attract young people to build careers and raise families in Maine. To achieve this, we must make Maine an affordable place to live and do business in by reducing taxes and eliminating unnecessary regulations.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We need a budgeting process that funds key priorities first - including our obligations for healthcare, education, and public safety. We need to build trust on both sides of the aisle so that we are working from a common set of facts and estimates. Through increases in communication and trust we can work to fund our priorities.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We need to empower people to be the best version of themselves. The state should encourage TANF recipients to thrive independently by imposing work search requirements.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
We need to ensure that the economic activity generated by updates to infrastructure pays back interest by targeting bonds to programs that work, are efficient and have economic value to them.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes, the renewable energy sector has incredible potential for economic development. Expansion and innovation within this industry also goes hand-in-hand with preserving Maine's natural beauty for generations to come.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I support women's reproductive freedom. We must protect these rights in the interest of women's safety and privacy. Women's well-being and freedom is inextricable from the ease of accessibility to these services.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
No. We can't get people to stay here if we continue to do things to make them go. Who the tax policy is defining as a ""wealthy"" would be considered middle-class anywhere else in the country. To think that something so far-sweeping could appear on the ballot - without any type of strategic long-term plan attached - underscores the need for reform of the referendum process.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I support efforts to make the voting process more democratic. That being said, we have yet to see whether changing our constitution truly empowers people to vote their conscious.

Dale Denno (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Our biggest economic challenge is having the skilled workforce to enable entrepreneurs to start and to grow their businesses. We need to encourage young people to stay in Maine, and attract people to move here. That includes college debt relief. Low-income families need health care and nutrition so that they and their children can become productive citizens. We also need to support the integration of immigrants, the disabled and the elderly into the workforce.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Medicaid expansion is not up for debate; it is the law of the land. The Legislature passed a bill to fund expansion, which the Governor vetoed. Every dollar Maine spends on expansion will bring $9 into the state, funding thousands of jobs and taking enormous economic pressure off of struggling hospitals. Maine's current revenue projections show we can fund expansion without new taxes. Many Republican governors have done the math and realized that expansion is a good deal for the states.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
As a former Director of Maine's public assistance programs, I believe that we should start with the principle that work and independence are important to all Mainers. Every person who can work should get the support and training to find a job. Persons with obstacles to working, such as substance abuse issues, should have those issues directly addressed. Our goal should be to support families to become independent, and to enable them to raise healthy children who can become productive citizens.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, our current approach to funding infrastructure through gas taxes is becoming increasingly outmoded as energy technology advances. To the extent that we want to pass the costs of infrastructure on to the users, we need to evolve more sophisticated means to measure user impacts. Weight and mileage of vehicles, for example, might be a better proxy for user impact than gas usage.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The critical threshold question is whether we accept the scientific findings of global climate change. Not only are fossil fuels an increasingly depleted energy source, but their use is contributing to the destruction of the planet. It is irresponsible for Maine not to support investment in all renewable energy sources. Maine trails far behind every other New England state in supporting renewable energy investment. It's time for Maine to take steps to become energy independent.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I do not favor changing current law. What we do know is that there always have been abortions. The only question is whether they should be safe and legal, or whether they should be driven underground. Abortions are becoming rarer with the wide availability of contraception, and that is a positive trend. Everyone can have their own beliefs about the issue, guiding their own actions. But no one, woman or man, should have politicians telling them what they can and cannot do with their own bodies.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting no on Question 1, but not because I don't agree on the critical need for better pay for direct care providers. We are not paying enough to the people we count on to take care of the elderly and disabled, with the result that people in need are not getting the services to which they are entitled by law. My objection to Question 1 is that I feel strongly that drafting tax laws is a complex legislative process, requiring careful consideration of all of the impacts and incentives.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, I support taking the actions that comply with the express will of the voters. When ranked-choice voting was before the voters, the constitutional question was unresolved. But it is very clear what the voters intended, and amending the constitution would simply be acting to carry out the will of the people of Maine. Disregarding the stated will of the people is, to my thinking, a very unfortunate recent trend in the Legislature.

Paul B. Chace (R) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Uncontrolled spending and tax burden on business. It is hard to do business, and extremely hard to expand. People from away come with more money than the average native can spend, and expectations of urban utilities and lifestyles in rural areas is expensive. Business opportunity is greater elsewhere, our kids will follow the jobs. We have to let businesses operate, that's what creates jobs. More jobs means more tax payers. Retirees lose money staying in Maine. Freeze taxes until sale.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Maine voters were told they were expanding healthcare, not Medicaid. Ask anyone if they thought they were voting for healthcare or increased welfare, you will find many believe that it was a healthcare bill. Having operated businesses through these expansions, Medicaid expansion does not foster personal growth or opportunity. I suggest we put tapered benefits tied to work experience, and as salary and benefits grow, state assistance disappears in a sliding scale. Instead we slide backwards.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
As I previously touched on - adding work incentives and benefits that taper allowing freedom from welfare. Currently there is little incentive for a Medicaid recipient to work, and may actually cost them to take an entry level job. There are many good paying jobs available. Adding a work requirement will help folks upward. Those that medically just can't, and that is what Medicaid is for, not able bodied single adults between the age of 18 and 59 which Medicaid expansion provides benefits.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I believe that continually bonding for transportation funding is inadequate, and should be in the state budget. Do we need all of the administration in both the Maine Turnpike Authority AND the Department of Transportation? The administration side has expanded, and the toll roads now support that administration instead of being the surplus money we saw years ago. Align the two, streamline, and put transportation in the state budget. Use tolls for entering the state.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
No. The Federal rebates are very good, costs for renewable energy sources are coming down because with any free market model, supply and desire will lower prices for renewable energy products. Solar fixed costs have dropped several fold percent in the past 10 years, and will continue to do so. Incentivize these companies and their employees through business tax reform and income tax reform so that the business remains competitive and viable as a free standing business venture.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
The proverbial third rail question. The definition of loosening and restricting can be wide and variable. Access from the standpoint of ability for one to go to a clinic, I believe is not restricted. So then is loosening access mean providing tax payer money to PAY for services? I don't believe I should spend other people's money on something they did not choose. IF you buy alcohol, you pay an alcohol tax. No one else pays it. Same with cigarettes.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against. If folks want the social security tax percentage continually withheld beyond the limits of what they can receive in social security benefit at retirement. The social security withholdings stop at $128,000 income because they will never receive a benefit commensurate with their contribution as lower income workers do. Like highway spending, it should be in the budget, not on the backs of hard working Mainers.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?No. I vote for my best candidate. I don't even want to think about second or third place, because my research and preferences are to chose one person. If my choice loses, then so be it. IF I have to do further analysis after that I will, but it should be in a run off where I can apply more focus to the next choices. I am not prepared to list 1,2,3, and in many cases, may not even want 2 or 3. Ranking creates a way for a non popular candidate to get in. Where is the logic in that?

[image id=""2708670"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
There is enough money available to use the normal budget process. Dedicated funds are LePage's excuse for inaction
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Historically, monetary support for families with children. Now used by Rs to apply to any social service aiding low income Mainers to stigmatize the program and its benificiaries.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Combination of bonds and higher gas tax, which is fair because reflects usage of roads, and reasonable because gas prices are down significantly since last change in rate.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Effect on climate change and creation of good jobs. Maine is far behind the other New England states in renewable jobs per capita.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Remove restrictions that have been added since Roe v. Wade.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Yes, but with the caveat that if enacted, the legislature should make changes to funding source, accountability, eligibility requirements and add a means test. If voters approve the measure, it will force the legislature to take up this neglected need.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, that is what the people voted for.
Dennis Ward Welsh (U)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
First barrier-taxes. Referendums that push for more taxes on working Mainers - the economic drivers of our communities and employers that hire Maine workers. Second-uncertainty. It's difficult for business leaders to plan for the future based on the climate in Augusta. Put people ahead of partisanship that is stifling Augusta. We must create an environment where start-ups want to plant their flags here. Fair taxes, a strong workforce, great education and a healthy environment in which to live.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
I believe that once Medicaid expansion is enacted in Maine, many of the funding concerns will self-correct and here's why - less emergency room visits, better access to healthcare for those most vulnerable, more stable and predictable hospital systems, lower healthcare costs and increased economic grown through an increase in nearly six thousand new jobs. This is an overall net gain for all of the people of Maine.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I truly believe that our social services are in place for those that struggle, either temporarily or permanently, in our society. Addressing the temporary first, it's important to help those in need, strengthen their foundation and get them back out on their feet again quickly and efficiently. It's in all of our best interests to do this. For those most vulnerable that need continued care, it is a reflection of who we are as a society when we care for these people. We must do it well.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
With the advent of electric cars and more fuel efficient vehicles, state and federal taxes levied on gas are going down. Hopefully fuel efficiency will continue to improve and I'm sure we will be seeing more electric cars on the road every year. This is the trajectory we want to be on. As far as maintaining our transportation infrastructure, we will absolutely have to revisit how we model that need. We will need to create a new and fair system for all users of our roads and bridges.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
In short, yes I believe Maine should continue to incentivize renewable energies here in Maine. Environmentally it's the right thing to do. Economically, it's a sector that's growing with tremendous employment opportunities. However those incentives must be tethered to measurable benchmarks for success and impact.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I would keep the laws around abortion access the same.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be strongly voting against Question 1 this November. Home health care is something we all want, but this specific referendum is flawed in a number of ways - the most egregious are the surtax on middle class families, the privacy issues, the eligibility issues, and the oversight issues. This referendum needs to be torn down and rebuilt from the ground up by experts that come from all sectors of this industry.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I do support a constitutional amendment that would allow RCV in gubernatorial and legislative general elections. It would mandate a majority rule winner, it would eliminate vote splitting and it would discourage candidates from going negative. I watched it closely in this year's primary and was favorably impressed.

Sara Gideon (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
There are three concerns that I've heard repeatedly when talking to business owners and entrepreneurs, regardless of size or industry. The first is the lack of a trained and skilled workforce. The second is access to capital. The third is reliable, high speed internet. There are countless strategies to address these barriers, but it will take all of us - Republican and Democrat, Executive and Legislative, and cross-sector partnerships - to create the environment where businesses can thrive.
[image id=""2708671"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
I have always supported efforts to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, just like the thousands of Maine voters who made this law. It is absolutely disgraceful that nearly a year later this program is still being stymied by our Executive branch. In June 2018, both chambers of the Maine legislature sent a funding bill that would cover the administrative and the claims cost to the governor's desk. I still support this legislation.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Maine's economy is recovering from the great recession at a slower rate than our New England neighbors. Based on that, here's the welfare reform I want to see -good paying jobs everywhere across this state, training and education to help transition people out of welfare and into the workforce, affordable childcare and family leave to ensure that workers can be successful in getting to work and staying at work. This is the welfare reform I believe in and what I will work towards.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
To put it simply, the way that we currently fund our roads and bridges doesn't work. In order to have high-quality, dependable infrastructure, we need to look for new, sustainable revenue streams. This will not only ensure that our roads and bridges are properly funded, but will also free up bond commitments for other priorities. The Transportation Committee has worked on a bipartisan approach in the past, and I hope that they are finally successful in the next Legislature.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
As a past member of the Legislature's EUT Committee, I have always worked to lower energy costs, encourage increased energy efficiency and promote clean and renewable energy, including wind and solar, to capitalize on Maine's natural resources and build a clean energy economy. Our energy consumption is only increasing and that the states who embrace and harness abundant, clean and renewable energy sources from our environment, will be the states that reap the rewards of energy independence.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
With the rights of women to make their own decisions about their reproductive freedoms under assault, I will always be a strong advocate for all providers of the full range of family planning and reproductive health services, including Planned Parenthood. When looking at legislation regarding abortion access, I will always ask myself if it allows women to safely make their own health decisions and control their own futures. If it does meet that critical requirement, it will have my support.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting against Question 1 on this year's ballot. While I recognize the challenges facing families who need home health services, my view is in line with the AARP and the Home Care & Hospice Alliance of Maine who believe this initiative simply isn't the answer. Moving forward, I want to work collaboratively to ensure that home health care services can function for all Maine families and that the hardworking Mainers who do it on a daily basis are adequately compensated.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
The Australians have used ranked choice voting successfully for 100 years. It has not done away with hyper-partisanship but has generally helped move political debate to a rational middle ground as opposed to the extremes. Thus far Maine's ground-breaking experience with RCV has been worthwhile. I support the expansion of ranked choice voting to all our state and federal elections.

Ralph L. Tucker (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Barriers include an aging demographic and remote geography. We need healthy, well-educated and trained work force and a stable political environment. Health care & public schools should be broadened & better funded, plus we should reestablish the state planning office and expand broadband. These efforts should retain & attract workers and businesses.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The extra $1 million, plus, in federal dollars per day for people's health care is worth the appropriation of 1/10 that amount as our state share. Health care coverage is not only a moral right, but smart economics in the long run. The cost would be less than recent revenue losses due to income and estate tax cuts for the very most privileged and wealthy.There are enough current revenues to cover the cost, in any case.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
As currently thrown around, ""welfare reform"" is often used as a dog-whistle code for welfare CUTS through statutory creation of red tape for applicants. This is unfortunately an effective and potent political tool to capture votes by whipping up voter resentments against those who may be in family or economic trouble due to no fault of their own. The voters are being cynically manipulated. Fraud can be managed by competent administration. Better to focus on the causes of economic dislocation.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
The annual highway bond should be funded in the biennial budget as an ongoing need. Bonding should be reserved for new capital projects. I am not expertly familiar with the revenue formulas and sources that underlay our transportation needs.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Because we here in Maine and over the entire Earth are choking on carbon pollution. Conservative politicians and the carbon-based fuel industry are denying a scientific reality. Short term private interests are preventing progress for the long term health of the Earth and the human race.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I support the pragmatic Roe v. Wade consensus. I also strongly support access to reproductive health care, including sex education and contraception, which will reduce the abortion rate far more than any law, no matter how restrictive. This whole abortion debate originated not primarily from religious faith, but from cynical politicians gleefully manipulating and carefully nurturing it as a wedge issue.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Undecided. The energy devoted to worthy goals such as this would be better spent in electing a sympathetic governor and a true majority legislature, rather than overriding the legislative process, especially with highly technical and controversial initiatives.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Undecided. We should see how negative and divisive the current ranked-choice campaigns pan out (Congress), compared to traditional campaigns (Governor).
Michael J. Lawler (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Keeping our young in Maine. The legislation;ature needs to craft incentives that will curb the out migration of our young men and women.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Maine has finite financial resources and I believe that first priority must be to assist the aged and disabled. There should be no assistance to able bodied Mainers until, the needs of the elderly and the disabled have been adequately funded.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The term is pigeon speak. It means nothing to me.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
No.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
No - only the wealthy can afford these renewable solutions.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe that it's a disgrace that our Nation not only allows abortions, but in many ways actually encourages abortions. There will come a day when everyone will agree that abortion is murder, and we will be ashamed of ourselves for allowing it to go on for so long.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will vote NO because retirees filing joint returns are going to get hammered on their retirement incomes and social security.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
NO - it's a preposterous proposition.
House District 51: (Map) Brunswick (part), Harpswell and West Bath
Joyce McCreight (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Our workforce challenges mean we need workers of all types: health care professionals, STEM-trained workers, those skilled in the trades, those working to provide direct care and those who work in our tourist and service industries. We need to improve access to education, training and retraining. We need an approach that looks at the many factors involved in creating the problems and could benefit from the reestablishment of the State Planning Office.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The legislature provided funding requested by the governor but he chose to veto that bill. The influx of funding through Medicaid expansion will greatly benefit our state by improving access to care with long-term benefits that are much less costly that not providing care. It makes economic sense to expand Medicaid for better quality of life and economic security, and because the influx of funds will help our entire economy, particularly our rural hospitals. So called ""free care"" isn't free.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
""Welfare"" has become a hot-button term, unfortunately. While really a neutral or positive term, it has evolved to be a divisive one. ""Welfare reform"" has come to mean cutting out the safety net that any of us could need at a time of crisis through job loss or illness while simultaneously blaming those in such crises. Rather than eliminate or reduce availability of programs and services by creating barriers to access for those most in need, we need to vigorously address any misuse or fraud.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Precisely because our funding mechanisms, i.e. gas taxes, are not meeting the obvious and predictable need to maintain and expand our critical infastructure, we need to address these needs through the budget process, addressing the issue in a more planful, comprehensive way. Recent attempts to address the changing needs by taxing fuel-efficient vehicles is not the way to fix the problem.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely. We need to be innovative in meeting our energy needs and move away from fossil fuel dependency. We can learn and grow from exploring models in other states and countries for innovative technologies, funding and incentives. We need to stop ignoring and denying the problem. As we move forward, though, me must also address the social aspects of new technologies to retain quality of life.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Access to reproductive health care for women and men should not be the political battleground it has become. Decisions of this kind, and other health care decisions, must be between the individual and the health care provider and not the purview of politicians using them for their advantage. The irony is that rather than improving access to contraception, accurate sex education, and family planning which can reduce numbers of abortions, we focus on barriers to a woman's right to her choices.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
The goal of Question 1 is laudable for the help it intends for those with disabilities and for older adults. If it passes, I expect the legislature to address the issue of who would qualify through some level of income requirement and addressing workforce needs. Referenda have been put forward in recent years to address needs not met through legislative process. I look forward to an environment that is more constructive and which truly addresses the needs of vulnerable Maine people.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I am cautious about enacting a constitutional amendment particularly when we can analyze the recent primary election (gubernatorial and a few legislative) and the upcoming congressional elections. We have the opportunity to evaluate and contemplate the impact before we make such a significant change and that seems the most prudent route.

Jennifer DeChant (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
A trained and prepared workforce is one of the large barriers to economic development. Our state needs to attract and keep young workers. This includes workers with vocational training. The legislature can support business trades education and training that is more closely aligned to the real time needs of manufacturers and tech businesses.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Funding sources have already been identified.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
It is always relevant to improve social service programs and enhance delivery systems. Therefore, reform in a consistent, equitable and efficient manner while ensuring that the neediest among us are given a fair shot at success is important reform to pursue. DHHS administers many of the social service programs and there is great opportunity reform program delivery in that context.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
The current approach to funding infrastructure improvements needs to be updated especially since indexing state gas tax ended in 2012. Right now we mostly depend on bonding to patch and improve the roads and bridges that we all depend on and that are essential for commerce. However, a bipartisan approach on behalf of the Transportation Committee and expertise of that committee is needed to develop the options possible.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
We need to move away from dependence on fossil fuels that is underscored by our old housing stock that mostly heats with oil and the rural nature of our state that requires driving long distances. Maine is uniquely positioned to be a leader in renewable energy. Short term investment to develop renewable energy industries will lead to long term efficiencies and wider availability.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I support reproductive rights.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
This is an extremely important issue that should be vetted through the legislative process and be funded through the general fund.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
A Constitutional Amendment is required to implement RCV in those state races. I will continue to support the will of the voters.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Work force training for current and future jobs. This requires better educational opportunities at all levels from high school through community colleges and our 4 year institutions. Also, we need investment in infrastructure, including broadband, a handle on energy costs, and better access to health care. We need to continue to foster Maine's traditional entrepreneurial spirit. This includes fostering the ways we've always used our natural resources to make a living while also preserving them.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Expanding Medicaid is the number one issue I have heard from voters of all ages. There was a funding plan passed by the legislature but vetoed by the current Governor. That should be revisited. I'm committed to working on this. We can't afford not to. Our state's long-term social and economic health depends on it. Too many people spend too much time struggling with decisions about how to care for their family's health needs and also pay the bills. Let's strengthen families, our best resource.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I have seen how state and federal assistance has benefited my students, whether it was access to Maine Care, or TANF, or food stamps, the vast majority of which has been short-term, in order to get through a divorce, a job layoff, an accident. Can we do better to make sure people do not take unfair advantage of these safety nets? Of course. The goal is to empower people to take control of their lives. Education, good job training, access to health care, and reducing childhood hunger are needed.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
We rely on roads and bridges to get to work, to church, to school. Given limited public transportation possibilities in my district, bonding seems sensible, given that these are long-term capital investments. The federal gas tax has not kept pace with inflation but we should be leveraging federal dollars, although the latest plans have flipped the local-federal split, from 80% federal to 20% federal, which unfairly burdens states. That said, I'm interested in working on developing other options.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. We are already feeling the effects of climate change in Maine -- sea level rise, warming seas -- and we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. This is a long-term process, but given our high energy costs, expanding incentives to encourage local, renewable energy can eventually bring those costs down. This is the future we need to build for our kids and our grandkids. We know Maine is a good candidate for solar power, even given its geographic location. Same with off-shore wind.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I support Maine law, which allows abortions before viability, and post-viability to preserve the life and health of the mother. Public funding is allowed to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest. However, in a state as large as Maine, access can be a major barrier, and as a safe medical procedure, we need better access. Supporting women and families through better education and easier access to contraceptives is key to reducing abortions, which is a deeply private decision.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
The referendum question as written is flawed. However, as a private citizen, I will be voting for this to force the legislature to deal with the larger issue of home health care for our elderly, and for our aging state. We need direct care workers, and for them to be better paid. We also need to support aging-in-place initiatives. I am committed to being part of the solution.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. It is something that the voters have supported. Other countries, such as Australia, have done this successfully. Still others, like Brazil, have run-off elections. Some states have run-offs.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Demographics. Just 34 babies per day are born here. Some leave, and others never realize their potential. Even if every young Mainer both stayed and succeeded, we'd have only half the workforce our employers need.
We need to restore the safety net and ladder of opportunity for young families, so more can contribute. We also need to be more open to solar, offshore wind, and meaningful public-private investment in broadband, to attract and retain young people in well-paid jobs.
[image id=""2708673"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Funding concerns have already been addressed. The obstacle has been the Governor's refusal to accept the funding provided by the Legislature, and to obey and implement the law passed by Maine people. 70,000 people are waiting to have health coverage. Further delay costs lives, costs jobs, and is unacceptable.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Originally, ""welfare"" meant ""well-being"" -- the good fortune, health, happiness, prosperity, etc., of a person, group, or organization.
I represent many people in dire poverty; most through no fault of their own. I'd like to see them have access to basic health care, decent housing, and food security so they and their children can more easily be productive citizens.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes. For now, we need to stop the addiction to borrowing and update the gas tax to account for inflation. In the long run, a mileage-plus-weight based fee system may be the solution, but its design and implementation will be tough.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Every energy source is subsidized, and Maine would do well to increase its share of jobs in this fast-growing sectors. That said, we don't need more incentives. What we need is a level playing field, a predictable regulatory environment, a well-trained workforce, and a governor who is not hostile to renewables.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
They should remain as is.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will vote yes. As I write this, seniors I represent are dying prematurely and without adequate home care.
Most seniors want to stay in their homes for as long as possible. Research shows it keeps them happier and healthier. Yet the average home care worker makes $12,500 per year. We are are not meeting our needs.
Incomes below $128k pay into social security. Why can't incomes above it pay into home care?
Clarifications to address opponent concerns are easy to add in the next Legislature.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. RCV allows us to vote our hopes, not our fears, and helps prevent extremist candidates on any side from winning. It empowers the voter rather than the political parties, and has worked well in Australia for a century.

Richard G. Mason (R) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
We have jobs available, but many times not enough people with the proper skills to fill them. We need Mainers to be able to fill jobs in emerging industries and bring former Mainers back home to help with the work shortage. If we can do two of those things businesses can grow because they are getting more done. Maine has a great future if we can press towards getting people to work.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Medicaid expansion is projected to cost over $150 Million in the next biennium. A way to pay for it was not included in the referendum language. The writers of the expansion should have been more thoughtful in their approach if they truly wanted expansion to be a success. Mainer's pockets are not bottomless. We can only afford so much. The next Governor will submit a budget for the legislature to consider. We will have to see what their priorities will be and proceed from there.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I believe in a social safety net, but it shouldn't be a safety hammock. Many of the reforms championed over the past few years have been a remarkable success. In fact they have been heralded nationally for their ingenuity. In the legislature I will continue so support welfare to work, cutting down on cash benefits that cannot be tracked, and working with our federal partners to make favorable adjustments to our participation in federal programs.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I believe that we have to revisit how we fund transportation. As vehicles get more efficient due to federal standards and technological advances less money goes into the highway fund. We have to start by supplementing the highway fund with general fund revenues until we find a permanent solution.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
I believe in an all of the above approach to power. We should not favor one form of energy over the other. Energy prices are calculated on a second by second basis. Maine's energy laws need to be as flexible as possible and adapt to the cheapest possible energy production and delivery method. It doesn't make sense to lock ourselves into long term contracts as is the case with some renewables like solar and wind. All energy should be able to stand on its own prices and merits.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro-life and will advocate for that position.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting No on Question 1. Special interests have stolen our citizens initiative process and this is another example of that. There is no means test, residency requirements, or accountability of funds. Hundreds of millions of dollars would go to special interests groups as defined by law. This is a gross abuse of our process and is being used by people from outside of Maine to line their own pockets. I advise voters to read the legislation before voting on November 6.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I do not support Ranked Choice Voting for many reasons and would not support a constitutional change. I would support a full repeal of RCV and a return to the voting system preferred by our constitution and our founders.

With a strong history as a small business owner, it is imperative that we work for solutions to address our skilled worker shortage. We need to come together and work proactively to entice those that are already in the state to stay, and attract those that would like to work and live our wonderful Maine lifestyle. We will get there with improved and increased access to affordable health care, lower taxes, stronger wages, less red tape, and a vibrant educational system.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We need a solid, long term funding plan for sustainability. The people's referendums are a dangerous way to legislate, there is no accountability of how to fund them, and a burden is put on the legislature to make money appear when there is none. More responsible use of the dollars we spend would allow us to expand to those additional people in need.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We need to work across the aisles to continue to reduce/eliminate waste (both internal and external). We need to make every effort to make sure resources are used to their fullest potential and allocated for programs reporting success in supporting vulnerable people. We need to work as a team to solve this issue.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
We need to get away from borrowing from Maine's future. It should be one of our top priorities; to figure out a funding mechanism that keeps up with our infrastructure needs and should be driven from General fund, Registration, and gas tax revenues. Every single person benefits from our infrastructure. The heaviest users of the system, should be paying a fair share of the cost. The most effective way to collect these funds is by reinstating the gas tax and allow it to be indexing.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Renewable energy is a business. It is not a business that is being disrupted by foreign competition, Weather event or labor shortage. They should be playing by the rules afforded any business trying to make their way. While I do encourage renewable energy technologies research and development. We should not be subsidising companies that are designed to make a profit.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe in choice.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will NOT be voting for Question 1. The question is misrepresented. The math is incorrect. It will cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars of hard earned income.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I do not. A vote is a vote.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
With near full employment and a growing economy, the biggest barrier to continued success is our workforce. As your state representative, I will work to create job opportunities by investing in trade skills and workforce training. To be competitive, we must train our children and those looking for work to fit the jobs of our future economy.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
As your representative, it is my priority to ensure that families have access to affordable, quality health care. While voters approved Medicaid expansion, the question that still remains is how to properly fund the program without abusing tax dollars. In the next Legislature, it will be the job of your representative to work across the aisle to find a funding solution that our state can afford long-term. As your state representative, I will always be at the table willing to work together.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform is ensuring that our social services programs are free of fraud and abuse. It is ensuring that your tax dollars are used for Maine families in need and not those who are taking advantage of the system. Most importantly, welfare reform is providing those families who need help at the moment a path to a job and opportunity toward prosperity.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
The state needs to continue with infrastructure improvements without passing an increased bill to the Maine people. Due to the build up of the ""rainy day"" fund and strengthening our economy over the past 8 years, we have seen a surplus in the state budget. This allows borrowing to be apart of the conversation. I would focus new ways to save expenses, such as, merging the MTA with the DOT, and working to dedicate general fund dollars, ongoing, to improving our infrastructure.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
We have a duty to protect our environment. However, I do not believe the State should play a role by subsiding companies to expand the technology of that time, making them wealthy and leaving the state always a step behind. Technology is moving quickly, and we must look to the future and what is coming and make a long term strategic plan for our state's renewable energy portfolio. When it comes to any energy policy, I will ask one simple question, ""How much does it cost the Maine taxpayer?""
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro-life.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting no. I believe Mainers should have access to affordable, quality healthcare. Heavily taxing families to put millions of dollars into a program with little oversight, and no direction on how to administer is unacceptable. Put this through the proper legislative process to ensure it is funded properly, it is set up with accountability measures, and it doesn't abuse taxpayers. Another example of out of state special interest groups trying to tell Mainers what is best for them.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. The Constitution provides voters the right to one vote. I believe in the system that our founding fathers designed and believe we should focus our time on ensuring Mainers are educated on the issues with the goal of improving our voter turnouts. That is the true way to give everyone a voice in our democracy.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
A trained workforce, young people need to be trained in engineering, technology, and mathematics. We need to create a method for students to reduce or eliminate their student debt. Good public public transportation, and infrastructure would also help.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Tobacco moneys in maine has been shifted away from preventive care, I think this should be used to expand Mainecare as far as it would go. Otherwise the expansion will eventually save dollars because we will have a healthier workforce who will be able to work.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I think it is a derogatory term to demean people who receive a hand up.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, gas tax is not adequate, and we all need to go places. I think we could add a VAT tax to items we buy especially items that are brought in from other states. This would also help to remind people to buy local.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes! climate change is the biggest threat we face in our generation.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I think a woman's body is hers, and that it is much more destructive to restrict access to care.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I am worried about the bill as written. Taxes should be vetted and levied by the Legislature. We do need to restructure Home Care services, it is going to take a lot of planning, and that includes paying a living wage to workers.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, it gives more choice and eliminate the problem of people being elected with a minority vote.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
We need to attract and retain new workers and families to address our current and future labor shortages. This means (among many other things) making healthcare affordable - one of the top reasons workers cite for not changing jobs or starting new businesses is the inability to maintain health insurance; expanding training opportunities for those interested in skilled trades; and providing student debt relief so that Mainers are able to get the education they need to fill the jobs available.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Mainers voted to expand Medicaid and that expansion needs to be implemented. Beginning in 2020, states that opt to expand Medicaid will receive 90% of the funding from the Federal government (more than 90% prior to 2020). If the State then taxes the extra economic activity (wages, supplies, etc.) generated by that Federal funding, and we factor in the savings from reduced state spending on traditional Medicaid, then we should be in a position to cover more than the State's 10% share.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
""Welfare reform"" is a phrase that is too often used to defend limiting access to our social safety net and cutting benefits to our most vulnerable populations. What I believe the phrase should represent is a commitment to revisiting our social welfare programs regularly and consistently to determine their effectiveness. I fully support eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse while ensuring we continue to protect these services for those who need them.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I am not opposed to borrowing money to maintain and improve our infrastructure through bonds, but that represents only one tool we should be using to fund improvements to our roads and bridges. While the Federal gas tax is becoming outdated, it also hasn't been increased since 1993, and now may be the perfect time to implement such an increase. In addition, we should consider changes that would add efficiency to the complex approval processes that slow down projects and increase costs.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Maine should be decreasing its reliance on fossil fuels in as many ways as possible. The benefits of renewable energy include improved public health through better air and water quality, the provision of future electricity needs, job creation and economic development, stable energy costs, and reliability. It is imperative that we support these technologies not only for the economic health of our state, but for the physical health of our children.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe every woman has the right to choose a safe abortion, and that lawmakers should not be impeding that choice, but rather upholding established law. Nearly 87% of US counties, including many rural counties in Maine, do not have an abortion provider, leaving a significant portion of Maine's population without access to safe abortions and at risk of related negative health consequences. I would support increasing the qualifications of NPs, CNMs, and PAs to allow them to provide abortions.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I support the theory behind this initiative 100%. My mother passed away from Alzheimer's Disease this year. As the disease progressed, we were forced to move her to a facility because having a homecare worker was too costly. However, my concerns with this initiative include the cost, the fact that it did not and will not ever receive a public hearing or a hearing before the Maine Legislature, and my belief that our priority should be on funding the Medicaid expansion already approved by voters.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. I believe this was the original intent of the initiative that Maine voters approved and that the will of Maine voters should be honored. Personally, I see a lot of value in ranked-choice voting because it requires candidates to get a majority of votes to win. I also believe that it creates a more engaged and informed electorate, and led to more positive campaigning by primary candidates who recognized the need to earn second- and third-choice support from voters.

Heidi E. Brooks (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The Legislature needs to improve lifelong learning opportunities for all members of our community. One of the biggest barriers we face is lack of a trained workforce. We can do better with apprenticeship programs, community college and higher education. We need to retain and recruit community members to fill positions that provide at least a livable wage with benefits. If people are paid a more fair wage, they will have more income to invest into the community.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The administration's refusal to expand MaineCare is probably its biggest failure. Accepting federal funds for MaineCare several years ago would have saved lives, prevented suffering, and would have infused our healthcare system with much needed resources. MaineCare could have been funded through the next biennial budget. Future Legislatures and a new administration need to come together to prioritize healthcare.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Over the past several years our social service programs have deteriorated. The public health nursing program is just one example. Public health nursing positions were dramatically cut. There was a bill brought forward by Senator Brownie Carson to help restore some of these critical nurses. It became law over a veto; however, the implementation has been poor. The Department of Health and Human Services has suffered from cuts and hiring freezes. ""Welfare reform"" has had negative consequences.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes. We need safe roads and bridges. Finding sustainable ways to fund our infrastructure is critical. The transportation budget could be improved by having the corporations using large trucks that cause the most wear and tear on our roads pay a more fair share.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. We need to be doing more to address the reality of climate change. We need to move to renewable energy as soon as possible.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
A woman's right to access healthcare needs to be preserved.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I support the universal home-care initiative. Our aging and disabled population needs to be treated with dignity and respect. Our population is aging and we need to address our home-care crisis. Providing modest home-care support can greatly improve a person's quality of life and can help them stay in their homes for as long as possible.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections because I have heard from a large number of Mainers that they would favor more choice when voting.
Michael R. Lachance (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Our high property taxes and cost of living are coupled to a government that is self-destructively pre-occupied only with coddling to non-profits, socialism, social services and so many other profitless entities that drain our tax dollars, lower standards of living and perpetuate blight. If we want economic development we will have to get over the fact that developers won't develop where they aren't welcome. So long as this bizarre fixation remains, Maine will never see true economic development.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
When Bills are not financially viable, they typically die in committee. Yet when referenda are not financially viable we expect a different outcome? Voters approve Bonds to fund Highways and Roads, yet do not present a means of funding a financially reckless Medicaid expansion. Question 1 will be no different if passed. This exposes real and critical flaws in our referendum process. It is for good reason we are a Constitutional Republic with a Representative Government and not a Pure Democracy.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
A hand up or a hand out? Ronald Reagan summed it up in 1987 when he said ""It's now common knowledge that our welfare system has itself become a poverty trap--a creator and reinforcer of dependency."" When we chose to de-stigmatize welfare we ignored the reality of human nature. So long as we award participation trophies to capable individuals who choose to sit out the game of life, we will never see true welfare reform.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Bonding in perpetuity should be discouraged. Maine needs to continue to prioritize our roads and highways without relying so heavily on bonding. Our transportation infrastructure is far more critical to the economic vitality of Maine than many other programs and expenses that are rarely bonded.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
No. Let the private sector invest private dollars in these pie-in-sky (literally) ventures. Our tax dollars are spread thin enough as it is.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Outside of the debate over abortion itself, the practice and industry of abortion should not be funded with public taxpayer dollars.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I oppose Question 1. All 4 candidates for Governor also oppose this Maine Peoples Alliance scam. Question 1 is reckless, flawed and sets dangerous precedents. Bad policy, bad for Maine and at catastrophic taxpayer expense.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I oppose Ranked Choice Voting. I also agree with the Maine Supreme Judicial Court's 2017 opinion that Ranked Choice Voting is unconstitutional in Maine and that ""when a statute �"" including one enacted by citizen initiative �"" conflicts with a constitutional provision, the constitution prevails.""

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Regulation and taxation. Make sure that the regulation aren't to onerous and that taxes to strangle the development.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Priority in funding in the budget and savings in programs.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Changing Welfare program to Work Progress Program. That way people get a hand up not a hand out.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, looking at dedicated periodic transfers from the general fund, public private partnerships, special fuel taxes dedicated to projects, and infrastructure banks to consider just a few.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Over the years oil and gas has received incentives and tax breaks. Renewable energy should be granted the same incentives. In the future as resources dictate it will be a combination of all the resources available to supply our energy needs.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
It should remain as it has since Roe v Wade with only certain restrictions for late term abortions
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Voting for. I would prefer changes to certain the bill regarding personnel and income restrictions.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I would support changes to the constitution allowing ranked choice voting.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Red Tape. Being a small business owner I dealt with and am still dealing with the red tape of starting a small business. Strict guidelines that don't fit your business, inflated fees, lack of communication or poor communication, etc. We need to focus on growing small Maine businesses that feed our economy instead of hindering it. We need to keep jobs here, keep students in our State after graduation, and therefore keeping our money here.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
What we need to get us started with expansion is there. The rest needs to be worked into the budget. The 1-9 ratio makes sense to me. Expanding medicaid has so many benefits including lessening the burden on taxpayers, getting people the preventative care they need, helping keep our older generation in their homes, providing care for those with addictions, etc.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Reforming or making changes to the current welfare systems to prevent abuse. I believe we need to work with people to help them get back to work. There should also be a gradual slide as they lose their benefits instead of just cutting people off. Studies show that once welfare reliant people get back to work there is a huge success rate in keeping them working and that means less money out of taxpayers pockets.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, just as you budget for expenses in your home, we need to budget for the maintenance of our infrastructure. Annual borrowing and bonding only adds to our debt and paying it back usually means making cuts elsewhere.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes, we need energy independence. Other sources of power has so many benefits by stabilizing energy costs, putting money back in our pockets, and keeping money in our State grows OUR economy.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I think they should remain as they are.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting against it ONLY because the percentages are too high and imposes too much of a tax on just a select few hard working families. I believe this should go back to the legislature to be reworked because I DO believe there is a solution in helping us keep our aging population in their homes.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
At first I wasn't sure I supported this, but change is good as we continue to improve our processes. I do like how this allows us to choose the best and more importantly the worst candidate for the job.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine does not have a state-wide economic development plan. By assessing Maine's strengths and weaknesses and setting goals, we can better understand where we should be focusing our economic development resources. Additionally, investing in Broadband infrastructure will allow entrepreneurs to create new businesses and allow remote workers to live where they choose, particularly in rural areas. Workforce training for the jobs of the future will provide an opportunity for new business to thrive.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The Legislature voted to appropriate the funds necessary for administration of the program in the last session, though the Governor vetoed that bill. The state has current revenue available to fund the program until we address ongoing funding through the traditional budgeting process. Drawing down the federal $1-$9 match will help stimulate the economy in the health care sector, potentially creating thousands of new jobs.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
To me, ""welfare reform"" means that we incentivize work through our social services programs, assuring that there aren't barriers to work. The cost of childcare, transportation, and a loss of benefits based on a too low income threshold are barriers to work. Tapering benefits in accordance with reasonable income thresholds and making sure that education and training are incentivized would be ""reform"" that would pay long term dividends.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Bonding to maintain our transportation infrastructure is not a sustainable solution. By bringing all stakeholders together to suggest ideas about how we might accomplish a long-range maintenance schedule, and listening carefully to every idea, we may be able create innovative funding streams. We shouldn't rule out any suggestion, and we may find that there are multiple opportunities for infrastructure funding.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Energy independence for Maine could add significant jobs and contribute to a more robust economy across the state. Currently, we subsidize fossil fuel consumption for energy and the impacts on our environment are not well factored into those costs. If we invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency, we could save a great deal in the long term on both heating and electricity costs.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Maine's abortion access laws appear sufficient at this time.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Question 1 is the beginning of an important conversation, long overdue, about how we will help older people age in place in Maine. Unfortunately, because of the language in the referendum and concerns over the funding mechanism, I can't support it.
The Legislature will be able to begin to address the issue in the next session. Looking ahead, there are some programs already in existence through the Federal government that Maine might look to as a model.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I supported such an amendment in the 128th Legislature after voters overwhelmingly approved the measure in 2016.
Gregory Earl Foster (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Businesses have left Maine or are not interested in locating here in part due to the higher cost of doing business. The legislature needs to reduce costly government imposed burdens and taxes. Lack of Broadband is often mentioned as a hindrance to conducting business in many parts of Maine. There probably is a roll for the Legislature to assist in some manner in getting this service extended, and I would entertain some kind of state partnership getting that done.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
I believe Governor LePage is correct, that Medicaid expansion should be sustainably funded without increasing taxes, funding gimmicks, or limiting coverage to those currently on Medicaid. The Legislature needs to establish priorities for funding, which may mean cutting funding to other programs to pay for the expansion.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform is when the state is in an economic position where fewer people need welfare to exist. This is accomplished when we lower the cost of government by reducing taxes and government imposed burdens for business and individuals, resulting in higher retained income and a lower need for welfare.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I find it interesting that this paper considers gas taxes to be ""increasingly outdated"". It seems quite appropriate that taxes from gasoline are used for transportation infrastructure maintenance. If revisiting the way to fund infrastructure means creating a new tax or tax method, such as the Janette Mills tax by the mile, then I expect the old tax or tax method to disappear. Revisiting transportation funding should consider avoiding borrowing money and thus the extra cost of borrowing.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
No. Any new energy sources should become available because it is cost effective. When renewable energy costs are competitive with existing energy sources, the public will use them and demand products that use them. Additionally, we are yet unable to sustainably fund Medicaid expansion, and lots of other things. Why should we continue to find more ways to spend the peoples money, when out of the fifty states Mainers are third from the bottom in average income?
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Abortion laws should be more restrictive. Laws pertaining to the counseling of risks and alternatives in advance of committing to kill an unborn baby, are reasonable.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?I will be voting against question 1. It creates an unconstitutional fourth branch of government answerable only to board members who are accountable to nobody. There is no over-site by the legislature, the peoples only recourse for directing how their money is being spent or who is on the board. There are many other undesirable aspects of this proposal whereby it deserves to be called a SCAM.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I will not support a constitutional amendment allowing Ranked choice voting. It is a convoluted system that already has disenfranchised voters. A plurality of the vote has and will continue to work.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The lack of broadband internet access is a great barrier to bringing companies to Maine or allowing Maine residents to telecommute. Currently the ConnectMe Fund is supposed to ensure expansion and improvement of broadband service by charging a 0.25% fee on all phone bills. In contrast, the Maine USF surcharge to ensure that all Mainers have basic landline phone service is 2.1% of all phone bills. The legislature could inject more money into broadband access by revising these fee structures.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The tobacco settlement money could be used in the short term to fund Medicaid expansion. In the long term, the legislature needs to look at the total budget expenditures and develop priorities in the spending of tax dollars. Certainly, given that greater than 57% of voters approve of the Medicaid expansion, that should be given top priority.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Generally welfare reform means cutting social services. Instead, I'd like to see more of an emphasis on counseling and training of recipients. I think the focus needs to be on reviewing the barriers for obtaining and keeping a job. Is it transportation, workforce training, medical issues, children at home? Programs such as ASPIRE should be expanded to enable more people find jobs that will pay them enough so welfare is no longer necessary .
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Maine has 47,000 miles of roads funded by a 30 cent per gallon tax. By contrast, the Maine Turnpike is only about 300 miles and is funded by the tolls collected from Kittery to Augusta. Considering that everyone on the turnpike must exit onto local roads, it's time for the Turnpike Authority to start sharing some of its toll revenue to increase the ability to repair and maintain the roads most of us travel on every day.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The state should expand incentives for renewable energy. Often, the expensive one time cost prevents many people from looking at the long term savings. As new energy technologies are used it helps to lessen our reliance on fossil fuels. And, as an added benefit, it helps to lessen air and water pollution.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I don't believe there should be any change in the access to abortion that Maine law currently allows.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting against Question 1. As the law is worded, approximately 25% of the taxes generated would be for administration costs. The Question requires a whole new Agency be created with its own board to manage these funds. I don't think we should be adding more to the existing State bureaucracy.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. If the state is doing ranked choice voting in one race, it should be consistent in other all of the races. If it means changing the constitution, then it should be done.

Walter N Riseman (U)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
It is hard to point to just one barrier. It is a combination of infrastructure, adequate skilled worker availability, and lack of vision in regards to matching potential industry with existing strengths. The Legislature can help address these issues by working to upgrade highway systems, creating state-wide internet availability, and making available multi-level job training initiatives. Finally, an incentive program needs to be established to attract compatible commerce.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Absolutely the state needs to more forward in funding the Medicaid expansion. A prosperous future for the state lies in healthy communities and its potential workforce. If need be, the funding will have to come from re-balancing the tax structure or reserves.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare is a system of safety nets provided to those individuals and families in the most need. It is intended to be a ""helping hand,"" and not a ""handout,"" so that recipients can become a productive member of society in some form.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
No. Funding infrastructure through taxes in combination the borrowing can be a workable method if the state commits to creating and following through on a well thought-out capital expenditure plan.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely yes. The path to a prosperous future for our communities and future generations will come from looking forward for sources of energy technologies which are environmentally compatible and not back to outdated energy forms. We should make available expanded but accountable incentives.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
No. They seem to be fair under current circumstances. However we should fight any attempt on the Federal level to restrict laws.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
My current position is to vote no, not that I am against the concept. However, we need to have a financially balanced policy in regards to adequately funding a multitude of wellness needs throughout our State. In this case, I am not convinced the bureaucracy that might be created, is well thought out.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
""I absolutely support a constitutional amendment to complete the citizens' desire to implement rank choice voting. I believe a lot of the current partisanship in Augusta is being caused by an election process which elects officials by plurality and not majority. It has led to a candidates being elected who have not achieved a majority of votes cast.
Ranked choice worked well in the last election for those races where it was used.""

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Attracting new and young workers to Maine and/or to stay here is a significant aspect of economic growth. Strengthening our education system, offering incentives to new businesses, and developing improved technology to meet the daily needs of local businesses will help bring economic change.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The Legislature needs to look at the benefits from implementing Medicaid expansion - a significant amount of federal funding, increase in job opportunities, support for our rural hospitals, as well as preventative care. It seems reasonable that working together, a solution for continued funding will be found and needs to be found.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
""Welfare reform"" is about seeking more efficient and just ways to assist those in our communities who need extra support and in some cases provide incentives to help individuals stand on their own.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
A strong infrastructure is vital to Maine's economy making it important to have a thorough review of current spending and future needs alongside other funding possibilities.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies is a win/win. With the right approach, it will make energy more affordable, bring new job opportunities and increase quality of life through a healthier environment.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
A woman's reproductive rights should not be controlled by state or federal law, therefore laws that inhibit a woman from making those choices for herself should not be permitted.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I agree improved home care is needed, however I do not agree that targeting a particular tax bracket is the answer. A more thorough plan needs to be looked at and a more responsible means of funding it.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections should become the norm. It is a responsible and fair means of voting allowing for a greater participation and opportunity for all.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine has traditionally relied on textiles, paper products, and shoe manufacturing. Those times are past. We must now innovate and evolve to new industry, hemp. Hemp can be a great cash crop which is usable for clothing, medicine, oil, livestock feed, bio-degradable plastics and pharmaceuticals. The market is there, develop it.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We are the only country in the modern world to not have universal healthcare coverage for all. People without coverage use the emergency rooms for primary care, which costs us all dearly. I believe in a system of Medicare for All, with reasonable rates for all. Treat it like auto insurance, whereby all pay into the system and all are covered.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform is a dog whistle that has been thrown about for years by politicians, meaning 'you're lazy, get a job'. The truth is, many people either can't work or can't find a job. People are suffering, and to blame them for needing help is heartless.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
With the advent of fuel efficient vehicles and electric vehicles, gas taxes will no longer pay the way. While I don't really care for tolls, making people pay for what they use is , to me, the fairest way to subsidize infrastructure improvements. Why does I-95 have tolls from Kittery to Augusta, yet nothing beyond. The southern portion of Maine is paying for the rest of the state, while still maintaining the roads.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. People say that wind turbines are noisy and kill birds. While that may true, until you have walked the mountain trails and seen the damage from fossil fuels, we need renewables. I have, and I'll take renewables any day.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe that a woman's right to choose what she does in a decision that not only is a lifelong commitment, but a very traumatic decision, is no one else's business but hers. For others to think otherwise is wrong, it's not your right to demand otherwise.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
For. With the baby boomer generation coming to the end of life, we must realize that nursing facilities that are underfunded and understaffed will not be able to handle the load. Keeping people in their homes as long as possible is not only humane, but cost effective.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, I do. It not only makes elections more accessible to minorities, but makes thge broken 2 party system more accountable. It gives independent candidates a more even chance of success. We have for years been voting for the lesser of 2 evils, put forth by the political parties, RCV levels the playing field.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Lack of state economic development focus on rural areas of the state. Economic growth in greater Portland, Bangor and LA has only marginal impact, at best, in western and northern Maine. Its too far too drive daily, transportation infrastructure is insufficient and skills don't match up well.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The Legislature needs to make funding the top priority among many other priorities. The federal government will provide most of the financial support and, especially in rural areas, better health care will mean healthier communities and, financially, healthier hospitals and other medical providers.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare cannot be a static program without never changing to meet the needs and challenges of Maine today. It means recognizing some of the more significant barriers to work, such as lack of affordable childcare and a depressingly low minimum wage, and working to correct those situations so folks who want to work can and those who don't are treated accordingly.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Infrastructure is almost always a capital item so funding by bonding makes good financial sense. The gas tax needs to be revised to address the situation of electric and hybrid car drivers not paying their fair share for use of roads. My wife and I have two hydrids and we are more than willing to pay our fair share.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Of course. The solar and off-shore wind industries are ready to explode in growth and need the same types of incentives that many other states provide. Not only will they provide solid alternatives to more traditional electrical generation, they represent terrific employment opportunities for our residents and investment opportunities for our Maine-bred entrepreneurs.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Remain as it is.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Yes. Under almost any circumstances, in-home and community support services are less costly than nursing homes. While the referendum question may not be perfect, if approved by the voters it would represent a quantum leap in keeping senior citizens and those with disabilities in our communities and neighborhoods.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. I think it is a terrific idea. The choice among candidates is not always black and white. Ranked choice voting allows me to select an order of priority among candidates. A vote for one does not automatically represent rejection of another candidate since I can still support the second candidate as my second choice.

Christina Riley (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Too many people in our rural areas make too little money, because the manufacturing sector has dwindled. We should revitalize the State's forest-products economy by investing more in bringing new technologies, like nanocellulose products and cross-laminated timber, to the market, so that Maine can be on the forefront of their production. The export of locally-manufactured forest products is a powerful economic influence, and we are in prime position to capitalize on the opportunity.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The Governor vetoed the funding the Legislature allocated. Considering that he also proposed to cut taxes by more than the expansion's cost, it is clear that sees that the funding is available, but he prefers to cut taxes rather than complying with the law. Mainers have chosen repeatedly via the Legislature, and in a general vote, to expand Medicaid, and it is the Governor's sworn responsibility to faithfully execute that law using the funding the Legislature provided.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We need to balance the needs of the downtrodden with those of the more fortunate, in order to have a livable society for everyone. Creating good policy depends on understanding economics, human psychology, and history, rather than responding strictly to populist impulses. People with disabilities and other difficult circumstances should be employed as fully as possible, but regardless of their ability to work, they should have what they need to live satisfactory lives.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
It is urgent that we do. Like any tax policy, it is complicated, and the angles evolve as technology and trends change how we live. The funding plan needs to reduce our dependence on bonds for infrastructure needs, while balancing the impact on taxpayers and those who use the roads. The burden should not fall inordinately on business, as the pass-through effect of the tax only makes it harder for certain Maine industries to compete.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
All energy is subsidized; I support shifting subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables, partly because it is an economic opportunity for Maine, which has no fossil fuel resources. Renewable energy is a natural resource that we should manage just like we manage our forest resources, with a strong mandate to protect the natural environment. We should prioritize the types of installations that bring the greatest benefits to ratepayers as a whole, such as community solar and grid-scale storage.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
We should make every effort to prevent unintended pregnancies, but I generally will not support measures that will make it more difficult for a woman to exercise her right to control her fertility. When we do that, wealthy women travel for abortions and poor women risk mutilation. Given sufficient access to education and effective birth control, people are better able to avoid unplanned pregnancies, and our public policies should encourage that.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
This initiative would help my own family, but I cannot support it. People who are older or who have disabilities should have the support they need to stay in their homes as much as possible. But this initiative would create legislative gridlock much as the school funding initiative �"" Question 2 of 2016 �"" did. It is not sound tax policy. We have existing programs that could better serve the need if funded properly, but those funds should come from the general fund, not a surtax.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I do. The initiative passed, showing that Mainers do want this style of voting. If two-thirds of the Legislature passes the amendment, that question will also go to voters. This is the only path to fully implement what started as a citizens' initiative, and unless there is a pressing reason not to fully implement it, which I do not see, we should respect that. No one is forced to use ranked-choice if they prefer not to.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Workforce training, there are many jobs available in the trades but we have a shortage of workers to fill them. We need to encourage and incentivize Mainers that want to pursue a career in the trades.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
I believe there needs to be a long term sustainable funding source attached to the medicaid expansion. I don't believe in using one time sources or gimmicks is the way to go. We also need to prioritize so that Maine's most vulnerable are at the front of the line rather than able bodied adults with no children.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform means requiring people that are able bodied to search for a job. We should judge the success of welfare by how many people we move off the rolls. We need to crack down on those that have used EBT cards out of state in vacation destinations such as Disney World or Las Vegas.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
One of the great successes of the last 8 years has been our bond rating has improved from when Baldacci was in office. This allows us to borrow money at a lower interest rate. I would support bonding for essential projects as long as there is no pork in the bill.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
I don't believe in subsidizing any energy resources by raising the electric bills of low income and elderly Mainers. If solar and wind power can compete in a free market, I am all for it. I don't believe state government should subsidize it.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro-life, and believe that life begins at conception. This is an issue that has become far too polarized in American politics. I know good people that I respect that feel differently. As far as laws, I would support restrictions on abortions when the baby is viable outside the womb.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting on on question 1. I believe that it is a tax on job creators that will cause those people to leave Maine. I also don't like that it creates a shadow government board that is not accountable to the taxpayers of Maine. It is another example of why we need to fix the referendum process to make it harder for out of state special interests to accomplish their goals.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No, I am opposed to ranked choice voting along with 57% of the voters of Leeds, Livermore, and Turner. I believe in one person, one vote. If I am elected I will represent their voice in Augusta, not Portland and out of state special interest groups.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The aging population of Maine. Create service, apprenticeship, job training and other opportunities to retain/recruit young people to work in Maine.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
This is now law and it is up to the Legislature to fund it through the state budget process.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The term often means measures designed to remove people from the state's entitlement programs.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Bonds are legitimate ways to fund infrastructure and should be used now, before interest rates climb. In addition, there should be a broad discussion about the needs of the future and if there are additional sources of revenue.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Fossil fuels contribute to global warming and are finite. We need a comprehensive energy plan for Maine. The expansion will also create jobs.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Neither.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against. It is not a long term solution to the issue that we face.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. This is the will of the voters expressed through the referendum process.
Dennis L. Keschl (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Barriers are Maine's high tax burden, high cost of energy, and lack of qualified applicants for available jobs, and an infrastructure geared for the 19th and 20th century not the 21st century. The Legislature can reform our tax system, provide incentives for infrastructure investments, invest in our community colleges focused on STEM courses and collaborative efforts between our businesses and community colleges, and broaden the use of alternative energy sources to include nuclear energy.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Medicaid expansion passed by a citizen initiative process became law without identifying a funding mechanism. To fund it, in part, the Legislature must look at its current budget and seek reductions. We may have to reduce scope of existing programs or completely eliminate them. We cannot look to the ""rainy day fund"" or an increase in taxes. A review of our current tax structure and tax expenditures, included a broadening of our sales tax may provide funds necessary.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform means making those changes in our societal support system that are necessary to ensure that it is a true ""safety net"" and not a way of life for those who are participating in it, and those who are participating in it should be limited in what they can purchase and where they can purchase it. The State should provide support and help recipients to become self-sufficient without relying on the state.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes we should revisit it, however, bonding will be part of the mix that is used to fix our highway infrastructure for some time into the future. Maine should ""think out of the box"" for ways to enhance current federal and state taxes that raise money through the sale of energy needed to fix and maintain the our highway infrastructure, up to and including new GIS locational technology.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Encouraging renewable energy using incentives that put more cost on low-income Mainers is not right. If there are people who want solar and wind energy project for their residential dwellings...they should purchase them. Large scale solar and wind are not environmentally friendly nor do they provide base power load which we need. Maine should look at it current policy on supporting modern, modular nuclear power plants development.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
The issue of access to abortions is settled law through the Supreme Courts decision on Roe vs. Wade.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I am voting no on Question 1 for many reasons, including issues involving its constitutionality, problems with the body overseeing its implementation, potentially significant HPPA violations, and the fact it is a job killer. People writing these initiatives promise so much when in fact they deliver little, but cost Mainers significant time and money. As I currently understand it, not one of the four gubernatorial candidates supports this question.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. Ranked Choice Voting is a scheme that promises to deliver a majority that is not a majority of the total vote cast, thus it disenfranchises voters. I believe that there are strong constitutional problems with it, including the violation of a basic principle...""one-person/one-vote. It is a terrible law that is subject to gaming.

Reduce spending on unnecessary items .
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?

4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
If the fuel taxes were spent on infrastructure which it was mean for we wouldn't need to bond every election cycle.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. It is an endless available resource.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Businesses consider several factors in deciding where to locate and how much to invest. Among these are taxes, regulatory environment and a trained workforce. The Legislature should establish a tax structure that is more attractive than that of other states, enact regulations that are stable and predictable, encourage private sector employers to work closely with our educational institutions, and always keep in mind that it needs to listen to job creators when setting public policy.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Funding should first of all be sustainable. Using one time resources is not the answer. Requiring able-bodied people to work or be on the path to employment and also paying at least a small portion of the costs should be included. We will need to choose what other programs may have to be curtailed in order to pay for it since Maine does not have an infinite supply of funds, We will have to prioritize so that the elderly and others who are the most in need to not get overlooked.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Some welfare reform has already begun and it needs to continue. It should be stressed that for most people, welfare is a temporary situation and there always needs to be a path out of it, probably through a tiered program towards economic independence. Any recipient who is able should be required to seek work or be in a a training program that will lead to gainful employment. We should also refine the list of what is eligible for welfare payment so that only real necessities are included.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
We should rely less on borrowing, especially a interest rates are rising. Money spent on interest is money that can't go directly towards improving our infrastructure. We may need to revisit the gas tax, but by no means should we allow automatic escalators to increase it every year. We should also charge fees on electric vehicles so that their owners pay their fair share of fixing our roads. We should also continue to find more ways to stretch every tax dollar we take in.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
I am all for renewable energy as long as it is competitive in price. I am generally not in favor of more incentives since they are in essence subsidies, and subsidies normally mask the true costs of anything, including energy. It is unfair to ask poor people to pay parts of the electric bills of people who are often much better off financially than they themselves are. We shouldn't ignore the fact that some of the alternative energy construction is an eyesore to many people and hurts tourism
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro-life and do not want abortion access laws loosened. We need to respect the value of human life more, even for the pre-born. Any abortion clinics should be required to meet licensing requirements similar to other medical facilities. Counseling on alternatives to abortion should be required, a waiting period established, and in the case of minors, parents need to be involved.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
No. Proper care for the elderly and disabled should be the goal, but this is not the answer for a number of reasons: there is no needs requirement so that very well off people would get free care; there is no residency requirement; there is an unlawful invasion of privacy regarding people's health records; the huge income tax increase would drive many high tax payers to other states; and there is absolutely no accountability to any oversight agency, making it rife for abuse.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. It violates the principle of one person, one vote by allowing a voter's 4th, 5th, or whatever choice it may be to have the same weight as my first choice. We should remember that the original referendum question setting this in motion did not pass by much, and many parts of the state, including my district, voted against it. It is another example of how a well-funded outside group can force its will on others. The entire issue of the referendum process needs to be addressed.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Health care. This affects the entire chain from ownership to workers. A broken health care system means that Mainers are making some sort of compromised decision about hiring, expanding, paying rent, buying food, paying electricity bills, etc.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
I disagree that there is a lack of ""dedicated funding"". This is largely because of a desire by the previous Governor to not support ""dedicating"" the money. We've got money to last through 2019. This is, for many Mainers, a dire situation made worse when nearly six out of ten voters of Maine voted to approve this. The fact that we're still not putting this into action is a display of ideological and bureaucratic choice. I would fund this beyond 2019 by budgetary means.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I believe that the welfare system requires fundamental change. The basis for support must be transformed to incentivizing work rather than punishing the poor. We require investment in targeted training and mentorship. To be angry at welfare doesn't make the problem go away. We also need to allow people to wean themselves off of support in a manner that does not make going unemployed a better option than working in any level of work.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes. The fuel tax in America has not been raised since 1993 and it is not indexed to inflation. We need to seriously look at raising the fuel tax and updating the new legislation in ways that account for use by electric/hybrid vehicles. In addition, Maine needs to consider a comprehensive long-term infrastructure improvement plan. While this is costly, I would argue the associated benefits to commerce, economy, jobs and communities far outweigh increased short-term expense.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes! Utilities are changing and our laws and economy have not caught up. We need to support incentives to consumers and businesses to transition to renewable energies. Not only is this sound policy in support of Maine's precious resource, its environment, but it also can stimulate and enhance Maine's reputation and position nationally and internationally in research and manufacturing in renewable energy sciences and industries.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe the current laws are adequate and proper. I believe that medical decisions about a person's body are between them and their physician.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting against it, however, I will be working to address what the referendum is trying to accomplish, healthcare and home services support for elderly in Maine. I would say that the Referendum is another case of desperately trying to find a solution to a complex and dire problem that is not being responsibly addressed by the Legislature.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. While I'm not sure it would pass, I think we really do need to consider and debate the state of our elections in Maine. Most of what RCV attempts to address is that lack of broad consensus, and thus support, when there are more than two candidates for leadership in Augusta.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The biggest barrier to our economic development is a failure to realize what makes our state so special and a lack of creativity about how to capitalize on our assets in the modern economy. The lack of broadband is inexcusable. People can work from anywhere today, but not in most places in Maine. Given the quality of life possible here, we should be doing all we can technologically to make Maine the gold standard. Broadband would help our students, attract investment, and increase population.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Funding could be addressed in at least two ways. One, revisiting the tax cuts passed over the past 8 years to see if they are fair and reflect a progressive tax system. Two, again looking at our assets, we should consider raising our lodging tax. If Maine is Vacation land, and it seems to be, tourists will continue to visit. The resulting expansion in revenue could help fund the voter approved expansion of access to health care.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
How a society treats those who are struggling and in need, defines it. We must continue to help those who cannot help themselves, while looking to make sure that people can find opportunity and escape poverty. True welfare reform is about making prosperity possible for all through education, training, and some support.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Knowing that nobody likes taxes, sometimes they need to be updated and increased where appropriate. The quality and safety of our roads and infrastructure is not a partisan issue; at least it should not be. State and federal gas taxes have not come close to reflecting inflation for far too long. If we do not look at them, we are being incredibly shortsighted.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Climate change is real if one looks at and believes science. I do. Our reliance on fossil fuels is a major cause. Solar power and responsible wind power development can decrease reliance on the fuels that fuel climate change. We have traditionally incentivized fossil fuels because private players make money. The cost for renewable energy benefits the public and our planet.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
A woman's choice about her healthcare should be made by her and her medical professional. The state need not play a role other than insuring access to health care.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
While I do not think Question 1 is perfect in its current form, I support it and will vote yes. Maine is the oldest state in the nation. Maine, as does our country, has a broken health care system. We need radical changes. People should have the option of aging in home when possible because it is good for them and the economy. Nursing home care expenses far exceed targeted home care supports. Sometimes a referendum is necessary to prod the legislature to do what is right. See marriage equality.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I support rank choice voting in state elections because that is what Maine voters have said they want. It is their call. I am not certain if an amendment to our constitution is needed to make the will of the voters law.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
For businesses to expand in Maine or relocate to Maine, we must have an available work force with the skills necessary for that business. I support making the Technical Centers and Community Colleges available to more students and working with private sector businesses to ensure their skill needs are met.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Implementing this referendum requires a significant long-term funding source. This would have been simpler if the referendum question included the funding source. Do the voters who approved this expansion expect it to be paid for by reducing funding to other programs, raising sales taxes, raising income taxes?
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare Benefit programs are put in place to provide assistance for those in need. Each comes with qualification guidelines and expectations for use. If data shows the benefits are being used for illegal activities or requirements are not being met, then the Program may need to be reformed to correct the problems.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
No, maintain current process for now.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
I support the current Federal and State tax incentives for people who want to install renewable energy technologies on their homes and property.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I would support the availability of more education and guidance on the alternatives to abortion.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against. The $300 million income tax increase would make us a less attractive State for people to live and work. The private Board created to spend these funds would be subject to little, if any, public accountability. Clearly there are many needs in this area, but we must get all the interested parties together at the table to create legislation to resolve these issues.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. I want to listen to all the candidates and vote for the one who best reflects my priorities and values.
House District 85: (Map) Aug\"
219," AUGUSTA - Transportation officials unveiled a draft 20-year plan Tuesday that focuses on investment in key corridors that are tied to economic growth.\ The draft plan outlines $10.6 billion in improvements for roads, bridges, rails, ports and air service.\ Sounding a familiar theme, Department of Transportation officials noted their efforts remain constrained by funding shortfalls, projected to reach $4 billion over the next 20 years if revenue sources remain the same.\ That gap exists even though DOT has deferred about $200 million in work since 2005, when road and bridge construction costs began to spike by as much as 35 percent annually.\ On highways, the 20-year plan would dedicate:\ . $220 million to improve safety, mostly by upgrading intersections, curves, lights and signs.\ . $1 billion on the state's interstate system, which ranges in age from 20 to 50 years.\ . $682 million on arterial highway modernization, including about 100 miles of rural substandard sections.\ . $1.8 billion for secondary highway modernization.\ . $1.6 billion in maintenance paving.\ . $1 billion in congestion management, including work on I-295.\ The plan also shows $2 billion invested in bridge replacement. DOT manages 2,604 bridges, and according to the plan, 288 are at risk of posting, reposting at a lower speed, or closing within 10 years.\ To achieve the expected 80-year life span of a bridge, about 32 should be replaced annually, the report states.\ Transportation Commissioner David Cole said Tuesday the plan considered comments from the state's regional transportation councils and metropolitan planning organizations.\ Some of the goals suggested by those groups are:\ . Replacing and widening the bridge over the Stillwater River in Old Town.\ . Designing and constructing a new I-95-I-395 interchange.\ . Improving the I-95 corridor in Penobscot County.\ . Increasing mobility and safety along coastal U.S. Route 1 in Hancock and Washington counties.\ . Developing the Acadia Gateway Center in Trenton.\ . Extending passenger rail service from Portland to Brunswick.\ . Improving commuter routes into Augusta (Routes 201 and 202).\ . Improving heavy haul truck routes in central Maine such as Route 2, 15, 43 and 135.\ In his preface to the report, Cole notes the DOT aims to ""preserve communities, protect our environment and ensure that what is special about Maine is enhanced.""\ The draft plan also opens the can of worms that is funding for highways, bridges and other transportation initiatives.\ Much of the state's revenue for that work now comes from the 26.8 cents per gallon gas tax and the 27.9 cent per gallon diesel fuel tax. As people drive less in response to higher gas prices, and as they buy more gas-efficient vehicles, fuel tax revenues have not kept pace with DOT needs.\ The report lists possibilities for addressing declining revenues such as increasing gas taxes, expanding tolls where appropriate, mileage-based fees, and various borrowing strategies.\ DOT will host meetings on its draft 20-year plan to solicit comment before publishing the final plan. These meetings will be held in:\ . Bangor, 11 a.m.-2 p.m. Tuesday, April 17, at the Eastern Maine Development Corp. boardroom, 40 Harlow St.\ . Ellsworth, 7-9 p.m. Monday, May 7, City Hall auditorium.\ . Machias, 7:30-9 a.m. Thursday, May 10, Blue Bird Restaurant.\ . Caribou, 7-9 p.m. Tuesday, May 15, Northern Maine Development Committee, 11 Presque Isle Road.\ The complete draft plan, titled ""Connecting Maine,"" will be posted next week at: www.mainedot.gov."

Michael Nadeau (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Until the Maine state government creates a long-term plan for taxes, utilities, energy, referendum funding, education goals, specialty training programs and streamlining/ vetting the bills introduced for legislation, we can expect what we are getting. We can do better. Revamping from the top.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\As a part of a comprehensive plan with priorities in place, the Legislature should review all spending, identify needs and obligations, and change the budgeting process to reward departments that return unused funds. A mechanism should be in place to deal with unfunded mandates from referendums like ranked choice voting and expanded Medicaid expansion. There is only so much in the budget. Which programs do you fund?\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\It means if a person need help, help is available until that person is ready to resume work. It doesn't become a way of life. The money is spent on necessities, not luxuries. The recipient must be looking for work. It should not be used for vacations or bail. It should be used by recipient only. There should be immediate suspension and lifetime revocation for abusers.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Again, we are looking at this as reactive instead of proactive. When the state is always spending beyond its budget, we are saddled with debt. Planning, saving, and identifying priorities will give us the information needed to fund immediate and future needs. Annual borrowing should be reduced and not be used as an open credit card.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I am in favor of renewable energy (solar, wind, etc.) but they need to be self-efficient, not taxpayer funded. They also need to be part of a statewide plan to reduce energy costs.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am Pro-Life, and until I see the details on laws or proposed laws if any, I will not speculate.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\No on One. I would much rather expand home care services with the home care groups that are already doing it now. These groups have oversight, accountability, HIPPA certification and are on the road already. Expanding what we already have is the best option.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No, one person, one vote. This process complicates voting and costs taxpayers an additional $300,000 above original costs. The costs of this could have gone to expanding home care for seniors.\Senate District 2\Michael Carpenter (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Certainly workforce development is now and will continue to be a problem. We don't have enough people trained in the skills of the 21st century. The legislature will need to continue to provide resources to the post-secondary education facilities of the State, in particular the Community College system.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Currently, there is sufficient money in the budget to implement the expansion and,going forward we will need to budget for the costs.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\We need to continue to fine tune these programs so that able-bodied adults have to work when they can.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I believe that we have to continue to look at all options but that the gas tax should be in the mix. Our infrastructure is in need of serious attention over the next few years.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I believe that there should be an exploration of expanded incentives for alternative energy sources. Renewables need to be a growing piece of our energy mix.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\As long as Roe continues to be the controlling law state legislatures are somewhat hampered in making changes.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Probably voting No. I have read the underlying bill and it is quite complex. While I don't practice health care law, I do have some privacy concerns.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Given that it seemed to have to work well in the primary election and that the voters have twice supported it, I would support a Constitutional amendment.\Karen Ann Reynolds (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\High taxes and a limited ""skills ready"" workforce are factors keeping companies from setting up shop or expanding in Maine. Eliminating barriers will mean continued, improved communication with investors and collaborating with all schools ( high school and beyond) so that everyone wins-- best training to produce best workers for the best jobs. I support work ready education and tax reform measures to make Maine attractive to live, work and play.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\As a fiscally responsible conservative, Medicaid expansion must be funded in a way that doesn't hurt our hospitals or our most vulnerable. We need our local hospitals open to serve our population and they cannot continue to be uncompensated for that care. Maine is a poor state. I do not see how Expansion can go forward unless it has a true identifiable funding source.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Compassion, coupled with common sense. Welfare reform means helping those who are struggling through tough times, while ensuring it is not being abused. Welfare benefits are meant to be temporary. Meaningful work is the objective and cure to most social ills.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Infrastructure is a cost of doing business in Maine. A strategic plan for funding is crucial for advancing future growth. We must continue to study how other states are successfully funding it, other than simply borrowing.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I like our innovative spirit and I'm confident that these industries will continue to grow without further incentives.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am a Pro-Life candidate and believe that Maine's current law of ( restricting) public funding for abortions ONLY in the cases of life endangerment, rape or incest is reasonable.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting NO. It is another expensive, misleading and out of state backed referendum. Like most of these ""tax hike"" initiatives, it does not appear to be well thought out for the people or future of Maine.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No. I vote for the person, not the party, and not the process.\Senate District 3\Jeffrey B Johnson (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Several things need to be addressed simultaneously. We need to create much better access to affordable training and skill development to fill good paying jobs that are available right now in parts of the State. Rural Maine is really lagging behind in the creation of good paying jobs. We need to build out our broadband infrastructure to make rural parts of the State, like many of the areas in State Senate district 3, able to compete in a global market.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\There is a lot of waste in our Medicaid programs that needs to be addressed, most certainly in the layers of administration and unnecessary regulatory red tape that doesn't improve outcomes. I've owned and run companies that do business with Maine Medicaid for the past thirty years. Strong, common sense leadership demanding very attainable efficiencies coupled with federal dollars will create long term sustainable funding.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\We all want people to have the help they truly need. There is a small percentage of people that have short term challenges that receive benefits too long. Instead of giving someone a hand up, that small group receives help long term. That's wrong. And there are people who truly need services now that can't access them. That's wrong too. We desperately need more business sense in managing these multi billion dollar programs and much less political fighting.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\We absolutely need to revisit the way we fund our infrastructure. One clear option that other states and communities has leveraged much more than Maine is mini bonds. Mini bonds allow for local private and public investment at lower interest rate payments for those communities. It allows for more local control as to what infrastructure needs to be upgraded, and who is going to be hired to do the work. Local control. Lower cost. We should be accessing infrastructure funds much more this way.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes, we should expand incentives in thoughtful, smart ways. As a state we need to reduce our carbon footprint and do everything we can to have our Maine look and feel to our kids and grandkids the we we experience it. We need an aggressive sustainable energy plan put together by nonpartisan experts. And we need good leadership to work that plan. Strategic planning and good implementation of the plan happens everyday in my businesses. Mainers deserve at least as much.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Personally I oppose abortion. I can't imagine advising anyone in my family to have an abortion if they were to ask my opinion. However, I feel very strongly that it is the right of a woman to decide what is right for her. I oppose the government intervening in that decision by making abortions illegal. I don't think access should be loosened or restricted. Our laws should remain as they are.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I'll be voting against it. We all want people to stay in their homes as long as possible. But Question 1 creates an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and higher taxes.The way to fund in-home supports is to cut the bureaucratic waste within DHHS, Dept of Education, and Medicaid. Ask someone who works in one of those state agencies about waste they see. I've been doing business with those state agencies for thirty years. I see it everyday. It's time for some common sense business decisions\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do not support a constitutional amendment. The people have spoken via referendum and we now have ranked choice voting for some elections. I say let's continue to try it and see how it works. Time will tell Maine voters if we like ranked choice voting or not. If we like it then we can talk about an amendment; if not then we repeal it. We have some time.\Bradlee T. Farrin (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Lack of a skilled workforce shortage is a huge barrier for economic development. Businesses looking to relocate or expand in Maine are discouraged from doing so because finding the man power is a struggle. That is why I am such a supporter of expanding access to the trades in Maine's schools. Maine needs a skilled workforce in order to encourage development and create a state where our young people can live, work and raise a family.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Medicaid expansion is now law, but we need to fund it in a responsible manner. Maine has expanded Medicaid before, and it led to a massive debt owed to our hospitals. Nobody wants to repeat the mistakes of the past. I also don't want to see those on wait lists for services waiting even longer because funds have been redistributed to Medicaid expansion. We need to find a way to pay for Medicaid expansion so that it does what is was meant to do, help people.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform means making common sense changes to programs to ensure that those who need them have access to them, and that the money is used in the most effective ways possible. Welfare is meant to be a hand up, not a hand out. I believe that it should be used when those landing on hard times need help, but it should not be a long term solution for people. I also believe there should be a pathway from getting assistance to independence, instead of all or nothing.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Bonding is certainly not the preferred method to pay for our roads and bridges. With cars becoming more fuel efficient, we have seen revenue from the gas tax decline. I served on the Transportation Committee in the 127th Legislature and I have a couple of ideas to address this problem. We don't have a revenue problem in Augusta, we have a spending problem. For starters we need to ensure that money intended for transportation is not diverted to the general fund.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\No. The cost of renewable energy technologies have deceased dramatically. Solar and wind have a place in Maine's energy portfolio, because a diverse portfolio is a strong one, but I think that those energy sources can now compete on their own without being subsidized.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I think that this issue has largely been addressed by the Supreme Court and is a Federal issue. I don't intend to introduce legislation concerning this topic.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting no, for a number of reasons. It is a bad idea for Maine. This is another example of out of state interest trying to force bad policy on Maine Citizens through the referendum process. As Legislators and Voters we need to fix this process to outside money from influencing how we live our lives.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do not. I have never been a supporter of this voting method. I think that it is more costly, and confusing to voters. I believe in one person, one vote.\Senate District 4\Paul T. Davis Sr. (R) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\I have talked to many local businesses small and large, the cost of energy, high taxes and regulations are all job killers.\The State of Maine needs to look hard at regulations that curtail growth. With a new administration Maine also needs to look hard at every program in state government to make sure every dollar is being spent wisely.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I think the tobacco settlement money should be used for this, along with any surplus we have. if this is not possible than the legislature needs to find on going funding without raising taxes.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\To me this means a tighten up of the benefits to those getting welfare. Welfare needs to be available only to the truly needy.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes it should. I think we should look to the general fund to help provide funding for our roads and bridges. Also the sales tax paid on tires, batteries, vehicle parts should go to the roads and bridges. State government should never be allowed to raid the transportation fund.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I support solar power. However I do not support wind power. Maine should not be a pass through state to bring energy to other states. Maine must receive benefits from energy coming through Maine.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am pro life.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I oppose question one. . I think to have such a high income tax rate in the tax bracket it is aimed at would hurt the state by driving the folks that create jobs from Maine and keep them from coming to Maine. .\Question one has no income restrictions. Wealthy folks can receive benefits from this idea. I think we should do all we can for the elderly but this is not the way.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No. I would support a runoff election between the top two candidates. I think rank choice is far to confusing for most people.\Susan D. Mackey Andrews (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Access to healthcare insurance is the biggest barrier to economic growth and sustainability. Costs are prohibitive; access is limited while the need for healthcare is widespread. Many Mainers work more than one job to cover healthcare costs or defer retirement to keep their healthcare. Expanding Medicaid access is a partial solution, coupled with a long term approach that employs a more universal approach to healthcare emphasizing prevention and early access to comprehensive care.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Access to meaningful, affordable healthcare is the #1 priority for Maine voters. Let's fund expansion with state surplus dollars and ensure responsible, future funding to include an overhaul of Maine's Medicaid program to include participant fees, co-pays and deductibles based upon ability to pay as well as recognition of the savings realized from improved health and worker participation and productivity.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Poverty has always existed, but it has become deeper and more divisive. Today's ""welfare reform"" means limiting access, which has exacerbated the ""us and them"" argument, unfairly punishing many people who legitimately need our help. To me, responsible welfare reform views assistance as temporary but also, as comprehensive – beyond the basics. It should include addressing the whole person and his/her needs in planning and service delivery as well as education, the great equalizer.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes, we should examine alternative ways to fund our roads and bridges that are within the state's budget and stop relying on bonds. The latter approach leaves investment in our infrastructure less strategic, integrated and long-term. There should be some relationship to ""use"" as a factor when assigning cost, and we need to recognize the need for equal investment in our rural and urban infrastructures.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Definitely yes. Solar in particular is an incredibly viable solution to stem the use of fossil fuels and to maintaining our clean environment. Maine should focus on these alternatives with balance, recognizing the importance of our pristine lands within the context of our growing tourism industry. There surely is a balance we can strike here, putting the values of Mainers first, protecting our lands while moving towards increased energy independence for our state.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support maintaining the current Maine law protecting a woman's right to access comprehensive healthcare. More unintended pregnancies are prevented through comprehensive women's healthcare programs, including access to birth control and cancer prevention/detection/treatment. If a woman makes the difficult decision to terminate a pregnancy, it should be a safe and medically available procedure.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I support the concept of Question 1 because I know too many families forced into poverty by caring for an aged parent or child with life-long disabilities. Our state budget, like our personal budget, is a statement of our values and if home-care is one of our values, we should ALL participate in financing this. I prefer home-care to be a state funded initiative rather than the current proposal, and will vote against Question 1 for this reason alone.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes, I do support a constitutional amendment to ensure ranked choice voting in all Maine elections. I believe that ranked choice voting more accurately reflects the vote of the majority and provides more choices to voters beyond the two party system.\Senate District 5\James F. Dill (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\""Keep & attract young folks to work, buy homes & raise families\Student loan debt relief, entice young people to work & live here for at least 5 years in exchange for debt reduction\Better access to quality childcare & support businesses by raising reimbursement rates for childcare providers for eligible working families\Support bonds for post-secondary education to have a system where Mainers can gain more skills and knowledge\Modernize our broadband network, allowing access to the world\[image id=""2708687"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Estimates from the Legislature's Office of Fiscal and Program Review, is that there is funding in the state MaineCare accounts to pay the State's share of the costs of coverage for the expansion population until the final quarter of FY19. The Legislature passed a bill, LD 837, which prepared us for the ramp-up of enrollees, but was vetoed by funding additional positions at DHHS and updated computer technology. This bill needs to be reintroduced next session.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\The term welfare reform means finding the correct balance between making sure our fellow Mainers have a safety net in place for hard times and ensuring that taxpayer dollars are not allocated to those who don't need them, or would use them fraudulently. I support restrictions on welfare that disallow the money to be used for lottery tickets, cigarettes, and other goods that are not central to Mainers' health. I support limits on public assistance that remove the incentive for folks to seek work.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Perfectly, Maine would have money in its Highway Fund to pay for all infrastructure improvements. I don't want to incur debt, but I worry more about our roads and bridges. A recent report from the Am. Soc. of Civil Engineers gave Maine a C- overall, and a D for our road quality. Many alternative funding sources would amount to another tax, either on drivers' licenses, hybrid cars, or registrations. I do not want to burden Mainers with more tax. I am also open to public/private partnerships.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Renewable, sustainable forms of energy are potentially cheaper, better for the environment, and create jobs. I absolutely support the state incentivizing people to explore alternative energy sources.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I think the laws are right where they should be. This gives individuals the right to choose, hopefully after seeking guidance from resources they trust.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Probably no. Mainers are already taxed too much, and one of my main objectives in the Legislature has been to reduce property taxes. The Legislature is elected to appropriate existing tax revenue consistent with our shared priorities. I can't support higher taxes, when the state is trying to lure people here.\I believe our seniors are the backbone of our communities and I should have the best care possible. I sponsored a bill to fund senior assisted living facilities and it easily passed.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes, I have consistently voted for a constitutional amendment in the Senate and plan to continue to do so. The voters approved it through a referendum and since it is in conflict with the State Constitution, it needs to be fixed.\Maia Dendinger (U)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\The biggest barrier to economic development is capitalism- a system based on the exploitation of workers & the environment to make profits for the 1%. We need to transition to a socialist economy, consisting of worker cooperatives, owned and democratically self-managed by the workers, and committed to meeting community needs. We must enact policies that support worker ownership, and establish a job guarantee program that provides communities with resources to put people to work at a living wage.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\It is not a question of whether the financial resources are there, but rather how they are apportioned. If there was funding to give $30 million to General Dynamics, there is money to ensure that sick Mainers receive the care they need. I support Maine Allcare & the fight for universal healthcare in Maine. Because Mainers already pay for healthcare (whether out-of-pocket or in the form of insurance premiums & co-pays) even a commensurate tax increase would ultimately save Mainers' money.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\I believe we must protect and boster our social service programs. I support food assistance on demand for anyone in need, without invasive testing and wasteful bureaucracy. Every human being should be provided equal access to the necessities of life, including nutritious food, clean water, housing, education, healthcare, and meaningful work.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\We must move away from regressive policies such as the gas tax, which disportionately affects the poor and working class who can least afford to pay such taxes, and instead we must continue to explore alternative sources of funding.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Transitioning to renewable energy is necessary if we want to prevent the worst effects of global warming. Researchers have shown that it is possible to achieve 100% renewable energy in Maine by 2050, creating thousands of jobs in the process. Energy production should be in the hands of communities, not big business. That's why I support the creation of community-owned energy cooperatives as the basis of a renewable future.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I believe abortion should be free and accessible for anyone who needs those services.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting for the home-care citizen initiative because I believe all Mainers deserve access to necessary care. In fact, I believe that this initiative does not go far enough; in addition to providing care for the elderly and disabled, we must also provide childcare for all who need it. Too often, working-class women are forced to provide care-work without pay; we must ensure that care providers are treated fairly and also that elderly and disabled Mainer have access to the care they need.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\As a socialist, I am firmly committed to the principle of direct democracy and maine's ballot initiative process. If I am elected as a state senator, I will support any and all citizen initiatives passed by the people of Maine. I also support ranked-choice voting in particular because because it creates space for candidates outside of the two-party system and because I believe we need more democracy and more choice, not less.\Debbi Perkins (R)\Did not respond.\Senate District 6\Marianne Moore (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\I believe we need to take a comprehensive look at our workforce and ensure that Mainers have the skills needed for today's jobs. I know there are many jobs available that require technical skills our young people lack. We have to encourage more of them to learn the trades. We also have to do more to attract industry to Maine.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The people have spoken on this issue, and I do believe we need to expand Medicaid. But we need to find a reliable funding source for it. That's going to require rolling up our sleeves and getting creative. Perhaps tapping the tobacco settlement fund would be a viable option.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\I believe we need to take a look at the system, as a whole, and come to a conclusion about who should and shouldn't be on welfare. Clearly, we need to care for the most needy among us. For able-bodied adults, it should not be a way of life. I also believe there should be a work requirement for able-bodied citizens receiving welfare as part of an ongoing effort to move them away from the welfare system and into the workforce.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I would support some borrowing to address needs with our infrastructure and higher education.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I support the expansion of renewable energies in Maine. But as a Washington County resident, I am concerned about offshore wind development. If we are going to pursue these projects, we have to ensure they do not interfere with marine life and our fishing industry which is so important to our economy.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am pro-choice and do not favor additional restrictions, although this is, for the most part, a federal issue.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will not vote for Question 1, and I encourage everyone in Maine to vote no. There are multiple problems with this proposal, the biggest being the costs. The way I understand it, there are no means tests or residency requirements for those who would benefit from passage of this ill-conceived idea. People I've been meeting with while campaigning are very confused about this proposal.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do not support ranked-choice voting. It's very confusing, and frankly, unnecessary. We will be asking Maine citizens to use two different voting systems when they go to the polls on November 6. I think this is wrong.\Christina M. Therrien (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Lack of adequate infrastructure. Invest more in transportation, broadband expansion, support airport, rail, and shipping improvements\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Maine people have supported the expansion and it should be funded. To determine the best way to fund the expansion would require a full review of what is currently being funded and where the revenues are being appropriated towards the operation of current government. I don't think it is wise to propose where the funds should come from without looking at the whole picture.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform means to evaluate all social programs currently being provided and look for efficiencies, duplication of services, and fraudulent activity, whether within the state or amongst the program recipients. It can be a chance to provide a better service to those in need and while looking for beneficial savings.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes, infrastructure is a vital component of the state and improvements must be made if Maine wants to continue to compete in the global economy. Businesses must have internet access and the ability to move goods/services in a cost effective manner. I am willing to consider different revenue sources to improve infrastructure.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. We should be working to reduce our carbon footprint and negative impact on the planet.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Neither at this time. I am pro choice.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\For. It is more cost effective to keep citizens in their homes whenever possible and most people want to be at home and not in nursing facilities. We must pay people who do this work a fair wage.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. I believe that whoever serves the people should have the majority of the vote.\Senate District 7\Louie Luchini (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Among the biggest challenges to our economy: building our workforce, keeping/attracting young people in Maine, and lowering healthcare costs. We must develop a 21st century economy that creates good-paying jobs with benefits. We can continue investments in R&D and commercialization, support small business and start-ups, and expand broadband to all parts of Maine. Increased investments in pre-k to adult education will help prepare our workforce, making licenses/credentials more accessible.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Maine people have approved Medicaid expansion and it's the Legislature's responsibility to budget for it. Expansion will help rural hospitals by reducing the enormous financial burden of charity care, which forces hospitals to shift the cost to those with private insurance, or balance their budgets by making job cuts. The legislature needs to prioritize expansion in the biennial budget process. A potential source of funding is the millions received annually by Maine's liquor contract.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Social services programs should help Mainers that are truly in need. Reforms should focus on a more efficient delivery of services, while rooting out any welfare fraud. Removing the ""cliff effect"" will allow people to ease off the programs. Our social services programs must focus on lifting families out of poverty, helping them find work and healthcare, so they can eventually leave the programs entirely.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maine needs to make serious investments to improve our roads and bridges. Bonding is an option for investing in infrastructure, but we should also make larger investments through the biennial budget process, maximizing federal match dollars.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Maine should encourage and incentivize the use of renewable energy, such as hydropower, solar, tidal, wind, and biomass. Not only will this help our environment, but it will create jobs and increase economic investments in Maine. We should be leaders in off-shore wind, utilizing UMaine's research. Biomass continues to help our struggling forestry/logging industries. Maine should incentivize conservation of energy by weatherizing homes and using more efficient sources of heat, like heat pumps.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I believe current law is sufficient, and I don't believe politicians should make personal health care decisions for women.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I have not taken a position on Question 1 yet.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I have supported a constitutional amendment allowing RCV in all Maine elections.\Richard S. Malaby (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Long term our biggest barrier is high costs- for taxes, electricity and regulations.\Short term largest barrier is need for additional workforce.\Legislature could try to lower taxes and energy costs and promote workforce development while making the state more business friendly.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Funding should be included in the budget if it is a priority. Frankly, the lack of skilled, trained eligibility specialists is an immediate impediment to expansion. The department needs 27 people to achieve normal case loads for specialists (700 cases per staffer). We would need an additional 100 to expand by 70,000. This is a complex job, requiring knowledge of Federal law, significant computer skills and a great deal of training. I just do not see it happening quickly.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\It has a variety of meanings but for the most part people tend to think of it as eligibility for state paid services.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. While I do not favor a blanket increase in the tax, I could see increasing it if the price of oil falls below a certain benchmark figure-say $2.00 a gallon statewide wholesale. Conversely if the wholesale price stays above that, then I would eliminate the increase in the taxes. I suggest a modest tax increase if that price is below the benchmark.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I have no problem with renewables, but I do not think the state should be subsidizing investments that do not make economic sense.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Neither\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will vote No-it is a sham. Yet another poorly crafted referendum.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No-I can not see the need for a constitutional amendment for this issue.\Senate District 8\Kimberley Rosen (R) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\The popular quote ""demographics is destiny"" applies to Maine's economy. Employers are wrestling with the challenge of dwindling numbers of working age people. The Legislature should re-design all economic incentives to restrict the benefits to rewarding job creation, attraction and retention, with preference to small Maine based businesses. Also, voters must soundly reject ballot questions like Question 1that drastically increase Maine state tax rates.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Dedicate a portion of the revenue from the sale of liquor, tobacco products and marijuana to fund the Medicaid eligibility expansion as well as providing an increase of resources targeted to add more addiction treatment and recovery services.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Establish as our top priority the safety net of services for children, the elderly in need and people with disabilities as well as people designated as class members in negotiated consent decree settlements. Services for people looking for temporary support should be tailored to individual circumstances and transitioning off these services should be tiered step by step rather than an abrupt all or nothing cliff.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Borrowing adds interest expense to the overall cost of projects. The additional public funding required to retire the debt results in fewer miles of highway improved. Prudent adjustments to the gas tax will generate direct funding for transportation projects and is preferable to incurring costs associated with heavy borrowing, providing the public and overall economy more bang for the buck. Utilizing debt should be reserved for extraordinary circumstances that require maximum flexibility.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Incentives should be equalized across all renewables including hydro, solar, wind, tidal and geothermal. The current overall level of incentives to encourage investment in renewable energy sources is sufficient but the state should apply them evenly and fairly rather than pitting winners against losers.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Current state laws are appropriate.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting No on Question 1. The 30 pages of new law in this proposal will hurt not help Maine people and damage the Maine economy. It includes the largest tax increase on Maine working households in the history of our state. It creates a shadow-government board with no direct accountability to the taxpayers of Maine. The proposed new law violates personal medical privacy and violates the Maine Constitution.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I did not support the ranked-choice voting experiment. I think a run-off process is preferable because voters would easily understand the choices before them. However, the voters have decided the question and rank-choice voting is the law we must operate under. Therefore as Senator I respect that outcome and support sending out for voter approval the necessary constitutional fix required to implement the law.\Beverly B. Uhlenhake (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Roads, rail, and waterways used to be the route for goods and services to be exported out of the state of Maine. Now, much of that commerce exchange happens fully or at least in part over the internet. We have the Three Ring Binder developed; we need to pull the stakeholders together, fund it, and implement it. This is especially important in rural Maine.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\First, we need to understand that if we don't fund Medicaid expansion, we'll need to soon bail out our hospitals who are struggling due to the number of uninsured seeking treatment. Once we realize that we are paying for it no matter what we do, the money will be much less painful to find.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\As I've talked with Mainers in this district throughout the campaign, not a person expressed a desire to completely eliminate welfare. We all agree that we need a safety net. That safety net must be accessible, fair, and easy to understand. It also must be appropriate in the amount of assistance available and safeguards against abuse.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\On many other issues, we hear that those that use the service should pay for the service. At some point, we need to get over our fear of a gas tax increase. We are paying for infrastructure whether it be through bonds or through an increased gas tax. It's best coming from those who use it.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\The State of Maine should invest in the research and development to make these technologies more accessible and affordable to the general public. This is exactly the public/private partnership that needs to be negotiated.\We also need to invest in weatherization projects throughout Maine to address the other side of the energy equation. We need to reduce the use, but we can't do that as heat pours out through the cracks of some of the oldest housing stock in the nation.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I had a great-uncle who happened to be a Catholic missionary priest in Peru most of his life. At the end of his days, he expressed his belief to my grandmother that abortion would happen no matter the legality of it. It is our job to help women stay safe in the process, and we can't do that in an unregulated market.\I'm also of the firm belief that we need to do all we can to prevent abortions - access to education, reproductive healthcare and birth control are vitally important.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\We know that helping the elderly stay in their homes for as long as possible is more effective, more efficient, and more dignified than the alternatives. But tax reform via referendum is a bad idea. I'll be voting against this referendum, but I will work toward better options for home care when I get to Augusta.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. I agree with the League of Women Voters (who originally presented this idea in the early 00s) that ranked choice voting leads to more civil campaigns and less need for strategic voting. Ranked choice voting really does offer more choice and more voice to voters.\Senate District 9\Geoffrey Gratwick (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\There are several barriers to our economic development: a.) A broken, much-too-expensive health care system that is ruinous for both businesses and individuals. The Legislature must create a new structure that emphasizes prevention, accessibility, lower prices for medications, a public insurance option, and simplicity; b.) Lack of high-speed internet throughout Maine; c.) We need to keep our young people here with programs that create more and better jobs. Also, we need carefully designed tuition forgiveness programs, paid family medical leave, and pre-K programs.\[image id=""2708688"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\As a physician I have been a leader in the effort to expand Medicaid for the past eight years. Expansion will provide preventative and other medical care regardless of income for those it covers. Healthy citizens are productive citizens. States that expanded Medicaid after 2008 have done better economically than those that have not. Expanding Medicaid will bring $525 million in federal monies per year at a cost of $25-30 million of state funds.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\It means we have to fix the rules so public assistance is a safety net, not a generational life style. We need to modify the current 'cliff' which causes recipients to lose all major benefits (MaineCare, food stamps, housing) when their income increases by a small amount. Benefits should be tapered, not abruptly shut off. If people work more, they need to know they will take home more money and escape the cycle of dependency.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Our parents paid the taxes and fees which built the infrastructure that now supports our economy. We should make sure that we do the same for our kids. Roads, bridges, ports, clean water, sewers, and public facilities are essential. High speed internet, the economic highway of the future, has now joined this group of essential public services. Funding should come in part from user fees, in part from public funds but largely from bond issues.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\In a time of rapid technological change, the relative role of wind, solar, gas, renewables, and petroleum will clearly change. We do not know what Maine's energy mix will be even ten years from now. A constant is our need for conservation, weatherization and smart transportation: these must be as much a priority as the cost per kilowatt hour of electricity. The technology of energy storage is evolving and will undoubtedly lead us down new and currently unknown paths; Maine must study and rapidly adopt new options.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Abortion should be rare, safe and legal; it should not be a state-by-state option.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Caring for our elderly at home makes social and medical sense. Question #1 has introduced us to the idea of funded home care. Eventually we will look back and wonder why we did not adopt it earlier. I am concerned that, as currently written, the referendum has not been sufficiently vetted. There are too many unanswered questions and too many decisions will be left to the legislature; these decisions will invariably be resented. For this reason, I will not be voting for it. However, the issue is of paramount importance and should move forward; the legislature must iron out its details beforehand, with the benefit of widespread public input and hearings.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\James LaBrecque (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\As an inventor, technology specialist and businessman for 45 years, the lack of technically trained minds coupled with unrealistic expectations of the young is irresponsible. Legislators should relax their dominant push for liberal arts college and emphasize the critical need for technical training in a growing complex and technologically advanced society. These are the most lucrative jobs for many future graduates.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\This is another case where liberal extremists engage in a referendum to hijack and circumvent the legislative process of public hearings. Legislative public hearings with input from citizens and experts is paramount to fair and successful legislation. Bangor incumbent democrats voted together to deny our second district voters an equal voice in allowing such referenda on statewide ballots. How is this in our best interests? Their party votes were against their obligations to represent us.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare is a statutory obligation to meet the basic physical and material well-being of people in need. Welfare reform to me means, assuring that the limited resources for those truly needy are not abused by those gaming the system, like those using welfare money for gambling, booze, cigarettes and pot. Welfare reform should mean better identifying those people who are in most need for safe and healthy environments, not entertainment.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. Adjust the tax rate as needed to meet the needs. Let those who benefit most from the infrastructure contribute more in taxes for maintaining them. Too many private initiatives are allowed to greatly profit from special rules and back room deals whereby taxpayers end up paying more so others can profit. Increase transparency so that all citizens know what is going on. Revisit exorbitant contracts and renegotiate for more honest and fairness. We have seen President Trump do just that.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\No. I know of no other industry that has relied on pushing their product for 45 years through hundreds of special, state and federal laws still in effect today. No additional amount of new laws will result in fulfilling future promises anymore than they succeeded in past performance over the last 45 years. We know Angus King and others made millions from taking advantage of government subsidies. Why would we want to allow others to make millions more off tax and rate paying consumers?\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Any changes in legalized abortions must be addressed by the Supreme Court. Abortion laws are on the books. A woman has a right to choose. I would wish the baby and father had rights as well, but currently the baby in the womb has no voice. There is science regarding at what point a fetus is able to live without the mother. That is a discussion I would like to see advanced. I believe more education and information should be available to the public at large.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\No. Again, this is another case where out of state liberal extremists engaged in a referendum to hijack and circumvent the legislative process of public hearings. It is an additional 3.8% on certain Maine families. Maine's businesses and economy will be devastated by this tax, wait lists for home care will be out-of-control because there is no means test for this program, and the privacy of our seniors and disabled will be at risk. Why would anyone want to vote for this? I certainly will not.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No. One man, one vote. Majority rule. These are tenets of our electoral process and remains the ideal way to choose our elective legislators. RCV simply takes the majority vote, if not over 50%, and forces a second tally where a less capable candidate could steal the election. Leaders and legislators should win based upon their principals, character and experience, not on a popularity contest. This is not high school. RCV was not legally funded and a mistake favored by out of state interests\Senate District 10\Bill Lippincott (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Our educational system is not keeping up with the needs of our 21st century economy. We need to have quality education across the state, starting in early childhood; teachers are one of our most important assets, and we need to retain and attract good teachers to our state. We also need to have affordable vocational education and community colleges to train workers in the skills of the new economy.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The federal government still picks up 90% or more of Medicaid expansion, and the population that is covered by Medicaid expansion tends to be less expensive than others on Medicaid and Medicare.  Money from the $35 million tobacco settlement would take care of some of the costs; we should look at what other states are doing or planning, including surplus revenue in the general fund, tapping into tax revenues such liquor sales, making hospitals help, or cutting other Medicaid costs.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\We need to have a system that enables low-income single mothers a chance to escape the cycle of poverty. There has to be an incentive to take a job without putting a family in worse straits and a transition time before all benefits end. Affordable daycare and vocational training are essential components for any program to get people back into the workforce\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. As vehicles become more fuel efficient, gas taxes have not kept pace with the cost of maintaining roads and bridges. Two alternative methods should be looked at: the total yearly mileage of a vehicle, and the impact that class of vehicle has on the wear and tear of our roads. I don't foresee the elimination of bonds in the near future as a method of funding, but other sources should be examined\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\The state should encourage renewable energy. I agree with 97% of climate scientists that global warming is happening and the cause is an increase in greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. It's imperative for our children's future that we switch to renewable energy sources, such as solar power, and this presents an great opportunity for economic growth as demand for renewable energy increases in Maine and New England\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy, including a safe and legal abortion. I also recognize that health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and so also reduce the need for abortions\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\We need to support home care for seniors; Maine has an aging population and home care costs about half of what it would cost to house someone in a nursing home, with a much higher quality of life. But I don't support doing this by referendum; I would like to work on legislation that looks at different funding mechanisms, and looks at what other states are doing as models for what we can do in Maine\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Not at this time. I would like to see how well ranked-choice voting works in the US Senate and House races this fall before I would support a constitutional amendment\Stacey Guerin (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Work force shortage and lack of capital investment are two of our biggest barriers to improved economic growth. Attracting and retaining workers and capital investment can both be helped by lowering our taxes. We are the third highest state in the nation in tax burden. People and companies are comparison shopping on this costly issue.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\CNBC reports our tax burden is 11.02, the third highest in the nation. Clearly, we should not raise taxes to fund expansion. That leaves us with the question of where to reduce spending in other areas such as transportation and education, neither of which I wish to reduce, to pay for expansion. I want to be clear, Medicaid Expansion in no way affects our senior citizens. We must lower healthcare costs for ALL our citizens. More coverage choices would reduce everyone's healthcare costs.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Putting able-bodied people back to work and preserving our resources for the truly needy is welfare reform. Working gives people a sense accomplishment and a hopeful future. Mainers are known for being self-sufficient, welfare reform encourages that spirit. My own ""Casino Intercept"" reform bill has transferred nearly half a million dollars to overdue child support payments from parent's gambling winnings.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\The poor condition of our roads and bridges is a important issue to my constituents. I support moving away from our current funding shortfall system which leads to repeated borrowing with interest. One possible solution would be to apply the 150 million dollars collected in vehicle sales tax to the highway fund. This would give the transpiration department enough funds to virtually eliminate borrowing. Let's make the condition of our roads a priority!\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Renewable energy resources are important. I encourage both individual and corporate investment in these resources.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\When I was a young women, we were told that a developing fetus was a blob of tissue. Thanks to the advances in medical science, most of us have now seen a pregnancy sonogram. We now know it is a baby, capable of feeling pain. I am pro-life.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I join all of our gubernatorial candidates, regardless of party, in opposing Question 1. It is unconstitutional, extraordinarily expensive and unsustainable.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I believe in one person, one vote. I do not support discarding votes, thus denying the votes of Maine citizens. I also have serious concerns about the cost incurred and security of ballots being transferred away from local oversight.\Senate District 11\Erin Herbig (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Having met with more than 100 businesses in Waldo County this year, I can definitely say the greatest barrier to economic development is a trained workforce. The best employee in the world is a well trained Maine worker. The legislature needs to expand vocational education in high schools and the community college system, particularly in the trades, healthcare and the composite industry, so people can get the training they need without having to travel far from home.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The legislature has already approved a bipartisan proposal to fund this mandate which is awaiting the Governor's signature. Medicaid expansion is critical for the sustainability of our rural hospitals as well as the ability of our healthcare workforce to provide direct care to all Mainers.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\In Maine, we look out for our neighbors. That means having programs to support people who are struggling. It is also important to recognize the money used to fund these services comes from hardworking Maine families and we owe them the responsibility to make sure programs are run efficiently and effectively, and are available for those who are truly in need.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. Rather than borrowing money, routine road and bridge maintenance should be direct line items of the budget. Borrowing money for maintenance is not fiscally responsible and leaves rural Maine behind.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Mainers have always been independent and our energy policy should be too. Renewable energy diversifies our energy demands, and diversification is an important part of any investment strategy. We should encourage the expansion of these emerging technologies through tax and policy development.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Our current abortion laws carefully balance the rights and interests of all people. This is an important part of women's healthcare that should be decided between a woman and her healthcare provider.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\While I certainly agree with providing more support for Maine's seniors and Mainers with disabilities, I do not believe the funding mechanism outlined in this referendum is the best way to proceed. I am committed to working with my colleagues as chair of the Aging Caucus and other interested parties to find solutions to this issue that are right for every Mainer aging in the community they love.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Voters already approved this by referendum and the legislature has a responsibility to make sure it happens. I've heard from an overwhelming number of my constituents who support this measure and I am committed to seeing it through.\Jayne Crosby Giles (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Maine needs a skilled and ready workforce. Employers that I spoke to this past year often said that finding able employees is their biggest challenge. My ""Learn Here/Live Here"" program focuses on inspiring our next generation to launch their careers in Maine by supporting the following legislation: expand career & technical training across Maine, develop business & tech incubators to encourage entrepreneurs and connect rural Maine to better & faster broadband networks.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Medicaid expansion should be funded in the next biennial budget without gimmicks or ""one timeÄ funds. The state has a $7 billion biennial budget. The proposed $50 million expansion is .7% of the total budget which we should be able to afford. Additionally, Wellness incentives encouraging people to live healthier, quit smoking & increase exercise should be woven into our Medicaid program. Only 3% of national health care costs are spent on prevention & wellness. Healthier living will reduce costs.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\We all deserve a chance to be successful. Sometimes people need a helping hand due to illness, job loss or other unexpected event. Unless disabled or elderly, government assistance should be temporary with a goal that recipients become financially & emotionally secure. As example, Family Development Accounts (FDA) help low income families budget and save. Enrollees may receive a 4:1 ""match"" up to $5000 for education, home purchase or self- employment. More programs like FDAs help others succeed.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maine wisely pays off bonds for roads & bridges within 10 years. By repaying the debt relatively quickly, Maine stays ahead of the ""useful life"" for bridges & roadways. When I served on the Maine Legislature's Appropriations & Financial Affairs committee, we carefully watched how much debt the state carried in relation to the amount of General Fund revenues that the state receives. I recommend that this approach continue.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Investment in renewable energy technologies is smart investment for Maine's future. The legislature should encourage additional collaboration with our neighbor Canada that has made significant investment in clean, renewable energy sources. Investment in the businesses and organizations that provide clean energy should include a long range plan so that these enterprises become economically viable & sustainable over time.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I recommend no changes to the current abortion laws. Roe v Wade was decided in the 1970's and is accepted law. My utmost concem is for the pregnant woman and that she have access to proper care and support as she decides what is the best course for her family & her family.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\While I support ways to help families take care of their loved ones, I do not support Question 1 for several reasons. The revenue raised by the tax increase does not have adequate legislative oversight with the funds being managed by a separate board. Plus, the 3.8% tax hits many Mainers, including, doctors, dentists and nurses. These are medical professionals that we need, especially in rural Maine, to provide services. I recommend that the legislature take a closer look at the issue in 2019.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I support having the next legislature review the results of the 2018 elections before expanding RCV further. The June 12, 2018 primary was the first election in which RCV was used in Maine. After the primary, when visiting voters during my door-to-door campaign, I found that there is still a lot of confusion on how RCV works. More voter education is needed and evaluation of the 2018 before RCV is expanded.\Senate District 12\David Miramant (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\We need to embrace people from all over the world to fill our workforce with those willing to work. We also need to support broadband expansion in rural areas and continue to train our workforce for the jobs that are available. These are all happening, but not to the levels necessary to support the demands.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I have a bill request in the Revisor's Office to fund the Medicaid expansion at 50 million dollars. That will leverage the 500 million that the federal government will contribute thereby reducing the money wasted on high cost emergency room visits, or folks suffering with health issues that could be addressed. This is what the voters have decided and we need to make it happen. This should be expanded to include all Mainers and take our healthcare out of the hands of insurance companies.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\It means examining the use of the funds spent on our social programs to make sure they are being administered fairly and efficiently. We have the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability (OPEGA) that has that role in Maine government and I have supported funding in the past and will in the future. We have been doing that whenever we can and the results have shown that fraud and waste are a rare exception.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Definitely. This is a problem we wrestle with constantly on the Transportation Committee. It is such a waste of money to bond and pay interest when we know we are not meeting our needs. We have had several suggestions such as increasing the gas tax, a per mile charge at re-registration or a dedicated road use fee at registration. We need to bring all the ideas together and work it out in the committee since it is a challenge that will need broad agreement to pass.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes, The real costs of burning fossil fuels are being ignored and those emissions are having serious consequences on our health. There is abundant evidence of climate change and the the need to stop the pollution caused by combustive generation of power. We have endless offshore wind resources and unlimited sun for solar generation. The cost for solar has dropped by 60% in the last 8 years. The companies selling and installing solar are creating good paying jobs that can't leave the state.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\The law is in place and needs to be honored. No legislature should be allowed to undermine the law and make it unusable.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will continue to make the hard choices on the bills facing the Legislature and I will consider the question for myself when I go to the polls. This is certainly an issue we need to address in Maine and I am grateful that the referendum is giving attention to that need.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes, this is a way to have our choices considered throughout the voting process. It also creates a more civil campaign since the ranking of candidates seems to correlate with those who run more positive campaigns based on issues instead of attacks.\Wendy Pelletier (R)\Did not respond.\Senate District 13\Dana Dow (R) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Taxes are too high when comparing to other states. Too many businesses choose to go elsewhere instead of here. Proof: K-12 student population in our schools has decreased 25% since 1970 (240K to less than 180K) as young families have moved out of state.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I'm against dedicated funding sources. Full Legislature needs to address the same as any bill that compete for limited monies. The solutions must pass the Legislature and survive possible vetoes. This process will assure a stable outcome.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Basing the changes on a sliding monetary scale. Some jobs pay less than total benefit packages and at a certain income, welfare falls off the cliff. Needs a scale to encourage people to go back to work. Welfare is meant to be temporary.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Revisit the gas tax amount. Paying at the pump is better than borrowing and interest continually. Need to investigate per-mile registration fee for low-mileage cars. Everybody needs to pay their fair share.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Not a fan of ugly wind power. Should maintain research and development of solar power so that costs will eventually be reduced. Solar power locally also will reduce transmission costs compared to long distances from powerplants.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I would keep the same.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\NO. A very poorly worded initiative fraught with errors. May contain unconstitutional methods of obtaining personal health information. The administration of the funds is not responsible to the government or any legislative agency.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Undecided. Is it necessary? The first trial showed delayed time of picking winners at an extra expense, yet not one single change occurred from normal plurality method in use.\Laura A. Fortman (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\We need to invest in our people (education/skills) and our infrastructure (including broadband). We need to make sure that we expand our labor force by recruiting and retaining workers and investing in education at all levels, including vocational technical training. Also, we must invest in our roads, bridges, and broadband. This will create good paying jobs in the short term and provide dividends for business and Maine people for decades to come.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The Maine voters decisively supported Medicaid expansion. Implementing it needs to be a top priority. For every dollar that Maine spends on Medicaid expansion, we will receive nine dollars from the federal government. Medicaid expansion will not only support critical health care services, such as treating substance use disorder, it will shore up rural hospitals by reducing charity care and help create new jobs. If necessary, general fund revenue can be used to fund this expenditure.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\While knocking on doors I have had many conversations about ""welfare reform"". I heard repeatedly that most people don't mind helping out a neighbor when they are struggling. I also heard broad support for job training, child care and making work pay by expanding the EITC- things that improve self-sufficiency and reduce poverty. There was deep compassion for children, folks who are aging, or have a disability. Also, everyone agrees - people who abuse the system need to be held accountable.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I believe that Maine's current practices make sense to meet our immediate needs. Major investments in our roads and bridges are needed now and interest rates are low. However, more and more bonds and ever increasing gas taxes can't be our long term answer. Maine is not the only state grappling with this issue. This challenge calls out for a national blue ribbon commission to make recommendations. Failing that, Maine should undertake a study of our own.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I believe that energy policy needs to transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources. I believe that expanded incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies would be appropriate, but the nature and extent of those initiatives needs to be worked out in the legislative process. Finally, we need to improve efficiency and conservation efforts.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support the right of Maine women to access safe and legal abortion, as codified in the Maine Reproductive Privacy Act, and oppose any legislation that limits the right of a woman to make the best decision for her health.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I support the intent of Question 1. Lincoln County is the oldest county in Maine. Developing a long-term care system that meets the needs of older people so that all of us can maintain our independence as we age is critical. The legislature must address this and, if elected, it will be a top priority for me. However, I have concerns about several elements in Question 1 including the proposed funding mechanism and the governance structure. Therefore, I will not be voting for Question 1.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. Again, the voters of Maine have spoken clearly in two separate referenda that they want Ranked Choice Voting (RCV). It was used successfully in some primaries this year. Also, I believe that RCV can help reduce the negative rhetoric in campaigns which would be a very good thing.\Senate District 14\Shenna Bellows (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Infrastructure. Maine is a great place to live, but lack of infrastructure including high speed, reliable Internet, cell phone service and transportation can make it a tough place to start a business. We need to think boldly about building infrastructure, especially technology, as a recruitment tool to attract and retain young people to live and work in our state. Last session I proposed the creation of a public-private partnership to match private and public investments in broadband statewide.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Medicaid expansion is an incredible bargain. Maine will receive approximately $9 from the federal government for every $1 we spend at the state level to provide healthcare to an estimated 70,000 additional Mainers. Revenues are strong, and I'm proud that we have run a budget surplus. Now is exactly the time to invest some of that surplus in access to healthcare for more Mainers. In the long run, we may save money in overall healthcare costs when more people can access preventive care.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\To me, welfare reform means working in a collaborative and bipartisan way to ensure that the truly needy, especially our seniors, children and people with disabilities, have adequate food and housing and that everyone who can work does work.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. While Governor LePage's Administration has done an excellent job with maintaining our highways, our broader network of local roads and bridges needs more attention. I support restoring revenue sharing to provide more support to cities and towns for local road and bridge maintenance. Investing in transportation infrastructure is a huge economic development tool to create good jobs.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes, the state should expand incentives for renewable energy because it's good for the economy and good for the environment. Energy independence is crucial to growing our economy and protecting our state security.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Maine's laws are well established protecting the freedom of women to make their own decisions about abortion free from interference from the government. I support current Maine law protecting access to abortion and will do everything in my power to support women's access to a full range of reproductive healthcare.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will respect the will of the people, whatever they decide. I have serious concerns about the details including implementation and funding. My mom is a home healthcare nurse, so I know how important home healthcare is to Mainers, and I support the goal of the referendum, but I think the details need to be more carefully planned and thought through.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. The people of Maine have endorsed ranked choice voting at the ballot twice. Amending the Maine Constitution to return it to its original wording and allow ranked choice voting will ensure that the people are heard.\Matthew William Stone (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Our high energy and healthcare costs combined with an oppressive tax and regulatory structure make Maine an extremely difficult state to do business in. We need more legislators who have private sector experience and understand the economic struggles of both workers and small business owners. I worked for many years at a credit union, helping families and small businesses solve their financial problems. I'm the only candidate in this race who truly understands the economic challenges facing us.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\We need more adults in the room in order to solve this problem. Ideological considerations, whether conservative or progressive, need to be left at the door. Medicaid expansion is what voters wanted, so it's what they're going to get. The most pressing problem to solve is the long term viability of the program. There's no sugar-coating this: we're going to have to either raise revenues or cut other programs. Once elected, I'm going to listen carefully to my constituents on how to proceed.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform is about restoring trust in a vital and necessary public system. Even mere rumors of welfare fraud undermine social trust and hurt our communities. It's important that our assistance programs are focused on helping the truly needy of our native population: the disabled, single parents, poor elderly, etc. If able-bodied young adults fail to find direction in life, perhaps it's time the state provides it for them in the form of volunteerism or infrastructure projects.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. As the hybrid and electric car industry markets continue to grow, we must re-examine how we raise revenues in order to maintain our roads and bridges. I look forward to studying this issue further and exploring solutions with all stakeholders.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Maine is well-positioned to become a leader in renewable energy technologies, whether it's in the form of hydro, solar or offshore wind. If Denmark can get 42% of its energy from wind, then so can Maine. For too long, the fossil fuels industry has been able to suppress green energy initiatives through the buying of politicians. As a proud Clean Election candidate, I support expanding renewable energy options, as long as costs aren't passed on to ratepayers.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\While I believe Roe v. Wade is settled law, I sympathize with those who morally object to abortion on the basis that it's a violation of the sanctity of life. I strongly support the right to safe and legal abortion in the cases of rape, incest, life of the mother, certain genetic disorders, and even socioeconomic circumstances, but I also oppose taxpayer funding of abortion and ""abortion on request."" Even the UK, India, and Japan ban the latter. It's something to consider.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\No. The tax increase alone would drive middle-class working couples out of state and destroy small businesses, further shrinking our tax base and leading to even worse home care for our seniors. There are also potential HIPAA violations in Q1. Even Janet Mills has come out against this referendum. I was disappointed that my opponent declined to answer ""yes or no"" to this question in a survey with another paper. It's important that our political leaders give straight answers to these questions.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Maine's constitution is based on Massachusetts' constitution, which was written by John Adams. I believe he knew what he was doing when he wrote it. I will not support any amendment that meddles with the fundamentals of our representative democracy, including the grossly unconstitutional and so-called ""ranked choice voting.""\Senate District 15\Matthew Pouliot (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Finding skilled employees to fill positions is the primary concern I hear from employers in Maine. To grow our economy, we must ensure that Maine residents are trained with the skills needed for the jobs of today. Supporting career & technical education as well as programming at Maine's post-secondary institutions is necessary. We also must get serious about attracting people to Maine with incentives to reduce student loan debt through tax credits that match principal pay-down on loans.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Funding should be addressed through sustainable sources. We must make sure that we do not end up in a situation where we are not able to pay our bills like before.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Ensuring that welfare programs are utilized to help people get a hand up without becoming a long-term handout. Many people do not want to be on welfare, but need certain programs to get by in the short-term and that is ok. Yet for some able-bodied adults it has become a way of life to sustain themselves through social service programs and that is not ok. We must provide these individuals with valuable training and opportunities to improve their skills so they can become gainfully employed.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. As vehicles become more and more energy efficient, the outdated model of using the gas tax is not sustainable. Technology exists to track the amount of miles driven by a vehicle, we should look at implementing a pay-per-mile system as a more equitable way to fund our infrastructure.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes, as long as the incentives implemented do not burden ratepayers. Beyond the environmental imperative, it makes sense to use energy that is renewable because diversifying our energy portfolio provides an opportunity to become more and more energy independent. As technologies improve, the ability to reduce costs and dependence will prove to be beneficial for all Maine people.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I will continue to work to maintain the sanctity of human life.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Against. It is an imprudent way to fund the issue of home care in Maine.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No. I am hearing from many of my constituents that it is confusing and they feel it should not be in place for any elections.\Kellie Julia (D)\Did not respond.\Senate District 16\Scott W. Cyrway (R) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Maine is facing a workforce shortage. There are not enough workers for the jobs. Sadly so many young people are unable to lead productive lives due to the use of illegal drugs. I think we need to help our young people to make good choices in life so that they can help reduce the workforce shortage. Those good choices might be to avoid drugs or to take more technical courses, but the most important thing is that we encourage young people to stay in Maine and participate in the workforce.\[image id=""2708689"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Since the voters approved Medicaid expansion, we need to be sure that it is funded. In the past when expansions were funded, a huge debt to hospitals was created. Paying off the hospital debt is one of the best things the state has done recently. We need to make sure that Medicaid is expanded responsibly and that the people on the waiting list are served. We do not want to rob Peter to pay Paul.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\I have spent my life trying to help those in need and protect children. Welfare reform means ensuring we help those in need while also helping people help themselves with resources available. It means protecting all of Maine children, no matter their background. Welfare reform means making sure that help gets to those who really need it. When money is handed to those who could do without, we have less for those who are relying on these programs.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Bonding might not be the best way to fund our roads. Cars get much better gas mileage than they did in the past and that means that there isn't as much money coming in from the gas tax. We should look to see how other states have dealt with this to find a way that works for Maine. Our roads are so important that we need to be sure that the cost is fairly distributed.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Incentives are a great way to encourage starting industries. Solar and wind costs have gone down significantly and they need to find a way to be self-sustaining as they continue to be part of the plan for Maine's energy needs. We can't afford to jeopardize industries that are trying hard to bounce back.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Abortion is a federal issue that the Supreme Court has addressed. I am not planning to introduce any bills relating to it, though I am personally pro-life.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I am voting ""No"" on Question 1. Question 1 has the potential to force families and small businesses out of Maine due to high taxes. While it may be well intended, this bill wouldn't target Mainers who really need the help and would harm middle class families. Maine cannot afford to become the highest taxed state in the country. If re-elected, I will work with my colleagues to help make home health care affordable for Mainers in a responsible way.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do not support it. I believe in one person, one vote. The process has proven to be more expensive than expected as we saw in the primary process when there were over $300,000 in unfunded costs.\Karen Kusiak (D)\Did not respond.\Senate District 17\Jan Collins (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\The two most important factors affecting economic development are education and infrastructure. Broadband internet, cell service, well maintained roads and bridges; and skilled workers who can problem solve attract business investment in our communities. We need to insure proper funding for both. The legislature must assure that the state fulfill its obligations to fund schools. Tax cuts to the wealthiest Mainers during the last 8 years have prevented investments in rural Maine infrastructure.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Maine has missed out on over 1.5 billion dollars in federal investment and the 6000 medical jobs those funds would have generated. Every rural hospital in the state is struggling under deficits caused by the number of patients who lack health insurance. The legislature should review the three tax cuts it has made in the last six years to a very narrow segment of the population and consider new revenue streams as identified in the 2009 tax study.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Reform means better meeting the material and physical needs of Mainers. To do so, the economy in Maine must grow. To increase work force participation and maximize employment in an ever changing economy, we must have the ability to train and retrain. Job training for the unemployed and underemployed should be vigorous and targeted. It should be done in partnership with employers and should include supports that make it possible for parents of small children to benefit, such as, childcare.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maine should revisit how it funds infrastructure creating a reliable source of revenue to avoid the current poor condition of many of the state's roads and bridges. Revenues from the gas tax and/or bond initiatives, vary according to the strength of the economy. The need for road repair, however, is predictable. Infrastructure investments should be a regular part of the budget and funded from the general fund.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Incentives encouraging solar power should be expanded. Solar expansion boosts local economies. Solar provides local jobs in sales, installation and repair. It creates energy independence, slows the accumulation of greenhouse gasses, and provides clean energy. Solar energy can be stored. Wind power cannot be stored, adds few jobs to the local economy, and requires transmission lines. When placed on mountains, turbines require the mountain top be blasted.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I believe the current laws regarding abortions strike the right balance.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Maine is the oldest state in the country. We have a shortage of nurses, homecare workers, senior housing, and specialized alzheimer care facilities. We have known the current crisis was coming and have failed to plan appropriately. As I travel around the district I am struck by the number of people who are struggling with the health care needs of an aging parent or partner. They can no longer be ignored. Question 1 is flawed, elder care must be addressed by the legislature.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections. Ranked choice voting insures that the candidate with the broadest support wins. Candidates opposed by a majority of voters cannot win.\Russell Black (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Maine has made tremendous progress in the last eight years by lowering taxes and reducing regulations, but these remain among our biggest obstacles. We need to fix our referendum process so out of state groups are not bankrolling citizen initiatives with proposals that will raise our taxes. I would support legislation to require an equal number of signatures be gathered from both congressional districts in order to get a referendum question on the ballot.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The people have spoken on the issue of Medicaid expansion, but we need to find a sustainable funding source for it that doesn't rely on gimmicks and one time funding sources. We have to remember that we are expanding a welfare program to able-bodied adults. Meantime, Mainers with mental and developmental disabilities continue to languish on waitlists for services. I believe they and other truly needy Mainers need our attention.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare should be approached as a hand-up, not a hand-out, and not a way of life. The ""T"" in TANF is short for ""temporary."" There will always be people in our society who need help during tough times, but the goal should be to move them out of the system and help them become productive members of society.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I think we should revisit how we fund infrastructure projects and believe that when possible, we should fund such projects within the state budget instead of asking Maine taxpayers to borrow money.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Simply put, we need to support policies that bring the most cost-effective power to Maine for our businesses and homeowners. I support renewable energy sources such as solar, biomass and hydro when they are affordable, efficient, and make sense.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am pro-life.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\No. Rather than help those in need, Question 1 will create more waitlists for our elderly to languish on, while handing a large budget to a new bureaucracy with very little oversight from taxpayers. It would also make Maine the highest taxed state in the nation. All four of Maine's gubernatorial candidates oppose Question 1, and that should tell voters all they need to know about it.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I would not support this. Ranked-choice voting violates the principle of ""one person, one vote."" And while it seeks to have a candidate win by a ""majority,"" it's a redefined majority by a ""winner"" after some candidates are completely eliminated from the ballot. There's also the issue of the cost of ranked-choice voting, which was greatly underestimated during the June primary, forcing the Legislature to come up with more funds to pay for this convoluted voting scheme\Senate District 18\Lisa M. Keim (R) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Maine's increasing lack of skilled workforce has already begun to cause economic stagnation. We need to keep young people in Maine and attract more here. Marketing to young families with Maine connections and offering incentives is a good place to start. Also, our family structures continue to crumble. Strong families create productive members of society and healthy, vibrant communities. The state should sift all policies through this lens.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Everyone needs health care. We need to find a way to ensure Mainers have access to it, but government-run health care is not the way to go. Maine expanded Medicaid already, and it took years to pay off the hospitals because the state lacked the money to keep up with costs. The Legislature needs to find a stable source of income to pay for this before expansion moves forward. Most doctors and dentists feel it is essential that some amount of co-pay be required of every person.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Most of us, at one time or another, have fallen on hard times. Maine needs to have a safety net that helps people get back on their feet, but it cannot become a way of life. Our priorities should be helping our truly needy, such as the elderly and Mainers with disabilities. I support the recent reforms Republicans backed to crack down on welfare abuse in Maine.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I have been supportive of some borrowing to fund infrastructure projects and funding for our colleges. However, I believe we should limit our borrowing and find resources within our budget for other initiatives.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Maine needs affordable, reliable energy sources in order to compete with other states and attract businesses and families. I support renewable energy sources to the extent that they make sense, financially and environmentally. However, we cannot push higher electricity bills onto low and middle-class Maine ratepayers to subsidize renewable energy initiatives.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\All life is sacred. As medical science continues to advance, what was once considered only 'human tissue' may now be a viable birth. Maine would do well to make adoption a more accessible option for women who find themselves in this difficult situation.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\The four gubernatorial candidates and the Maine Chamber of Commerce, among many others, all recognize this is bad for Maine. It's a scam, and it would make Maine the highest-taxed state in the nation. There is plenty of Q 1 information in print and online. I urge readers to do their research.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Ranked-choice voting has already caused many problems. First, the Maine Supreme Court ruled it's unconstitutional for state general elections. Now Maine uses two different voting methods. This is confusing. RCV is costlier, less secure, and leaves voters in doubt of outcomes for a prolonged period. The Australian people I've quizzed give a very different picture of how this system plays out over the years. I am convinced that RCV does not improve outcomes and do not support expansion.\James Wilfong (D)\Did not respond.\Senate District 19\James Hamper (R) - Incumbent\Did not respond.\Michael McKinney (D)\Did not respond.\Senate District 20\Eleanor Espling (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Maine has record low unemployment and increased state revenues, thanks to sound fiscal management over the last eight years. Businesses that struggled during the recession are seeing more economic success in Maine. When I speak with big and small business owners, the biggest issue they are facing is finding people to work. Workforce development will be a key priority in the upcoming session. Maine can do more to recruit workers as we have so much to offer as a state.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\While I have concerns about the long-term budget consequences of expanding Medicaid, it can only be funded within the scope of the budget. This will require the Legislature setting priorities and making hard choices. A responsible budget would be one that does not increase taxes and does not take money out of the rainy day fund.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform simply means helping the truly needy by ensuring those dollars go to providing for basic needs. A successful welfare program is one that moves someone from poverty to prosperity. The success of a program is one that moves people from dependency to independence, not arbitrarily eliminating people from a program but really working with people to get them back on their feet. We all need help from time to time.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\We all use Maine's roads and bridges, so I would like to see it a higher priority in using general fund dollars in the highway budget. We take in revenue from multiple taxes on cars and trucks which just goes into the general fund, never to find its way into the highway fund budget. We can do better at funding our infrastructure maintenance costs.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\First we should assess what alternative energy technologies make the most sense in Maine. I have always been open to alternatives in making sure our energy portfolio is as diverse as possible. However, it should not be done at the expense of taxpayers or ratepayers.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support laws that are both good for the woman and her unborn child. I support a woman having all the information she needs to make an informed decision understanding the other options she may have available to her for support should she want to give birth to the child.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\As a legislator who was named ""Advocate of the Year"" in 2015 by the Home Care and Hospice Alliance of Maine, I have worked across party lines on home care issues. The Legislature has made home care a priority, so to say we need to invent a new system of delivering that care is unreasonable. The tax will also be detrimental in attracting the young professionals we need in our state to provide care when we already have a worker shortage.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do not favor changing the state constitution to enable ranked choice voting. Proponents knew it was unconstitutional when it was put on the ballot. If they were truly concerned about the constitutional problems around the initiative, they should have sought to amend the constitution first.\Ned Claxton (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Maine needs an expanding workforce that is ready to maintain what we have and to grow in new directions. There are not enough trained workers now to meet the current needs in the trades - plumbing, electrical, etc., and we need more well-trained and trainable workers to take on new work. To be successful, we need to encourage people to move to Maine, promote strong apprenticeships options and have good job training resources in place for those workers interested in additional training.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\There appears to be adequate funding to initiate the Medicaid expansion – a funding bill was passed but then vetoed. After the first year's costs, funding needs to be part of the biannual budget considerations. How to fund the expansion should be part of a healthy discussion of Maine's priorities and funding ability.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\All of our welfare programs need periodic assessment to make sure they are accomplishing the purposes for which they were created. Each program needs to be compassionate, focused and effective or it needs to be revised. Reform should follow evidence of under-performance. Just as individuals should be held accountable for their actions, programs should be held accountable to their goals and outcomes.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\We need a new way to fund infrastructure funding. Along with many other states, we need to explore options that factor in vehicle weight, miles traveled and vehicle value, to name a few factors. How would a 1% increase in the state sales tax compare to the shrinking revenue from the gas tax? Would that be acceptable to Mainers, given a substantial contribution from out of state visitors? Dedicating those dollars to state and local road repair could decrease the property tax burden.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\We need to continue to develop renewable energy as a step toward lower cost electricity in Maine. This is a key step in moving toward energy independence, decreasing our fossil fuel dependency, and creating a healthy and clean environment to foster economic growth. Newer technologies and infrastructure improvements have been the focus of incentives. In the past. Solar, water and wind are no different. They should be expanded to help avoid degrading Maine's special environmental qualities.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\The Supreme Court of the United Sates has ruled that access to abortion is legal and a protected constitutional right. Therefore, we should work to assure that all Maine women have equal access to this health care service. That access needs to be supplemented with ongoing education and other efforts to decrease unplanned pregnancies and to promote adoption as an alternative to abortion.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\While I completely support the goal of helping caregivers make a livable wage as they do the important work of keeping people in their homes, I am voting against Question 1. The funding mechanism - a one-time fix for a specific issue, does not address other important state needs. We need to avoid creating a relatively independent, quasi-governmental entity to manage this revenue. This benefit should go only to people who most need it and not to everyone. We need further discussion on funding.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes, based on what the voters have said, we should amend the constitution to allow for ranked choice voting in state elections. There is evidence that this process may improve the civility of our elections – something we sorely need. We should respect the voters' wishes and give it a fair try.\Senate District 21\Nathan Libby (D) - Incumbent\Did not respond.\Nelson M. J. Peters, Jr. (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Lack of qualified workers is the biggest barrier. The Legislature can do at least two things to assist. First, remove all but the most essential barriers so entrepreneurs can thrive in a Maine economic environment. Second, make trade school education inexpensive and easily available to all who will remain in Maine and work.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\All approved referendums come with a cost. The legislature cannot raise taxes to pay for every new program, it just isn't possible. Other budget items must be cut to pay for the new program. If the Legislature can't make the cuts then the Governor should have the authority to cut line items from the budget to balance the budget without raising taxes. I think this also helps the voters to set priorities.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare should be a temporary safety net for those in real need of assistance. Reform is to assure that welfare doesn't become a way of life. We certainly should give people a hand up when needed and help them to regain their independence from the need for welfare.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maintaining infrastructure should not rely on one form of revenue. The funds from the gas tax should go into the general fund and additional general funds may well be needed to assist to pay for the upkeep of the infrastructure. Bonding is a useful technique if used properly but it must be remembered interest is paid on that money borrowed. The Legislature needs to set priorities to pay for what is necessary.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Remove barriers and add incentives to move all of us toward renewable resources. It is just the right thing to do.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\The law is this area has become quite settled over the last 30 years. I would suggest we encourage the private sector to provide options and opportunities for women who might wish to have a child adopted as well as expand the opportunity for birth control and education.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Against. Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Wathen said it's deeply unconstitutional in many respects. The Chamber of Commerce says it ""over-promises and under delivers."" This legislation is ill-conceived.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No. Everyone gets just one vote.\Senate District 22\Lois Kilby-Chesley (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\There are many intertwined threads why Maine's economy has remained stagnant. As a career teacher I see the primary need to invest in education. Research provides a plethora of information on the benefits of early childhood education, adequately funding PreK to grade 12, and providing access to higher education. Without a strong educational system we will continue to fall behind our neighbors. We also need to work to maintain, and grow, our working population through sustainable development.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\There is funding available right now that could get Medicaid expansion started through May 2019. Once the new Legislature is seated it will become imperative to assign dedicated funding to continue helping Mainers in need. This should have begun on July 1, but up to now more than 3500 Mainers have been denied. Again we see evidence of ignoring the will of the voters through the Governor's veto of $60 million that was allocated by the Legislature.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\In order to reform programs it is important that access is available to the neediest families - a target we often miss. After the economic disaster in 2008 more families with children were drawn into the system. In Maine 1 in 4 children qualifies for free/reduced lunch, an indicator of the severity of the needs. We must be consolidating services to give youngsters and families the leg up to improve their opportunities for success.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I have never believed bonds were the way to fund infrastructure of roads and bridges in Maine. Over the 10-year life of the bond we pay millions in interest. Just like in our own finances we have reached the point when we should be spending 'real' money not depending on bonds. Getting there will hurt in the short-term but be beneficial in the future. I do support raising the gasoline tax to help raise the necessary revenues.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I am a proponent of solar and off-shore wind energy. Providing incentives for renewable energy is one way to encourage development of an alternative energy grid. I am opposed to CMP's transmission line from Canada, through ME to MA. Maine needs to view the long-term impacts, and providing incentives now will put us on the path to sustainable energy.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I believe that every women has the right to make decisions for her body, her well-being, her family, her sexuality, including reproductive rights. Choosing an abortion is already a difficult decision and restricting a woman's choices would force us back to a time when laws decided for us. I believe that every woman has the right to own her body.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting for universal home health care in Maine. At the present time I am personally aware of the problems of home assistance for elderly and disabled Mainers. Care for those who want to stay in their homes, in place of a nursing home, is currently unregulated and quality care is hard to find. Q.1 would make home health care a profession and raise the standard of care.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Ranked choice voting has proven it works. The required constitutional amendment is the necessary next step to expand it to state general elections.\Jeff Timberlake (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\In the last eight years, under Republican leadership, we made the largest tax cut in state history and reduced burdensome, unnecessary regulations. But much more work needs to be done in order for Maine to compete with other states, as well as reduce wasteful state spending. I will advocate for more tax relief for Maine's families and small businesses. We also need to reform our citizen's initiative process to prevent outside groups from forcing Mainers to vote on expensive tax schemes.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\My first priority is helping Mainers who are truly in need, including those with mental and development disabilities who remain on waitlists for services. I believe we should focus on them before paying for health insurance for able-bodied, childless adults who would be covered by Medicaid expansion. If we are going to go through with Medicaid expansion, we need to find a way to fund it without raising taxes, dipping into our rainy day fund, or using one-time budget gimmicks.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\In recent years, the Legislature has made significant strides in cracking down on welfare abuse, despite attempts by Democrats to block these reforms. I am not opposed to having a safety net for those who fall on hard times, but we cannot afford to make welfare a permanent way of life for able-bodied Mainers. I believe in the principle of ""a hand up, not a handout."" All of our efforts regarding this issue should be focused on guiding people out of the welfare system and into the workforce.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I am generally opposed to borrowing money for projects that we could pay for with existing resources in the state budget. However, in the past I have supported transportation and other infrastructure bonding in order to maintain our roads and bridges. I have also supported bonding for our colleges in order to help keep our young people in Maine.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\In order to be competitive, Maine needs dependable and cost-effective sources of energy. That means expanding our capacity for natural gas and hydro power throughout the state. I am not opposed to alternative power sources such as solar and wind, as long as Maine ratepayers aren't expected to pay for them. In order to be competitive, alternative energy needs to be affordable.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am and have always been pro-life. I don't agree with public funding for abortion, but this is largely a federal matter. I am more focused on improving our economy, lowering taxes, and bringing more jobs to Maine.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\All four of Maine's gubernatorial candidates have come out against Question 1, and that should tell us all we need to know. It is an ill-conceived, costly idea that would make Maine the highest-taxed state in the nation. I encourage everyone to lean more by visiting stopthescammaine.com.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Ranked-choice voting is a hot mess! Maine's Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional at the state level in general elections, so we're now only using it in primary elections and for federal offices in the general elections. This is extremely confusing to the voter. RCV violates the principle of ""one person, one vote,"" and doesn't even guarantee the ""winner"" gets the majority of the vote. Further, the cost of ranked-choice voting for the primary in June greatly exceeded initial estimates.\Senate District 23\Eloise Vitelli (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Biggest barrier is our workforce. Our population is shrinking; we are getting older. We need: to attract younger people; a workforce that is skilled & prepared for global economy. Legislature's role: fund education, pre-k to post-secondary, quality training for existing & future workforce; support public-private partnerships e.g. Maine Spark & goal of 60% of Mainers with credential of value by 2025; make health care available & affordable for all ; affordable housing & expand broadband .\[image id=""2708690"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The Legislature had identified funding within the existing budget, including surplus revenues, to get Medicaid expansion implemented and through the first year. Keeping in mind that state spending draws down significant federal funds, the process for funding Medicaid going forward is the same process used to fund any state spending obligations. The state has to balance its budget; in the future, Medicaid will be considered for funding along with all the other priorities.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Our social services programs are designed to assist those in need who, through illness, disability, loss of income , family/ life circumstances, are unable to provide for themselves the necessities of living. Welfare reform is what we should do to be sure our programs are serving individuals in need with respect and dignity, are helping them identify and take steps towards greater personal responsibility, holding individuals accountable while providing them appropriate support and guidance.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\As vehicles become more efficient, and as we move away from total reliance on gas to fuel our transportation, yes, we will need to come up with alternative ways of maintaining our existing transportation infrastructure than the current gas tax. I don't know what the answer is, but I am in support of taking a look at innovative ways we might resolve this issue – sooner rather than later.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. We need to move past our reliance on carbon based fuels. increase our use of alternative, renewable energy sources and in the process, create jobs and businesses that will employ Maine people and reverse the negative impacts on our environment.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Access to abortion should be protected for all Maine women. Currently, women in rural areas and low-income women, specifically those on Medicaid, are limited in their ability to access an abortion should they choose to do so, either because of distance or cost. I am in favor of taking steps that would ensure all women have access to these services.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\There is a clear need for home care services. Helping someone stay in their homes is less expensive than taking care of them in an institution.. I am not, however in favor of this initiative. The proposal should have had a hearing before a legislative committee. Developing a complex new program, & a new tax , would be better done in consideration of the broader context of how to best provide services , how we train and compensate workers providing the care, & how we pay for these services.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\If what is required to fully implement ranked choice voting for all elections within the state is a constitutional amendment, yes. I would support that.\Richard Donaldson (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\High taxes are not conducive to attracting new business and skilled workers to Maine. The legislature must work together to reduce taxes on small businesses and working families to encourage economic growth.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\We need to find a way to pay for expansion without raising taxes or using one-time gimmicks. Our inability to pay for Medicaid expansion in the past resulted in enormous hospital debt. We can't go down that road again.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\To me, welfare reform means providing a safety net for those who are unable to help themselves, while also providing assistance to help people climb out of poverty. I will be a watch dog to ensure that our tax dollars are used wisely and not wastefully.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maintaining our infrastructure is critical to Maine's citizens and economy. I am always willing to look at new funding proposals, however I believe that we cannot afford to solve this problem by raising taxes.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Maine's energy costs are among the highest in the nation. I support incentivizing renewable energy here in Maine through tax credits and low interest loans but I do not believe we should pass this cost on to the ratepayers.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I would not change the current Maine laws surrounding abortion.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Maine doesn't need any additional taxes to lead us to become one of the highest taxed states in the nation. I believe that we need to make home health care affordable for those who need it but this initiative is not the right approach. I will be voting no.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I wouldn't support a constitutional amendment for ranked-choice voting. The costs are too high and the last gubernatorial primary proved that the benefits are marginal.\Senate District 24\Everett Brownie Carson (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\There are two: Lack of a skilled work force to fill jobs that are open, and the high cost of health care for employers who want to provide it for employees.\We must step up funding and capacity for vocational training at the high school level, and also align skills training at community colleges to the jobs that are and will be open to workers.\We must design and implement a health insurance program that makes quality, affordable health care accessible and affordable for all Maine citizens.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\There are sufficient funds now in Maine's Medicaid account to move forward with expansion--we need to do it. Both voters (by ballot initiative) and the legislature have approved expansion. Healthy citizens will be more productive, and will particiapte more actively in the workforce and in community life. There is NO reason not to move forward.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\To ""reform"" welfare should mean that public assistance programs provide support services: such as education and skills training, substance abuse treatment, mental health counseling, transportation (as needed to get to a job or medical appt.), and quality child care (as needed), so that recipients have the bast possible opportunity to reach their potential as productive citizens. We need to get away from the approach of penalizing people who need assistance and services.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Absolutely. Annual borrowing for transportation infrastructure means we pay the extra cost of interest on each bond. We can and should raise the over-the-road fuel tax, so that our revenue stream meets our needs. When we have a large, specific project (i.e., new bridge over a major river), then borrowing/bonding is justified. We need to improve the condition of our transporytation (and broadband) infrastructure to promote economic development in all regions of Maine.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Solar is the best example today of clean, renewble power. Expanding solar capacity will bring clean, renewable energy to Maine while creating good jobs that cannot be ""exported."" Our laws, such as limiting the number of participants in a community solar project, are badly outdated. Prices for electricity will be more stable over the long term with clean, renewable solar and wind--making incentives a good deal for Maine people.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I believe that a woman should have unrestricted access to reproductive health services, including abortions, provided by competent, licensed medical practitioners. A woman's choice about whether to have an abortion should be a decision that she makes in consultation with her doctor.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will vote ""no."" While I fully support providing home health care for seniors and adults with disabilities, I do not favor constructing such a program outside the structure of a well-integrated, thoughtfully designed comprehensive health care system. Creating and funding such a system is a tall order, but Maine needs to do it, and we all should participate in designing and paying for it.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. RCV is the best way, short of a run-off between the two top vote getters, to elect the candidate with the broadest support among voters. It may also dampen negative campaign practices over time, but the jury is out on that effect.\Diana Garcia (R)\Did not respond.\Senate District 25\Catherine E. Breen (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Two items: workforce development and access to the internet. We need to make strategic investments in early childhood education through higher education to build a workforce ready for the global economy. And we need to continue to facilitate the deployment of internet access in underserved parts of Maine, where we have enormous potential for local agriculture, aquaculture and many other Maine-based entrepreneurial opportunities.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I co-authored the bill that funded Medicaid expansion and met all of the governor's subjective conditions. And he vetoed it. We have a surplus and we don't need to make cuts or raise taxes to fund this. There is no funding problem. Furthermore, expanding medicaid will bring in hundreds of millions of federal dollars into Maine's healthcare system. Return on investment is $1 state funds = $9 federal funds.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform means smart, targeted investments, based on data and evidence, that help Maine people move from poverty to economic security and dignity.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. Without any substantial federal transportation funding coming to us, bonding is the most practical way to fund these critical needs. Especially when interest rates are so low, as they are now.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Maine's geographic attributes position us well to take advantage of solar, off-shore wind and tidal power research and development. And climate change - caused by fossil fuel consumption - is already changing the Gulf of Maine in ways that threaten our fishing economy. We can and we must enact policies that give incentives to businesses and homeowners to move away from oil and toward renewables.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Every Maine woman needs and deserves safe, affordable access to a full range of health care services, including cancer screenings, birth control, and abortion.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\While I appreciate our responsibilities to our elderly and disabled family members and neighbors, this bill is not the best way to address this critical challenge. I will be voting No.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. I was the lead Senate sponsor of this bill in the 128th legislature. I will continue to support the will of the voters.\Cathleen Nichols (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Keep the referendum process out of tax issues. We cannot compete with other states to find workers because our income taxes are too high. Pass legislation to prevent outside interests from funding efforts to pass bad laws. Toying with our tax rate creates an unstable and unreliable economy that discourages growth & reduces the ability to increase wages. Both parties see this problem but still can't agree on a remedy. Assess Maine's incentives for attracting workers & getting people back to work.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\We need to find the proper funding and ensure this won't bankrupt our hospitals again ($75 million). Health care should not be mandated, and a variety of care should be available in the free market. Health care costs for lower income earners should be reduced at an exponential rate, not at a flat rate which kills a work incentive. Also the cost of health care for others should not increase to compensate for the subsidized health care of others. Taxes should not be the venue for this program.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform is including incentive programs for working when social support it provided. There are light work and part time opportunities available for those with physical limitations. Not everyone is employable of course, and I hope that the assessment process to evaluate if people qualify for social services is accurate and under constant review.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. We should eliminate duplicate administration whenever possible, such as merging the MEDOT and Maine Turnpike Authority. Also, our toll fees are not competitive with other states. Much of our maintenance and infrastructure needs are a result of Maine's visitors; we should re-assess if the use:pay ratio is appropriate.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Incentives must be effectively targeted & likely to reduce rates for all ratepayers. I support renewable energy, especially when it is home grown, & I support energy efficiency such as heat pumps, LED lighting & computerized air motor controls. Maine's energy problems are that others are benefiting more than us. Our power delivery costs from CMP are the highest in the nation; they have a questionable service record, a monopoly on Maine's energy market, & are owned by a company based in Spain.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Not until we determine if there is enough support for preventing unwanted pregnancies, in particular with substance abuse. We should investigate successful programs used elsewhere, whether it be better access to birth control or educational incentives that would reduce teen & drug-related pregnancies. I believe if girls were physically active we might see fewer teen pregnancies. If there is a correlation between daily PE classes & improved mental health, we'd see girls making better choices.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Against. This CI will bankrupt our state. There are 4 existing agencies that effectively and conscientiously support home-care. This CI has no income limit and would allow non-residents of Maine to qualify. Moreover, in violation of HIPAA, this proposed bureaucracy would disclose the personal information of all people who are eligible to receive in-home care support. People in nursing homes would not qualify. Workers would automatically become government workers and pay state union dues.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No. RCV marginalizes my vote for my chosen candidate because it allows multiple choices (which are additional votes) to another voter. I don't believe that everybody's second choice should be the first choice winner. One voter, one vote, and whomever gets the most votes wins. An election should be won by a candidate who'd beat all the other candidates head-to-head.\Senate District 26\Bill Diamond (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\The state must be more supportive to our existing businesses and provide incentives to attract new businesses.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Funding options have been established, but the Legislature will have to compromise and the governor will need to provide leadership.\[image id=""2708691"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform should be defined as appropriate assistance to those in genuine need with built-in incentives to help get people off the system.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Absolutely! DOT now depends of borrowing $100M a year just to complete their biennial budget. Mixing General Fund and Highway Fund budgets should be examined.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes, renewable is the answer to our long term energy solutions.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support the laws that we currently have are sufficient.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I'm voting NO. This is one of the most destructive proposals we've seen on the ballot in a long time. The negative impact that this will have on small businesses and middle class families is substantial.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No, RCV is costly to implement, doesn't guarantee any candidate will end up with a majority of the vote. This system will be even more cumbersome if both political parties are required to put their candidate through the process unlike what happened in the June primary.\Senate District 27\Ben Chipman (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\We need a multi-pronged approach to economic development. We must start with embracing New Mainers as a key to addressing our challenges. A recent study found that New Mainers pumped $1.2B into the Greater Portland economy in 2016. In Portland, our chief barrier is workforce development – so we must invest in skills training programs. I sponsored legislation this session to provide training for New Mainers. In rural Maine, we must create more incentives for people to start businesses.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I have been a strong supporter of Medicaid expansion, and there are already ample funds in the account to get the program started. In the longer-term, repeated studies have shown that in states where Medicaid has been expanded, there has not been an increase in state spending. Taxpayers already foot the bill for people without healthcare who utilize the emergency room. Medicaid expansion will decrease these costs and will also lead to the creation of 4,000 jobs and additional revenue.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\When I hear the term ""welfare reform,"" it is most often in the context of legislation that would increase the hurdles for people seeking to access social safety net programs. Having grown up in a low-income, single-parent household, I know what it is like to go without basic necessities – and I don't believe anyone should have to.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I do believe the state should revisit the way it funds infrastructure projects. We should not be borrowing money for basic infrastructure needs, because it unnecessarily costs the taxpayer for the interest we must pay on such borrowing. I would instead prefer to fund regular maintenance of roads and bridges as part of our ongoing expenses in the state budget. High-quality roads and bridges – not to mention rural broadband – are crucial if we want to attract the business we need to grow.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes, the state should absolutely expand incentives for renewable energy technologies. I strongly supported bipartisan legislation that would have created 600 jobs in solar energy throughout Maine, but Governor LePage vetoed it. We should resubmit that legislation with a new governor. Maine should be a leader in solar and wind energy, but right now we are lagging behind the rest of New England. This is a shame, and I will continue to push for investing in renewable energies.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am proud to be endorsed by Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America, and I will always stand with women and defend their right to make their own reproductive health choices. I believe we should be doing everything we can to protect and expand reproductive healthcare, and that the government should play no role in telling women what they can or cannot do with their bodies. As a Senator, I have worked to defeat all efforts to restrict reproductive freedom.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting for Question 1, because there is clearly a need for more home care services for our elderly and disabled populations. Maine is one of the oldest states in the country and we must provide our senior population with the services they deserve. If Question 1 passes, I will work with the legislature to ensure that the tax threshold only applies to single individuals and not to married couples or businesses. I will also work to ensure the complete privacy of home care patients.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes, I support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting for all Maine elections. As a member of the Portland Charter Commission, I brought ranked-choice voting to Maine and I have defended it at every turn. I believe that ranked-choice voting ensures greater representation for people's electoral choices and that it should absolutely be applied to gubernatorial and legislative elections.\Crystal Canney (U)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\We need to do more to support our small businesses either through innovative programs that attract an educated workforce or incentives that show a direct return on investment. I have talked to a number of small businesses in Portland and most will tell you healthcare costs keep them from being financially able to expand. Affordable access to education is also important to develop the educated workforce. We must start addressing the costs of higher education.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\While I believe the next legislature and Governor will implement the will of the people - if for some reason it doesn't happen we have to reprioritize the state budget - while living within our means - we can still seek out efficiencies and work towards funding healthcare.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\This is a politically charged question and unfortunately only asked from the viewpoint of the parties. Right now in Maine, Independents or unenrolled make up the largest percentage. That said, welfare reform to me - means getting what is needed to people who have no other options. There are definitely people who need services without question, however, we also need to have a basic standards test as we can't pay for those who might be able to be more self-sufficient. It is a balance.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Because vehicles are more fuel efficient we have seen in the gas tax. Increased user fees are one example of how to increase revenue. It will take a myriad of solutions including working with our Washington, D.C. delegation to prioritize this issue.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. I am supportive of increasing tax incentives for renewable energy. It is part of a larger picture around climate change. A recent United Nations report on climate change reveals serious changes to the earth within the next 12 years. Maine and everywhere else will face repercussions from climate change. Solar and wind are part of the solution - and wind where it makes sense to do these projects - are a piece of that larger discussion.""\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I believe it is a decision between a woman and her doctor on this issue. I support the continuation of Roe v Wade.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I support increased services for our elderly without question. I think this question and process is bad. The question allows a non-legislative board to oversee the money. If passed that board would not be accountable to you or me - financially. This is another case of a ballot measure in reaction to failure in Augusta. The legislature needs to prioritize the elderly and fund these programs through a state budget. If it passes however, I will absolutely support the will of the people.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do. Every election season - we hear the cry of ""spoiler"" when it comes to independent candidates. Let's take the argument away - by having Ranked Choice Voting - and just elect the best people to lead our state. There are now more independents in Maine than members of either party. Twice citizens have voted in favor of Ranked Choice Voting and Augusta has failed to deliver.\Senate District 28\Heather Sanborn (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\As our population rapidly ages, we need more young people to move to Maine so that economic growth can continue. The legislature can support this effort with student loan debt relief, high quality public schools, and early childcare programs that will attract young people to move to Maine (or stay in Maine) as they begin their careers and families. We should also enact policies that welcome immigrants from all over the world and help them to quickly become valuable members of our workforce.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Medicaid expansion will end up being a net positive for our state economy, pumping more than $450 million federal tax dollars back into our economy each year. Expansion states realize savings in other areas of their budget – particularly in addressing the opioid crisis – by utilizing Medicaid expansion to address critical health needs. With current revenues running far above budget projections, the funding is available right now to implement Medicaid expansion and we should do so immediately.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform ought to mean that we're being thoughtful and creative about addressing the root causes of poverty and that we're being proactive in addressing the needs of individual needs of Mainers who are struggling to make ends meet. This includes ensuring that low-income Mainers have access to high-quality health care (in part through Medicaid expansion), and that they have the food, shelter, transportation, child care, and job training that they need to lift themselves out of poverty.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes, the state needs to revisit the way it funds infrastructure. The revenue collected through gas taxes are dwindling due to fuel efficiency gains, but also in large measure because the gas tax is not indexed to inflation and has not be raised in many years. A task force should be put in place to consider indexing the gas tax to inflation, imposing a progressive road usage fee that is tied to the value of the vehicle, assessing a fee for annual mileage, and other creative approaches.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\We must move beyond fossil fuels so that we can slow the climate change that is already dramatically impacting our lives – as our ocean warms and storms impact us with increasing frequency and strength. Right now, our state's policies disincentivize the adoption of solar power. We should repeal these disincentives, such as the size limit on community solar farms and the new scheme that allows CMP to charge homeowners for ""delivering"" the solar power that they generate and use in their own homes.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Women should have access to the health care that they need and should be allowed to make their own choices about that health care, including access to safe, effective abortions. Maine laws generally recognize this principle and should continue to do so regardless of any further efforts to undermine Roe v. Wade.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will vote against Question 1. I believe that complex social programs and tax policy are best hashed out through the legislative process, where public hearings, stakeholder processes, and careful attention to detail make for better outcomes and fewer unintended consequences. I am in favor of Mainers being able to stay in their homes as they age and would work on legislation that provides more supports and incentives to help make that possible.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. Ranked-choice voting ensures that the will of the voters is respected and that candidates with very marginal support cannot up-end the outcome of a close election.\Senate District 29\Rebecca Millett (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Making higher education affordable is key to strengthening Maine's workforce. Our economic viability hinges on increasing the size of our population with high-quality college degrees, certificates or other credentials. To help students afford higher education, the Maine state grant needs to double to $3,000 to maintain its original purchasing power. We must continue to invest in the Opportunity Maine Tax Credit to attract and retain college graduates by providing some relief from student debt.\[image id=""2708692"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I voted to fund expansion this past session along with a majority of my legislative colleagues. The bill went to Governor LePage, who continued to ignore the will of Maine's electorate and vetoed the funding. His obstruction of implementation was aided by House republicans who voted to sustain his veto. Should I have the privilege of returning to the Senate, I will support a similar bill and get on with providing 70,000 more Maine citizens with health care\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform is about making sure that we are strategically targeting our resources toward building economic stability and opportunities for success for low income Mainers. Mainers are proud, hard working, and want a chance to contribute to our communities and have healthy families. Our job is to make sure there are no disincentives or roadblocks to ensuring Mainers opportunities to build better lives.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Current borrowing is unsustainable. The federal gas tax was last adjusted in 1993, has not kept up with inflation, and is dwindling as a source of funding. With more gas efficient, alternative energy sourced vehicles on our roads, continuing to rely on a gas tax will further degrade our roads and bridges. We need to have honest conversations about these challenges, the importance of maintaining our transportation infrastructure, and the options available including vehicle weight and usage fees.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\For generations we have consumed fuels that leave a legacy of environmental degradation for our children, including contaminated groundwater from strip mines, ocean acidification, and polluted air. As a species, we have damaged our planet more than any other living creature, but we are in possession of better technologies to reduce our impact on the environment and should be using every opportunity to bring those forward for our children's and grandchildren's future.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I oppose any attempt to weaken women's reproductive freedom. The decision to become a pregnant is a profound and personal decision that should be made without political interferenc\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I am not weighing in on Question 1. Voters can obtain objective information on this and other ballot measures through the Maine League of Women Voters at this link: http://www.lwvme.org/guide.html. As always, I will respect the will of Maine's voters.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I voted in support of LD 1624, proposing an amendment to the Constitution of Maine to determine the winner of elections for the offices of State Senator, State Representative and Governor by ranked-choice voting and to send the amendment to Maine's voters. Undermining the will of Maine voters is undemocratic. A majority of Mainers voted for ranked-choice voting and should have an opportunity to weigh in on a constitutional amendment.\George Van Syckel (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Excessive taxes and regulations\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Set up a Go fund me page for Democrats want to contribute more. In a free society you do not use government to force financial extraction on a group of people to fund your own pet projects.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Empowering opportunities for self help building self respect and self worth.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Set up a go fund me page for Democrats to contribute more.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\No! Let private enterprise develop it. Wind power will never cover even it's initial investment and scars the countryside, just look at Aroostook County. That money should have been used as matching funds for single or small group use.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Education should be done through out childhood development, that life only comes from life. It is not the man's or the women's body, it is the baby's body in and out of the womb. Under 18 requires parental permission. Individual Counciling by Rev, MD, JD, and Ph.D. before Abortion. Nothing after 1st Trimester. Restricted. I am Pro Life.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I am against para-government taxation. I am against Question 1.\I hope to initiate an emphasis in Senior care by promoting investors and pre purchasing retirement living. This will free up desperately needed housing for the younger generations. Elder care could be our greatest need.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I am opposed to a constitutional amendment that would allow Rank Choice Voting . I strongly believe in one citizen with a picture identification , one vote. This last election was proof ranked choice voting is a scam.\Senate District 30\Amy Volk (R) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Workforce. With a growing economy, now is the time to make ME a welcoming place for young workers by controlling what we can at the state level: incentivizing affordable workforce housing, lowering income taxes, continuing to provide direct property tax relief with the fairness credit and improving adult ed, community colleges and universities. We also need to find ways to encourage employers to hire workers with disabilities, the recovery community and people with criminal records.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I supported Medicaid Expansion after the voters of my district approved it, but funding is a challenge. I hope there are savings in our current budget to be identified by the next administration. We need to consider managed care, as well as implementing co-pays for emergency room visits and prescription drugs. Work requirements are under consideration in several states, including New Hampshire. We should look at equalizing taxes on non-tobacco smoking products as a possible source of revenue.\[image id=""2708693"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\""Welfare reform"" means that taxpayer dollars are spent effectively to guide people to independence. Effective reform must take a ""whole family"" approach, addressing child care, transportation, education and job training, particularly in our rural areas, increasing the capacity for parents to provide and care for their families independently. When Maine began enforcing TANF time limits, we saw recipient incomes rise 237% in 4 years. Work/training requirements for SNAP yielded similar results.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I would not mind seeing Maine capture more use taxes (non-commercial tolls) for roads and bridges, particularly May-October. In general, I believe our seasonal residents and visitors should be shouldering more of the tax burden in Maine. I have worked on tax reform that would broaden our sales tax and I continue to support doing so in order to create a more predictable and fair system of balancing our state budget.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\The federal government already provides high subsidies to wind and solar, per MWH produced. ME should instead support hydro and biomass, which provide key base load power to the grid. Biomass and hydro are easily adjusted to meet demand. The additional benefit of biomass generation is the market created for waste wood and the sawdust byproducts of our forest-related industries. By contrast, wind and solar are unreliable electricity sources, fine for residential, but not helpful to industry.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Choosing to end a pregnancy is a major decision and one that may stay with a woman for a lifetime. I believe that women should, at minimum, have every opportunity to make a completely informed decision. This includes being offered an ultrasound and/or information on fetal development.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I do not support Question 1 because it puts many hard-working, middle class, double income families into one of the highest income tax brackets in the country to pay for the care of any disabled or elderly person in Maine, regardless of income or even residency status. Additionally, the quasi-government entity it would create to oversee this care would not be accountable to elected officials and would likely violate HPPA law.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do not support increasing the scope of ranked-choice voting. Ranked-choice has already cost Maine taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars while we were struggling to find funding to increase the pay for and number of DHHS case workers. I would prefer to see that money used for any number of better causes, including student debt relief, drug treatment, preventive healthcare, state salary increases, etc. The needs are great. We cannot afford to be spending extra money counting ballots.\Linda Sanborn (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\The biggest challenge facing our community is the lack of opportunity for young people to find quality jobs and raise a family. The challenge of affording higher education and then finding work that pays a fair wage forces young people to move out of Maine. Career and technical education programs lead to good jobs with steady wages and benefits, and the legislature needs to fund CTE programs to make sure that the training students receive keeps up with changing needs in a changing economy.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Implementing an expansion of MaineCare is essential to the health and well-being of Mainers, and Maine's economy. As the legislature demonstrated multiple times during the most recent legislative session, there is sufficient funding available to expand MaineCare, especially given that this expansion will leverage significant federal matching money into the state to help provide care for the 70,000 Mainers left without access to a doctor by Governor LePage and his legislative allies.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\True welfare reform moves people out of poverty and allows them to become more self-sufficient. We must create opportunities for education and training, so that people can get a good job, take care of their families, and be productive members of the community. Supporting programs like Parents as Scholars, that help struggling families get the education they need by assisting them with child care or transportation, have proven to move families out of poverty.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Our current cycle of borrowing to pay for roads and bridges does not do nearly enough to articulate a long-term vision for building Maine's infrastructure. We need sustainable revenue plans to pay for that infrastructure, and we need to increase our understanding of the infrastructure Maine needs, moving beyond roads and bridges and into high-speed internet access for all of Maine, transportation options that don't rely on single-passenger vehicles, and updating our aging wastewater facilities.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Of course we should. Not only is reducing our CO2 emissions a moral imperative to attempt to stem the tide of climate change, but investing in clean energy is great for Maine's economy. The only reason to oppose renewable energy technology is to cozy up to the oil and gas lobby, and they know they're wasting their time with me.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Particularly given the threat posed to abortion access by the current composition of the Supreme Court, Maine should codify the right to access an abortion and ensure that access to legal health care procedures is available to all, regardless of economic status. Also, advanced practice nurses and certified nurse midwives should be allowed to practice to the fullest extent of their license, including care for women who desire a first-trimester medically induced abortion.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I know that seniors want to age at home whenever possible and assisting them with home care is both economically prudent for the state and greatly improves one's quality of life. I also believe that it is the legislature's job to develop a system where all are cared for responsibly. Ultimately, I fear that the legislature lacks the political will to develop, fund and implement such as system, and I was moved by the Maine Council of Churches supporting Question 1. I plan to vote in favor of it.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\On this issue, Mainers voted to approve such a system, and the legislature has a responsibility to legally and fully implement it. For all the logistical hurdles such a system might seem to pose to the legislature, ensuring that Mainers are able to cast their votes in a manner that represents their best intentions and desires at the ballot is a goal worth pursuing.\Senate District 31\Justin Chenette (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\The need for more workers is hindering economic growth. To attract young families and workers to our state, we must ensure folks can afford to buy and stay in their homes. We must make Maine a more affordable place to live. Property taxes and a lack of affordable housing options keep many families away. I led the effort to increase the homestead exemption & expand the property tax fairness credit. We must assist with start up small business costs. As President of Saco Main Street I see the need.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The only reason Medicaid expansion is not in place is because of Governor LePage. He has held this up every chance he gets. The legislature has outlined several funding sources to cover any costs above and beyond using money in the existing program. We also have a major budget surplus that can be used to expand healthcare to more people and drive down costs in the system. I have supported Medicaid expansion every step of the way and will push for it's full implementation.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\It means accountability in the system. The real money is in corporate welfare. Taxpayers have been picking up the tab for lining corporate shareholder and CEO pockets. As a Taxation Committee member, I've seen this. Hundreds of millions of dollars each year automatically doled out without any oversight in how the money is spent or if it's yielding benefits for Mainers. We must protect taxpayers by putting in claw back provisions if no jobs are created, taxpayers get their money back.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\The more and more electric vehicles on the road, the less and less the gas tax is a relevant source of revenue for much-needed infrastructure needs like road and bridge repair. As someone who drives a hybrid, charging us a special fee doesn't make sense as electric vehicles become mainstream. The Transportation Department along with the legislature will have to start researching and analyzing the best way to move to entirely new system. The elimination of the gas tax is inevitable.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Maine should be on the forefront of the energy future for this country. I've previously introduced measures to replenish the solar energy program. This offered small businesses and individual homeowners an incentive to convert their places from oil to solar. Whether a tax credit or a rebate, assisting the transition to solar can be a deciding factor in making the switch. Lowering energy costs should be a top priority.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support a women's right to make her own healthcare decisions. Interesting that the same politicians that are for 'smaller government' are the same ones that want government to come into a women's life and dictate the terms of what she can and cannot do. I believe current law is adequate by offering protections and access. If proposals to change this would be introduced, I would oppose them.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting for the ballot question. It's proven that home-based care reduces costs in providing care to vulnerable populations. People want to age in place and ability to pay shouldn't be a barrier. This helps address the need for care. The funding mechanism will need to reviewed if passed. We already had a referendum targeting the cost of education by requiring the wealthiest among us to pay their fair share that hasn't been implemented yet. I don't want to pit students against seniors.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Respecting the will of the voters shouldn't be an option. When a small group of politicians can cherry-pick which election results to abide by, it's a a slippery slope for our democratic intuitions. Politicians can disagree about a referendum, but they shouldn't disagree about the outcome of the election. Proposing a constitutional amendment only sends it back out to the people to vote. The public has a right to weigh in on whether they would like to make Ranked Choice Voting constitutional.\Stavros Mendros (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Regulations, red tape and taxes. Love him or hate him, anyone who does not recognize Governor LePage's amazing success at increasing the standard of living is lying to themselves.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\If we are even going to seriously tackle the Opioid crisis we need to provide services to addicts and the mentally ill. Those services will not be given until those people have coverage. They won't get jobs until they get the help they need. If we don't give them the care they need, we will be spending a LOT more when they wind up in jail or the hospital.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\There are too many mid level managers in state government. They justify their existence by making front line workers do more reports thus giving them less time to provide services and costing taxpayers far too much money. And ultimately, less actual help is given to the people the services are there to help. Social Services need to be help for the needy not a jobs program for bureaucrats.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Construction rates increase annually at a greater rate than the interest on our bonds. So putting off projects until we have money will actually cost more to do and because of the damage not being repaired in time the improvements will be greater. This is truly an example of being penny-wise and pound-foolish.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\This always turns out to be a way to funnel money into the hands of politically connected groups and hasn't had anything to do with conserving resources in many years.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I oppose government sanctioned killing in any form. Be it a death penalty for murderers or babies. Federal law really ties the state's hands on this.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I was the lead House sponsor of a similar bill while serving in the 119th. The parts of the bill that provide funding and take away privacy rights need to be amended but I like the concept and am leaning in favor of this.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\The people have voted for this twice. As an elected official how can I not respect the will of the voters who put me into office?\Senate District 32\Susan Deschambault (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\We need to give young people a reason to stay in Maine as well as move here--and demonstrate that you can find a high wage job or successfully grow a business here. There are a couple of low hanging fruit: expand broadband, create career pathways and expand retraining efforts for our returning military veterans, expand mentor/internship programs between secondary and post-secondary students with local businesses, and, finally, expand the Opportunity Maine program.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The Legislature has offered numerous ways to fund Medicaid expansion. At this point, it's become a political football for a small group of expansion opponents. We could use Tobacco Settlement funds or use funds from the revenue surplus. Meanwhile, for every day that we don't expand Medicaid, tens of thousands of people are going without health insurance and we're losing money matched by the feds.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\It's as simple as preserving assistance when our neighbors or our families fall on hard times and ensuring that the safety net is transparent and accountable. . A recipient shouldn't abruptly lose assistance because they've received a bump in income. Next, is ensuring that people aren't gaming the system. Doing so takes money away from those who genuinely need it. Welfare is one way to lift people out of poverty - we have to ensure that the system can work.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Borrowing every year to pay for regular maintenance isn't sustainable. Recent projections show shortfalls in the coming years. Increased fuel efficiency and a stagnant state gas tax since 2011, Maine's gas tax no longer sufficiently covers the needs of our highways. Look at other options such as direct the sales tax from transportation related purchases and devote it to the highway maintenance fund. Make sure we're spreading the cost among the users of the state's highways.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Climate change is a major threat to our natural resources and to our economy. We need to move away from energy sources that increase carbon emissions; instead move toward increasing our use of clean, renewable energy. Incenting renewable energy technologies, we can aggressively move toward clean energy policies like those of our other N.E. neighbors. Wind and solar development can expand our workforce, provide more business for other Maine companies, and make Maine an energy leader.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support the current laws that support a woman's right to control their health and fertility--and ultimately their bodies. I would not support any bills that would seek to limit or restrict that.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Q1 offers a solution that would not be good for Maine. My primary objection is that there's no means or residency test. If passed, it would take Maine taxpayer money and give it to those who don't need it. Next, if passed, Maine would have the highest income tax rate in the country-taxing families making more than $128,400/year. Lastly, it sets up a board that's not accountable to taxpayers or elected representatives. We need to solve for this problem creatively, fairly, and sustainably.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\It makes sense at this point, after the voters have had an opportunity to test it out during the primary and now the general election, that we put the issue of amending the constitution for state races out to referendum and let the people decide. I've heard strong opinions on both sides of the issue--including voters who initially supported RCV and have since changed their minds.\Scott Normandeau (R)\Did not respond.\Senate District 33\David Woodsome (R) - Incumbent\Did not respond.\John Tuttle (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\We need to become more innovative with economic development in Maine. I believe that we can go to every town in Senate District 33 and find something that is unique to that community for the purpose of economic development and job growth for that town. We need to increase our efforts to assist the family farm so that young people can come back and continue farming as their families have done for generations. Maine was the bread basket of the country, I feel that we can become that again.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Without the Medicaid expansion Maine hospitals will suffer greatly especially in rural areas. The expansion will also help keep stability for workers in the Health Care industry. Maine is facing a shortage now of nurses and we need to fill those jobs. Federal dollars will cover the vast majority of funding for the expansion. We have seen the economic growth from other states where the program was expanded which will cover the difference. I believe the same growth can happen in Maine.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\We are all not descended from kings. Coming from a working-class family, I believe that anyone capable of work should work. There are some programs that I think are working well, but there are others that will need to be evaluated in the upcoming years such as the how state funds are used for payment of items other than essentials (food). Contrary to what some might believe, people do not like to be poor. We should help those who cannot help themselves such as the elderly and disabled.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I believe that we should still fund transportation with state and federal gas taxes. However, if a funding gap does exist we should look to other areas of state government for funding. Whether it should be dedicating a certain percent of general fund revenues or dedicating new revenues from internet sales which have not been available to Maine in the past.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I do believe that renewable energy provides great opportunity for Maine. I believe we need to invest in renewable energy such as the solar power project at the Sanford Seacoast Regional Airport expected to create 200 new jobs and millions in tax revenue.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am pro-life and a life-long Catholic so I find this difficult to address. The laws as they stand should stay in place as I do not feel that we can take away a woman's right on their decision making. I do feel that we have opportunities to provide better access to alternatives to abortion including job protections as a means to support them in pro life decisions.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I do support Question 1. I feel that providing home based care for the elderly will save the state money in the long run. It has been proven that home based care costs are far less than putting the elderly in long term care facilities.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Initially I was undecided as prior Chair of Veterans Affairs, but I do feel that we must accept the will of the people and allow for ranked-choice voting to be used in all Maine elections.\Senate District 34\Robert A. Foley (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Finding and maintaining a well trained workforce has made it difficult for existing businesses to grow and expand. The legislature needs to partner with our education system, both local and higher education, to prepare students for the jobs that are here now and into the future. Technical training centers in association with business entities and educational institutions needs to be encouraged.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\We need to place guardrails on the eligibility in order to prevent unanticipated cost overruns and incentivize more recipients in the 100% to 138% of poverty to seek coverage in the Exchange. The Exchange provides better coverage and is portable for those recipients. I would use the current hospital tax already in place to pay for the cost of expansion.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\We need to constantly evaluate each program and whether they are meeting and servicing the needs of those intended. As the economy continues to grow we need to insure that those who can work are and those needing job training in order to work receive those needed skills.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maintaining our roads and bridges needs to be a priority. Annual borrowing through bonding isn't the best way to accomplish this goal. I would support looking into using the automobile sales tax revenue as a source along with the gas tax.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I support the net metering program for solar as it provides electricity back into the grid at a competitive rate. I do not support wind energy as I believe the costs to produce and the damage to the environmental makes it too costly.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I would prefer to see fewer abortions and more adoptions being offered.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\No, I believe that the proposal is unconstitutional providing a tax and spending plan outside of the statutory budgetary process with no oversight by the legislature. I believe the proposal violates the federal HIPPA laws, There is no means testing or residency requirement to receive these services. It will take away needed resources and services from those who truly need those services while providing resources to those who do not.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No, I believe there is a simpler, less expensive way that insures a true majority winner and that is the instant runoff system where the top two candidates, if neither gets a majority, run against each other in a separate election.\Thomas J. Wright (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\To point to any one issue and say it is the biggest impediment to economic development would be difficult. During my 2 terms in the State House, I served on the Business and Economic Development Committee where we heard many great ideas. What Maine needs to focus on are the resources we have. Research and development of new wood products, creating jobs with off shore wind and solar and re-energizing our agricultural base are all things we can do now.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Medicaid expansion is a good bargain and will save Maine money. Having more people with healthcare being able to get regular checkups reduces the cost of emergency care. Doctors, hospitals, and people with healthcare cover the cost of people that don't have it. Bringing in millions of dollars of federal money will help stabilize the small hospitals serving rural areas. A healthy population is more productive and healthy children learn more.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\There will always be a part of society that will need assistance at some point in their lives. The loss of a job, an injury, illness or other unforeseen circumstance will cause someone to need assistance. Unfortunately, many people asking for help are working poor. Many have part-time jobs, sometimes two or three, with no benefits. Paying living wages is one way to help these people, reducing the need for state benefits. Any part of benefit reform needs to include job training to help people.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maine's economy depends on a robust, modern infrastructure. Roads, bridges, rail, and ports need to be upgraded to be able to quickly move goods and services in and out of the state. Gas taxes alone are not enough to pay for infrastructure and we need to broaden our tax base. Borrowing can be costly, but necessary. Just fixing the worst bridges and roads would create jobs, and would put that money back into the local economy.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\The potential available in off shore wind and solar to change Maine's energy future is enormous. There are proven technologies that the state could use to free us from the importation of fossil fuels. Every dollar spent on expanding our renewable resources keeps more money in Maine and our people working. The new technologies required create good paying jobs keeping our young people in state.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\A woman's healthcare decisions and reproductive rights should be respected and the law of the land. To reduce the number of abortions, women and men should have full access to reproductive education so there are no unplanned pregnancies. Teaching people about their reproductive rights and responsibilities will help them make better choices in their lives and eliminate the need for hard decisions later.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Maine's aging population is putting a strain on our existing safety net for seniors and those with disabilities. At the same time, there are facilities closing all over the state. The bankruptcy rate for those over 65 is soaring, often driven by medical needs. Most people want to stay in their homes to be near their family and friends and could do so with a little help. We need to find a safe, equitable way to help them while respecting their privacy.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\The voters of Maine have spoken and ranked choice voting is the law. The first round during the June primary showed it is feasible and it worked well. I would like to see it implemented for all elections and adopted nationally. With ranked choice, we get a winner that is truly the choice of the majority.\Senate District 35\Mark Lawrence (D)\Did not respond.\Michael Estes (R)\Did not respond.\Credit: Michael Shepherd BDN Staff"
221," The ATV bill drafted by the governor's ATV Task Force is expected to draw little opposition at today's public hearing in Augusta, according to task force chairman Paul Jacques.\ The bill drafted by the task force, which was appointed by the Legislature last winter, would forbid ATV riders on private property without permission.\ The bill also includes 28 recommendations that if passed would involve little cost to taxpayers and would help stop the loss of access that has resulted from rogue riders, said Jacques, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife's deputy commissioner.\ The hearing will be at 1 p.m. in the Cross Building before the Legislature's Joint Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.\ Despite the difficult economic climate in state government at the moment, Jacques said funding the recommended programs is possible because a new gas tax law will provide Inland Fisheries and Wildlife with a percentage of the gas tax to pay for ATV programs.\ That percentage will be based on the number of registered riders in Maine. As the number of riders goes up, Jacques said there will be more money available for ATV programs.\ With as many as 60,000 ATV riders expected to register this spring, Jacques said funds should be available for new programs.\ He said this year there will be money from the gas tax fund to start an ATV law enforcement grant program, the bill's top recommendation. Other recommendations would be funded as money becomes available, he said.\ Some of those recommendations require ATV safety training for those 18 and under; ATV education and trail programs to be funded with revenue from new ATV fines; and a mud season closure.\ After four public hearings in which testimony was taken from dozens of riders and landowners, Jacques said the task force expects little opposition to the bill's recommendations.\ ""The only thing some people might think is that we haven't gone far enough,"" he said. ""Most landowners who made recommendations in the bill are very supportive, certainly the majority.""\ Dan Mitchell, president of ATV Maine and a task force member, said many of the recommendations came from the ATV community, such as encouraging membership in ATV clubs by offering a discounted registration free.\ ""I don't think there is very much in those recommendations that anybody would reject,"" said Mitchell, who added the task force was represented by woodlot owners, farmers and the Nature Conservancy.\ Rep. Roger Landry, D-Sanford, the bill's sponsor, said after the extensive work the task force conducted, lawmakers will be more inclined to support the bill.\ Landry said his ATV bill last year had statewide support from legislators. And, he said, the fact the issue is a statewide problem will help to bring support today.\ ""Right now, there is no statute that prohibits anyone from taking an ATV vehicle and driving through any waterways or in them. We're concerned about damage to the environment,"" Landry said. ""There are an awful lot of natural brooks, streams, ponds and lakes that are being trudged through by ATV operators.""\ Landry's ATV bill last year led to the formation of the task force.\ Staff Writer Deirdre Fleming can be contacted at 791-6452 or at:\ dfleming@pressherald.com"
222,"Rep. Andrew McLean's bill L.D. 1149, as described in the April 12 article ""Bill calls for hybrid fees, gas tax hike to fix roads"" (Page A1), is misguided. While I understand that hybrid and electric vehicle owners currently pay less gas tax than owners of traditional gas-engine vehicles, mandating that they pay a $200 annual surcharge is ludicrous. \Consider that, according to the Federal Highway Administration, the average Maine driver travels about 12,000 miles per year. If this driver's car gets 23.6 miles per gallon of gas (average vehicle fuel efficiency), he or she burns just over 500 gallons of gas annually. \At the current gas tax rate of 30 cents per gallon, this driver pays about $152 a year in gas taxes. With the 7-cent increase in the gas tax proposed by L.D. 1149, he or she would pay about $188 a year. \Why, then, should hybrid owners (who currently pay about $80 in gas taxes annually, based on a vehicle fuel efficiency of 45 mpg) be charged an additional $200, thus paying significantly more than what an average driver pays? Similarly, why should an electric vehicle owner pay more than the average driver? The math doesn't make any sense. \I do not drive a hybrid or an electric vehicle, and I do support having all drivers pay for the roads we share, but penalizing hybrid or electric vehicle owners specifically is foolish. If anything, we should incentivize citizens to drive these cleaner, more environmentally responsible vehicles. \Eli Wilson Cumberland \Yes, Maine roads are in horrible condition, but why should I, the owner of a hybrid weighing in at less than 2,500 pounds, be surcharged $200, while the owner of a vehicle weighing in at 5,500 pounds pays no surcharge? \Weight damages roads. If the gasoline tax cannot produce enough revenue to properly repair roads, place the surcharge on weight. An added bonus to the weight surcharge is that Maine would at least appear concerned about the environment. \Thanks for listening. \Janine Myers Portland \Some hybrid owners would be happy to pay some more \The Portland Press Herald recently reported that the Maine Legislature's Transportation Committee is considering an annual surcharge on hybrid and all-electric cars to help raise the funding needed to properly care for our roads. \As the owner of a hybrid, I say, ""Do it!"" \I bought the hybrid because it was less costly to run and helped the environment - but that, in no way, resulted in my driving less. As a result, I am using the roads as much, if not more, than I did prior to the hybrid and am not contributing as much to maintenance of the roads as I did before. \Asking hybrid and all-electric vehicle owners to pay a surcharge each year is simply asking us to pay a fair share toward the maintenance of the roads. \Gail Eaton Topsham \The best thing Sen. Collins could do for Maine is resign \So Susan Collins wants the option where she could help the largest number of Mainers? \She could resign from public office and help them all. \Christopher Brent Kennebunk \Schools have dress codes for valid social reasons \Regarding ""Wearing defiance (but not on her sleeves),"" on sixth-grade Portland schoolgirl Molly Neuner's protest over a dress code (Page A1, April 13): \Schools are not only for education - they are also stages where young people may learn the power of dressing appropriately for the circumstances. \It was more than a ""distraction"" when a man came to my older son's First Communion dressed in plaid shorts, a polo shirt and knee-high white socks. It was an affront to a sacred occasion, communicating to the children that this once-in-a-lifetime event was on par with playtime. \I also recall a woman attending a church wedding in a very tight cropped top, designed to show off her well-toned midriff and implying that her mind was less on the couple getting married than on herself. \And then there was the young teller whose tight, low-cut top suggested she was more interested in the attentions of the male clients than she was in doing her job. \Scanty clothing may not be a distraction in a casual environment, but it is when a higher purpose is at hand. That is why teachers, administrators and other school staff do not come to their jobs in tank tops and shorts. \Young people need to understand that it is not their bodies per se that are the distraction, but the message they send through their clothing choices. If I were a teacher and young Molly showed up in my class in a tank top, I would question if her mind was more on being at the beach than on her studies. And, yes - that is a message I would not want her fellow students to be receiving. \Zoe Gaston Cape Elizabeth \Like it or not, LePage won election, deserves to speak \The University of Southern Maine student who said Tuesday that letting Gov. LePage or Rep. Larry Lockman speak is (as paraphrased by the reporter) ""concerning because it makes people think that their views are the norm"" obviously didn't notice that LePage won the election. Hello?! He received more votes than any other candidate; therefore, his views are the norm. (And, no, I didn't vote for him.) \The paraphrased student (Iris SanGiovanni) obviously has no confidence in the judgment of her peers among the student body. Otherwise, she wouldn't feel the need to control the information they receive from other than her own hand-picked sources. \It must be exhilarating to consider oneself the very pinnacle of correct information. Perhaps instead of having another silly election, she would deign to inspire us all by simply declaring herself Fearless Leader. \John Nichols Portland \Maine has reasonable crop of candidates for next race \Thankfully, we Mainers have such respected and talented people willing to step forward and provide sensible, balanced leadership. \Recently, we have been hearing that Susan Collins and Shawn Moody are considering a run for the Maine governorship next time around. I would like to see Janet Mills and Peter Cianchette give some thought to this, too. \Thank you to you all for being fair-minded, reasonable Mainers who contribute much to the civil discourse in our great state. \Gary Moore Cumberland"
223,"Two who oppose hike on gas tax\Once again Mainers brace to take it on the chin as the governor decides whether or not he is going to raise the gasoline tax (""King gives 'serious consideration' to a 5-cent gas tax hike,"" Dec. 12).\Why? Because of a shortfall in the highway fund created by short- sighted legislators who ""raided"" the fund to cover other expenditures.\Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I am getting pretty tired of big business as well as the state and federal government ""raiding"" my wallet every time one of them makes a mistake.\Instead of patting themselves on the back when there is a surplus and then giving tax breaks to large business and property owners, why not put that money away to cover just such emergencies?\Why do we, the general public, continually sit back and let taxes and prices rise while our take-home pay continues to dwindle? If I don't have enough money to cover my bills, I can't walk into my boss and tell him to increase my paycheck 5 percent! It's time we took control of our own destiny. It's time to say that enough is enough. We are already the fourth highest-taxed state in the nation. What are we trying to become, No. 1?\John E. Whitmore\Biddeford\IT IS SO educational to read that Jim Brunelle (""Dull but vital,"" Dec. 11) has decided to lump all legislators into the same group -- sleepy-eyed dullards who are not interested in the budget process in general, or the potential shortfall in highway revenue in particular.\Perhaps it is Mr. Brunelle's presence that puts lawmakers to sleep, not the subject.\As a rookie just starting the legislative process, it seems to me that this dedication of revenue, written into the Maine Constitution more than 50 years ago, has stood the test of time. Who better to pay for highways than the people who use them and what better way to fund highways than by taxing the product that allows the use?\Mr. Brunelle outlined two alternatives to correct the highway fund shortfall: Raise gas taxes or raid the general fund. Neither of them is very appealing. Surely, since he has covered the Legislature for so long, he must be aware that on several occasions in the past the highway fund has been raided to pay for general fund revenue gaps.\This rookie legislator can think of three more ways to supply the missing funds: Pay back the money ""borrowed"" in past years, have the Department of Transportation live with reduced funding or ask for more of our money back from Uncle Sam.\The ""generous flow of matching funds from the federal government,"" as Mr. Brunelle puts it, is nothing more than a partial refund of the money we've sent them, returning late, with no interest and usually with strings attached.\I wish to assure my constituents that they are free to call me any time on this issue and I take the pledge right now not to fall asleep! But in case they're wondering, I will oppose a gas tax increase unless there is a corresponding decrease in some other levy so as not to increase the overall tax burden.\State Rep. T.P. McKenney\Cumberland Center\Good health requires\toxic use reduction\I am a Portland physician who has a practice in environmental and nutritional medicine.\Hardly a day goes by when I don't see a patient, one of our local citizens, suffering ill health effects from toxic chemicals. Although major toxic chemical spills grab the headlines, the real daily threat to our health is the practically unregulated, under-tested use of the approximately 50,000 commercially used chemicals which flood our environment and the hundreds we all come in contact with each day.\Many of these chemicals cause cancer, birth defects, immune problems, chemical sensitivity and a host of chronic illnesses. Many chemicals thought to be ""safe"" and used for decades have been linked to major illnesses. Two examples of this are asbestos and vinyl chloride.\Maine industry puts out more than twice as many toxins per capita as any other New England state. Our state passed a Toxics Use Reduction Law in 1990. Its renewal failed in the State House last winter after intense industry lobbying against it.\The Toxics Use Reduction Law has actually saved money for many Maine industries while improving our environment and our health. I urge you to contact your local representatives and urge them to vote for renewal of the TUR law. Our health is the greatest wealth.\Joseph Py, D.O.\Portland\Vehicle excise base\should be uniform\In November, I bought a small '94 pickup from a Westbrook resident. Being a private sale, I had the opportunity to examine the vehicle's registration. I was shocked when I registered in Windham and the ""base"" was more than $2,700 higher than it had been in Westbrook!\Since the Windham town office could not provide a suitable explanation, I asked out new state representative, David Tobin, to look into the matter. His findings were equally as shocking. I quote from a letter he received from the state:\""According to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, the state does not set specific automobile base prices for municipalities to use when determining excise taxes. Individual town assessors are responsible for determining the base price of vehicles.""\The Secretary of State's Office said base price discrepancies happen for a variety of reasons, some of which include:\1. Towns use different reference books to determine the base value of the vehicle.\2. Some towns take options (air conditioning, etc.) into consideration when determining the base price. The more options the vehicle has, the higher the base price.\3. Human error.\Pardon me! My form says ""State of Maine Motor Vehicle Registration;"" it does not say Town of Windham. I feel the base price should be the same in Windham or Winslow, in Westbrook or in Wallagrass, or in Portland or Presque Isle for that matter.\Feudalism ended centuries ago. I think it is time to sweep it from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles as well.\Herbert W. Dobbins\Windham"
224,"Will Al Gore or George W. Bush pick someone from Maine to be his running mate this year?\It seems unlikely, given Maine's small population and relatively insignificant role in determining the outcome of November's election.\But in recent days, four Maine politicians have been mentioned as potential running mates by some of Washington's top political pundits.\""For Gore all roads lead to Maine,"" said President Clinton's former adviser, George Stephanopoulos, on ABC's ""This Week.""\""He's got three strong choices: George Mitchell, a former Senate majority leader; Bill Cohen, a secretary of defense, a moderate Republican and maybe a wild card. Who's the other independent governor besides Jesse Ventura? Angus King, governor of Maine.""\But co-host Cokie Roberts wasn't convinced. ""What does Maine get you?"" she asked. ""Maine?""\""It's not what; it's the person, not the state,"" Stephanopoulos responded. ""He's going to win Maine anyway. But I think those are his three strongest choices.""\Reuters news service also said Mitchell would ""add a statesmanlike figure"" to the Gore ticket, because of Mitchell's ""activities brokering peace deals in Northern Ireland.""\Newsweek also offered up Mitchell, but for another reason. ""Minimize the Bore factor"" that Gore has by picking ""an even stiffer"" politician, the magazine reported.\Newsweek also identified Sen. Olympia Snowe as a wild card candidate whom Bush might consider. David Gergen of U.S. News & World Report said that Snowe ""should also be considered"" as a pro-choice running mate, who would help fulfill Bush's promise of being ""a uniter, not a divider.""\Mickey Edwards, who teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, gave Snowe a plug in a Boston Herald piece.\Snowe ""is one of Washington's true class acts,"" Edwards writes. ""There may be some political benefit derived by virtue of her personal characteristics. But far more important is the level of experience and maturity Snowe could bring to the vice presidency and, should the need arise, the presidency itself. She is thoughtful, well- versed in both foreign policy and defense issues and a skilled coalition-builder.""\Still, Snowe, Mitchell, Cohen and King are long shots in the vice- presidential contest. Gore's top contenders include Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt.\Bush's top picks will likely include Govs. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and George Pataki of New York; and former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole.\Lehane as attack dog\Chris Lehane is quickly becoming the attack dog in this year's presidential campaign.\Lehane, who grew up in Kennebunk, is working these days as Vice President Gore's press secretary. Last week, the seemingly mild- mannered Lehane was quick with a punch once it became clear that George W. Bush would be the GOP nominee for president.\Lehane said the simple fact is that Bush is out of the mainstream.\""He is far to the right,"" Lehane said. ""He is anti-choice, anti- gun control, anti-patients' bill of rights, anti-environment and he's dead wrong when it comes to his economic policies."" So, Chris, how do you really feel?\Who's in the running\""Last call"" is over . . .\The filing deadline has passed for candidates wanting to run for Congress this year. So here's a look at who's running -- and who's not.\In November, Sen. Olympia Snowe will be challenged by Mark Lawrence, a Democrat from South Berwick and president of the Maine Senate.\Snowe and Lawrence don't face any opposition for their party's nominations. Lawrence was expecting to be challenged by perennial candidate Plato Truman. But Truman didn't file his nomination papers, according to a spokeswoman for the Secretary of State's Office.\In Maine's 1st District, Rep. Tom Allen will face off in November against Jane Amero, a Cape Elizabeth Republican and minority leader in the state Senate.\Allen and Amero are running uncontested for their party nominations. State Rep. Adam Mack of Standish, who had previously said he would challenge Amero, never entered the race.\Rep. John Baldacci is also running uncontested, for the Democratic nomination in Maine's 2nd District. But state Rep. Richard Campbell of Holden faces a challenge in the GOP primary in June against Lynwood Winslow of Mapleton.\Winslow is a 30-year-old manager at a New Brunswick company that converts culled potatoes from Maine and Canada into instant or dehydrated potatoes.\Amero campaign chief\A former adviser to Lamar Alexander is moving to Maine to manage Jane Amero's campaign for Congress.\Tim Buckley served as state director of Alexander's short-lived campaign for president in New Hampshire. Previously, he worked on Jeb Bush's winning campaign for governor in Florida, and Bill Zeliff's unsuccessful campaign for governor in New Hampshire.\As campaign manager, Buckley will do everything from scheduling events for Amero to coordinating the campaign message and fund raising.\""She is a bright and tenacious member of the Legislature who has some good ideas and will work every minute of every day to win this seat if that's what it takes,"" said Buckley, who is 34.\Political news online\A former Republican activist from Maine is heading out to the West Coast to help launch a new online political network.\Brent Littlefield, a 29-year-old graduate of the University of Maine, has worked for the National Federation of Independent Business in Washington for the past three years.\But now Littlefield and two other federation workers will help create a Web site in Seattle designed to provide news and information on political issues as well as provide opportunities for users to exchange information.\Rivals.com, a Seattle-based company that now operates a cyber sports network, is creating the political Web site.\Over the years, Littlefield has worked for several Republican politicians, including former Rep.

Bush is smart enough to be president. So here, courtesy of political groupies on the Internet, are some telltale signs that a presidential candidate is underqualified:\5) He promises to improve foreign relations with Hawaii.\4) He runs a series of attack ads against Martin Sheen's character on NBC's ""The West Wing.""\3) He vows to put an end to the war in Pokemon and free the Pikachu refugees once and for all.\2) When anybody mentions Washington, he asks, ""The state or the DC thingie?""\And the Number 1 sign) On the very first question of the debate, he attempts to use a LIFELINE.\QUESTION OF THE WEEK\Presidential contender George W. Bush says he may call for suspension of the 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax hike that was approved by Congress in 1993 to lower the deficit. We asked Maine's representatives in Congress whether they support suspension of that tax as a way to combat high fuel prices.\Sen. Olympia Snowe: ""Yes. I opposed the gas tax when it was created in 1993, and authored an amendment to eliminate it in 1996. I co-sponsored legislation to suspend the diesel tax and testified last week before the Senate Energy Committee advocating this and other approaches to provide consumers relief from high energy prices.""\Rep. Tom Allen: ""No. Since repeal of the gas tax would not increase supply, gas prices would not drop, while oil companies' profits would go up. Gas tax revenues go directly into the highway fund. Repeal would deny Maine $97 million in 2002-03 to build and repair roads and bridges.""\Sen. Susan Collins: ""Yes. I support suspending this tax to provide some relief to consumers, provided the Highway Trust Fund is reimbursed. Suspending the gas tax hike does not, however, address the supply problem, and should be included in a measure urging the president to release some oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.""\Rep. John Baldacci: ""Undecided. I will review this proposal carefully. Steps should be taken to provide tax relief to Maine's farmers, fishermen, small-business owners and families who have been impacted by the rise in fuel costs."""

I have seen him go above and beyond time and time again for the citizens of our city. His efforts to save these seven children are just one example of his attitude of getting it done.\Some people choose to sit and wait, to study an issue for weeks and then decide to do nothing, or wait and see what happens. Chief Chitwood sizes it up, decides what is best to do and then goes out and does it.\I would like to thank Chief Chitwood for the years of fine service that he has given to the city of Portland. I, for one, am glad that he is out there.\Christine Turet\Portland\THIS LETTER is to congratulate Portland Police Chief Michael Chitwood. His recent arrest of a father who has allegedly forced his children to live in filth and squalor is commendable. The day has finally come when children have protection from reported neglect, at least in this city.\Shame on the Department of Human Services -- which took too much time on this case. Thank you, Chief Chitwood, for being the resounding voice for the children. Someone needs to stand up for them. For so long, DHS has not had the time or the guts to stand up for what is right. May Chief Chitwood be an example to them.\Also, let this allegedly neglectful father be an example to all of the parents in this city, letting them know that abusive neglect of their children is a crime we will not take lightly. Thank you to Chief Chitwood for being a pioneer in this field. The policy of ""no blood, no broken bones, no problem"" for so long is disgusting.\The message Chief Chitwood has sent through this arrest is that parents need to provide a clean, nurturing, loving, healthy environment for their children and a failure to do so is abusive and criminal. Chief Chitwood will be a hero to these children, who will also learn that to live in filth and squalor is wrong and that they deserve more in life.\He really has taken a stand for the children, something rarely done in this day and age. Chief Chitwood is a hero. Thank you.\Tina M. Bickart\Portland\Telemarketing law\protects citizens\On April 3, the Portland Press Herald published an editorial criticizing L.D. 2591, ""An Act Relating to Telemarketing.""\That article stated that the bill (passed and signed by the governor) would require a written contract for out-of-state telemarketing sales. To the contrary, Maine's Consumer Solicitation Sales Law has provided for years that any sales contract initiated by a seller over the phone must be in writing to be valid. The bill merely clarified that requirement because it is currently being ignored with some frequency, to the detriment of many Maine citizens.\As a member of the Committee on Utilities and Energy, I can assure you that the committee spent a lot of time on the bill, working closely with the AARP, the Maine Bankers' Association and the Attorney General's Office to ensure that the bill would protect the interests of Maine consumers while placing the least possible burden on legitimate businesses.\State Rep.

She gives the misleading impression that all the technology and sophistication is south of the border and Canadian waiting lists are eternal.\Point of fact: In 1990 (the most recent year studied), there were more liver and bone marrow transplants done in Canada than in the United States and only slightly fewer heart, lung and kidney transplants.\In addition, the overall wait for coronary artery bypass surgery in Ontario was 17 days and the median wait for urgent cases was 1 day . . . the same as in this country.\Perhaps she is unaware that Americans are crossing the border in huge numbers for sophisticated eye surgery done by Canadian ophthalmologists (covered by Canadian but not American insurance companies).\There are compelling arguments for the United States to adopt a single-payer system:\We spend more money on health care per capita than Canada yet have a higher infant mortality, lower life expectancy and 45 million people without health insurance.\Having received my medical training in both Canada and the United States, I, too, choose to live in the United States in spite of our system of medical care.\Richard Herman, M.D.\Physicians for a\National Health Plan\Falmouth\Rollback of gas tax\would help consumers\On April 3, you printed an editorial titled: ""Rolling back gas tax will have little impact on pump prices."" I found this to be an interesting statement since, recently, public radio interviewed an expert on the oil industry who made a statement to the effect that the drop in crude oil prices would have little effect because of the percentage the gas price which is tax.\To me, an almost 10 percent decrease in the price of gasoline is nothing to ignore. This figure is based on the editorial which refers to an 18-cent per gallon tax reduction if the price of gas reaches $2.\If such a reduction in the federal tax was made, combined with a repeal of the recent state increase, that would be something that would benefit consumers.\Ethan McNerney\Lovell\Question about cost\of school bomb threats\Asking parents of children who make bomb threats pay for financial losses (""School district wants to make parents pay for kids' threats,"" April 7) only goes part of the way toward making restitution.\What about the loss of learning due to disruption and/or lost time in class?

226,"Gas tax increase not popular idea\In regard to the letter on Dec. 24 proposing $1-a-gallon gas tax increase, I would like to remind the writer that everyone does not live and work in downtown South Portland.\What would this do to the person who commutes 50 to 60 miles a day to a job that pays perhaps 75 cents over minimum wage? Or to folks on a fixed income who have to travel 10 to 20 miles each way to do their normal shopping? I would suggest that while gas is still inexpensive, the writer should leave his urbanized environment and travel around the state to get a realistic picture of distances involved for people who live in rural areas.\Dana W. Small\Bowdoin\GOV. KING'S consideration of a 5-cent-per-gallon price increase is, to put it mildly, a travesty of justice in this most taxed state in the nation. Neighboring New Hampshire has no income tax, no sales tax and no bottle tax, while ""lucky"" Maine has all three.\Gov. King's rationale is that all the roads money has been depleted. My organization, AREC (Alliance to Roll Back Excessive Charges), has it from state legislative sources that the governor has used the highway money to fund other nonroad purposes. This is but another one of the ways politicians use money to solve problems that should be dealt with up front.\Congratulations to the Portland Press Herald for pointing out Rep. Tom Allen's use of a corporate jet to attend his daughter's wedding when he should have stayed to vote on all the articles of impeachment instead of just the first two.\However, the paper needs to be more diligent in honing the governor's indiscretions, namely the following:\1. Where has all the highway money gone?\2. Why haven't some of the temporary taxes (the one-half percent sales tax, for example) been reduced?\3. Why are we building an expensive school within an equally new expensive new youth center, etc.?\Speaking of schools, where is the funding money for all these communities that need new schools in the state? Speaking of money for schools to build and reduce property taxes, why are we allowing the federal government to spend $48 billion for space programs when we only spend $24 billion for schools?\Where are the priorities of our two female senators? Perhaps they are so concerned with protecting women's rights that they don't have the backbone to look into other things other than searching for a way to censure the president so he can continue to make a mockery of morality and the truth.\Citizens of Maine, speak up for more school funding, more morality, a more sacrosanct reverence for the truth and, above all, more accountability on the part of elected officials.\John Vinagro\President\Alliance to Roll Back Excessive Charges\Kennebunkport\Hire diverse police\for diversity problems\Regarding the Boston Sunday Globe, I saw an article about the Lewiston-Auburn area police and their sensitivity program.\Anytime you have diversity you have cultural and language difficulties.\But let's not get so sensitive that we ask the police to risk their lives trying to read a translator book so as not to hurt someone's feelings before making sure the suspect is unarmed.\The way to solve this problem is not with a ridiculous sensitivity program, but by doing what other cities did. Police departments hired people from diverse cultures and made them police officers, and concentrated them in their respective culture areas. At least then, if a person of same cultural background gets out of line and is busted, he or she can't call it racism, can they?\Also important, there's no excuse of, ""I don't understand the language.""\Frank D.

More flexible enrollment policies, increased guidance and the two-year advanced degree program integral to the concept of community colleges will strengthen education in Maine and develop abilities that will make major contributions to our state.\It is disappointing, however, that these benefits are planned only for areas where educational opportunity already exists. This is only a restructuring of present resources. Remember the inherent function of community colleges is to offer educational opportunities where they are unavailable.\In Bridgton, ""higher"" education is over an hour away via winding roads that must be traveled during long winter nights.\Our region has recently suffered a significant loss of jobs. While we applaud current state efforts to assist our workers, let's look to the future. Establishing a community college here would offer Lake Region residents opportunities that are presently literally beyond their reach. The changes to their lives and the resulting contributions to the economic vitality of this area are beyond calculation.\There is a crying need to bring the concept of community college to outlying areas. I implore Maine's educational leaders to recognize this void and bring these life-changing benefits to those who are most in need of them.\Dee Miller\Bridgton\Reader liked letter\on impeachment\I hope the editor who wrote the editorial in the Dec. 23 issue of your paper will read the letter by Loretta MacKinnon in the same paper (""Looks at resignation and impeachment"").

227,"with sidebar economy\Bill and Gari Bayreuther of Falmouth have suffered through tough economic times.\Two years ago, Bill lost his job as a museum director; he couldn't find work for more than a year.\The couple delayed having a child and stopped taking vacations.\To make ends meet, they were forced to spend the savings they had hoped to use for retirement or for making improvements on their home. It was a time of uncertainty.\""I don't know if I'll ever feel secure after what we've been through,"" said Gari Bayreuther. ""Everybody takes having a job for granted until you don't have one.""\Gari Bayreuther was one of 400 Maine residents interviewed for a poll that revealed continued deep anxiety about the country's economic future.\The economy was cited most frequently as the top issue facing the country today.\Nearly 90 percent of the Maine residents polled said they think American companies will continue to lay off people and restructure their operations to make themselves more competitive.\The poll was conducted by Market Decisions Inc. of South Portland from May 14 through May 20.\It was financed by a grant from the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington, D.C. The poll is part of a cooperative project involving The Portland Newspapers, Maine Public Broadcasting and WGME-TV.\The poll was designed to give voters a chance to express their opinions on national issues ranging from the gas tax and minimum wage to health care reform and the economy. Some of those polled agreed to be interviewed later by a reporter to explain their responses in more detail.\In the eyes of Gari Bayreuther, a 39-year-old Democrat, the problem with the economy is that banks and corporations are just too greedy.\""Why do CEOs have to make $1 million?"" she asked. ""What's wrong with $250,000?\""The corporations that have the most should be giving the most. But they're not,"" she said. ""I don't understand why there's 1 percent of nice people and 99 percent of corporate creeps.""\Altogether, more than 38 percent of the Mainers cited economic issues as their top concern:\15 percent said the economy was the single most important issue facing the country.\12 percent named jobs and unemployment as their top concerns.\Another 12 percent mentioned health care as the most important issue.\11 percent said the federal budget deficit was their most pressing concern.\The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.\The results are similar to the findings of a poll conducted in February. However, far fewer people mentioned the deficit as their top concern in this poll; 23 percent cited the deficit as their top concern in February compared to 11 percent in this month's poll.\Political analysts say concern for the deficit has diminished because it is no longer front-page news, as it was three months ago. Even so, some Maine residents polled remain worried about the budget deficit.\""I think we're really not living within our means,"" said Christine Raines, a retired doctor from Kennebunkport and mother of two grown children. ""We're getting more and more in debt and I don't think that's fair to our children.""\As a way to protect workers against layoffs, the poll results showed strong support for the government to provide tax breaks to companies that maintain decent-paying jobs:\70 percent favored giving tax breaks to companies that avoid layoffs or add employees.\68 percent favored giving tax breaks to companies that pay their workers above-average wages and offer them company-paid benefits.\51 percent supported lowering taxes on businesses so they can earn more moneyand hire more workers.\However, 54 percent of the Maine residents who were polled said they opposed a plan that would require businesses that have contracts with state and local government agencies to pay their employees above-average wages.\And about 63 percent of the people polled also opposed allowing businesses to pay untrained workers below the minimum wage until they build up skills.\There was overwhelming support to increase the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour. Eighty-two percent of the people favored the proposal.\Raising minimum wage\Tommy Rose, a 45-year-old disabled man from Sanford, doesn't work. But his girlfriend did until recently, earning the minimum wage at Marden's. Now she's living on welfare and she's not making much less.\""How can anyone make it on the minimum wage?"" asked Rose.\In the poll, increasing the minimum wage was favored across the board - among all age groups, income levels, and among both men and women. Ninety-two percent of Democrats supported the increase, 86 percent of independents, and 69 percent of Republicans.\Sixty-two percent of the people polled said they do not believe that an increase in the minimum wage would cause employers to eliminate low-paying jobs.\Maine residents were torn over whether Congress should repeal the 4.3-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax that took effect in 1993. Fifty percent favored the repeal; 43 percent opposed it.\""I think we should repeal everything that Clinton has done, including the tax increase,"" said Rob Bundy, a 64-year-old disabled man. Bundy, a Falmouth Republican, described Clinton as the number one problem in the country.\In the poll, the majority of Republicans supported repeal of the gas tax, but the majority of Democrats opposed it. The strongest support for repealing the gas tax came from people who live in northern Maine and people who make less than $25,000 a year.\Forty-seven percent said they did not think that repealing the gas tax would increase the deficit; 40 percent believed it would, and 13 percent didn't know.\The majority of the people polled also believe that the country is facing significant problems in its health care system.\Fifty-eight percent of those people polled believe the country has a health care crisis; 38 percent of the people said the country has health care problems but no crisis. Only two percent said the country doesn't have any health care problems.\Uncertainty on Medicare\Barbara Cratty, a 68-year-old retired homemaker in Old Orchard Beach, worries about potential budget cuts in Medicare and Medicaid programs.\""It's the uncertainty of it all,"" said Cratty. ""I have four grown children and none of them are affluent. And I don't want to burden them if I do become incapacitated.""\Cratty lives alone in a subsidized apartment and receives Medicaid, but she doesn't have a lot of money to spare. She once had cataract surgery, costing her $600, which she said was ""a realblow."" She worries that if she needs medical attention again, she won't have enough money to care for herself.\""If I went into the hospital, it would flatten me,"" she said.\Cratty said she was born with an ""R branded on my butt."" But now she's a Democrat, she said, because she thinks the Republicans represent upper-income people.\The poll showed that women, more than men, believe there is a health care crisis in the country. The poll also indicated that 40 percent of Republicans think there is a health care crisis. In comparison, 69 percent of Democrats and 61 percent of independents believe that the country has a health care crisis.\Chris McDaniel, a 25-year-year independent voter from Bridgton, is among those who believe that the country has major health care problems. He knows the problems firsthand.\Last winter, McDaniel's wife, Julie, went through a difficult pregnancy, which required her to stay in the hospital for three months. Their baby, Kyle, was born prematurely and required surgery and hospitalization.\By the time it was all over, the McDaniel got a bill for $100,000, which has been since reduced to $65,000. They don't have insurance. It was too expensive, and he figured he could pay the costs of the delivery out-of-pocket.\""If you don't pay high premiums, your deductible is out of this world,"" said McDaniel. ""I just think these companies are overcharging and I don't think we get out of them what we put into them.""\On same-sex marriages\The poll also touched on a number of other issues, such as a plan to legally recognize marriages between homosexuals. Nearly 60 percent said they opposed that idea; 30 percent supported it.\""I don't like that all. I just don't think it's moral,"" said Tommy Rose of Sanford.\Welfare reform also generated some strong opinions:\71 percent supported placing a two-year limit on how long someone can receive welfare benefits; 26 percent opposed the idea.\51 percent wanted to require teen-age mothers to live at home in order to receive welfare benefits; 43 opposed the idea.\89 percent favored requiring teen-age mothers to attend school in order to receive welfare benefits; 11 percent opposed it.\But Shirlene Trumble, a 33-year-old single mother of three, who is on welfare, said the number of people on welfare will decrease only when the economy improves and more day care becomes available.\""If I go to work, I can't afford the day care for my kids,"" said Trumble. ""I'd love to be out there working a full-time job, five days a week.""\Maine residents who were polled also opposed a plan to require students to wear uniforms in schools; only 28 percent favored the idea.\""I don't see where that's necessary,"" said George Remillard of New Gloucester, a 69-year-old retired textile worker. ""It's too regimental.""\On other issues:\61 percent supported limiting the number of terms a member of Congress can serve; 28 opposed the idea.\49 percent favored allowing government Medicaid benefits to help pay for abortions for low-income women; 46 percent opposed it.\76 percent supported the death penalty for some murders; 20 percent were opposed.\""If someone takes someone else's life,"" said Remillard, ""they should give their own."""
228," Republicans who map the agenda at the White House and in Congress are hurtling toward a collision over highway funding.\ The vehicle is a bill that designates highway and transit spending formulas for six years. The previous program expired in September and lawmakers who temporarily extended the old law are already more than four months late coming up with a new plan.\ But the problem is how much more to spend through the end of this decade. The previous six-year program totaled $218 billion. President Bush proposed $256 billion for the next six years. The Senate approved $318 billion on Thursday in an overwhelming, bipartisan vote. And House committee leaders proposed $375 billion, although Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., is aiming quite a bit lower.\ As Congress bumped up the numbers, Bush threatened to veto the legislation. His political problem is trying to keep a lid on spending during an election year when conservatives complain about runaway federal deficits of $500 billion in one year, in contrast to a highway bill costing perhaps $300 billion over six years.\ ""This is the first test for the Congress when it comes to spending restraint,"" said Scott McClellan, a Bush spokesman. ""The president's senior advisers will recommend a veto of any highway bill that includes excessive spending and violates these principles, including the bill passed by the Senate.""\ One option was to delay the debate until after the election, when funding might come easier. But the election is also a prominent spur to lawmakers eager to demonstrate to voters what funding they can deliver.\ ""Everybody agrees we need to put much more money into roads, highways, bridges and mass transit,"" said Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo. ""We did not go through this drill for over a year not to get something through.""\ He handed the chairmanship of the Small Business Committee to Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, last year so that he could concentrate on being the Environment and Public Works subcommittee chairman overseeing the highway legislation. The post makes him traffic cop for hundreds of billions of dollars nationwide in a year when he's up for re-election, after he won his last race with 53 percent.\ CONGRESS GAVE ITSELF a Feb. 29 deadline to finish the bill, which it won't meet. But the House on Wednesday gave itself another four months to the end of June - meaning leaders are still angling for approval this year.\ Now Congress and Bush face the prospect of a high-profile mess. Negotiations could collapse because of spending too little to attract winning majorities. Or two-thirds of Congress could approve more spending than Bush can stomach and then override his veto, although such a scenario is considered unlikely in the House.\ Despite the conflicts, the bill's appeal is broad. The Senate voted 76 to 21 in favor.\ Maine stands to get nearly $1.2 billion under the legislation, which is a whopping 33 percent increase from the $876 million under the previous six-year program. Projects that would benefit include the Route 1 bridge linking Waldo and Hancock counties, the Interstate 95 extension in northern Maine and the Gorham bypass.\ ""Few things that we in Congress do this year will have as great of an impact as enacting the reauthorization of the highway bill, that will create jobs, reduce congestion and cut down on highway fatalities,"" Snowe said.\ Under the terms of the bill, states will average a nearly 36 percent increase in highway funding. The smallest increases are Connecticut's 10 percent and Hawaii's 16 percent. The biggest gains go to Colorado at 46 percent and Texas at 42 percent.\ But because states such as Texas historically paid much more to Washington in gas taxes than they received in federal highway funding - and the disparity would continue - the increase still drew complaints.\ ""We are the biggest loser in this bill, to be sure,"" said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.\ THE THORNIEST PROBLEM involves how to fund the bill at a time when the budget deficit is more in one year than the bill spends over six years.\ ""Enough deficit spending my friends. Enough. We are mortgaging our children's futures,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, said during debate on the bill.\ But Senate supporters argue that the bill doesn't increase the deficit because the money comes from the gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon. The Finance Committee outlined several budgetary actions, some questioned by critics of the bill, to increase the flow of money into the highway budget's trust fund.\ ""I think this has become unfortunately a symbol of concern about the rising deficit,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. ""I think it's an unfortunate victim of the times.""\ She said other federal program deserved vetoes, but not investment in highways. She opposed the farm bill two years ago that dramatically increased subsidies, and the energy bill rejected last year that would have tripled industry tax cuts that Bush had proposed.\ ""I don't think the president's figure is realistic, given that this is a six-year transportation bill, the expense of which is largely offset by gasoline tax revenues,"" Collins said.\ The House Transportation Committee, led by chairman Don Young, R- Alaska, and top Democrat Jim Oberstar of Minnesota, backs an increase in the federal gas tax to pay for their $375 billion bill. But they met strong opposition from the House leadership, where Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, echoed Bush in saying he would oppose any tax increase.\ ""This is a bridge too far for me,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said of the Senate bill. ""Probably over time conservatives are going to have to come to grips with the idea that a gas tax increase is going to be the only legitimate way, and honest way, to make up the shortfalls in terms of highway needs.""\ - Staff Writer Bart Jansen can be reached at 202-488-1119 or at bjansen@pressherald.com"

""It's really dependent on that (trail) system and that structure being sound.""\ That's a big reason why lawmakers should back a controversial bill that aims to increase state programming funds for snowmobilers and other off-road recreational vehicle users, said Kilkelly, a longtime advocate of such a measure.\ In fiscal 2001, off-road activities generated an estimated $4.1 million in revenue from the 22-cents-a-gallon tax for the Highway Fund. But only $3 million was allocated to the state agencies that run maintenance and enforcement programs for the activities, leaving clubs and volunteers to do much of the work. The bill aims to make up the difference by increasing annual funds by about $550,000 immediately and by another $550,000 after three years.\ The $1.1 million that the bill requests represents a sliver of the $148 million taken in gas taxes in the last fiscal year. But critics of the bill, such as the King administration and the Maine Better Transportation Association, say as matters stand, there is not enough money to make neccessary improvements to bridges and roads. Bruce Van Note, head policy analyst at the Department of Transportation, says that he already anticipates a $93 million shortfall for the Highway Fund in the next budget cycle.\ Members of the Transportation Committee are expected to voice concerns about the bill at a Monday work session held by the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee.\ Motorboat and all-terrain vehicle users would also benefit if such a bill passed, but snowmobilers have taken the lead on the issue, saying the grooming and policing needs on the state's 12,000 miles of snowmobile trails are particularly acute. A commission that studied the distribution of gasoline tax revenues for off-road activities found snowmobilers got the smallest return in fiscal 2001 - about $958,000 - for the amount of gas tax revenue they raised - $1.8 million.\ Bob Myers, executive director of the Maine Snowmobile Association, also attended the editorial board meeting. He said studies show that snowmobiling is a $300 million industry that generates 2,300 full- time jobs.\ The Maine Audubon Society is supporting the bill, with the hopes that more state funds for off-road activities will mean more resources for enforcing laws on recreational vehicles and protecting the environment.\ The bill's opponents say that driver safety is at risk if transportation projects get less money from the Highway Fund. Also, state and towns will have to post pothole-riddled roads, bringing hardship to businesses whose heavy trucks would be diverted from traffic, critics say.\ Kate Dufour of the Maine Municipal Association, which also opposes the bill, suggested that off-road activities be covered by the general fund. She said the activities spur economic development, especially in the northern and eastern part of the state, so they should be funded by a source that typically deals with economic initiatives.\ A minority of the commission has offered an alternative proposal to the bill. They say that more money raised by the gas tax should go to off-road recreation only if ""new, substantial, ongoing"" revenue is set aside for the Highway Fund.\ Staff writer Josie Huang can be contacted at 791-6364 or at:\ jhuang@pressherald.com"
232,"A Republican bill would impose and annual registration tax on hybrid and all-electric vehicles to help fund state highway repairs. The measure is vehemently opposed by hybrid and electric vehicle owners, who feel they are being unfairly targeted.\The LePage administration is proposing to make it more expensive to own a hybrid or electric vehicle in Maine. \The Maine Department of Transportation wants to impose an annual registration fee on the vehicles, $150 for gas-electric hybrid cars and $250 for all-electric models. \An extra fee is needed to make hybrid and all-electric owners pay their fair share of state road repairs that are funded through a tax on gasoline sales, said Meghan Russo, manager of legislative services for the MDOT. \""The idea is that the owners of these types of vehicles are paying far less in the gas tax than other vehicle owners and they are using the highway system just like any others,"" Russo said. ""There has got to be a way to try and capture revenue from those drivers who are using our road system."" \Outraged conservation groups and vehicle owners said they believe the legislation deliberately targets them for protecting the environment and their wallets without really addressing the state's chronically underfunded highway fund. \Hybrid and all-electric vehicles account for less than 3 percent of all passenger vehicles in Maine, according to statistics from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. \""I feel like I am being punished if this bill goes through because I am doing the right thing,"" said Gretchen Ebbesson-Keegan, a retired teacher from Camden. \Ebbesson-Keegan, 72, has a 9-year-old Toyota Prius she uses to get around town, averaging about 25 miles a week. The proposal feels to her like part of an effort by some Republican politicians to stymie growth in renewable energy and green technology. \""At some point, we have to take a stand on transitioning to alternative energy,"" she said. ""They need to come up with a way to take care of the roads that does not set people against one another."" \NEW FEES WOULD STILL LEAVE GAP \News that owning his Nissan Leaf might become more expensive took Mark Marchesi by surprise. Marchesi bought his car a year and a half ago to commute and run errands in South Portland, where he takes advantage of free charging stations the city provides. A new fee would make him rethink owning an all-electric car, Marchesi said. \""I think that goes against what you are trying to achieve by driving an electric vehicle,"" he said. ""If you are trying to save on gas and you are getting an extra tax on top of it, it kind of defeats the purpose. It feels really unfair to me."" \New registration fees on about 19,450 hybrid and electric vehicles in Maine could raise about $2.9 million annually for highway repairs, according to Bureau of Motor Vehicles statistics. Even with fees contained in L.D. 1806, the state would still be tens of millions of dollars short of closing its highway funding gap. \Maine, like other states, has for years grappled with declining revenue from the state gasoline tax, which is 30 cents per gallon in Maine. The state's highway maintenance is underfunded by $60 million a year, even after borrowing roughly $100 million annually since 2016 to cover the highway budget. \Officials know fees alone won't solve the problem, but they want to start a discussion about future revenue, Russo said. \""We think drivers should be paying some sort of fee, let's talk about what amount would be appropriate,"" she said. \OTHER FUNDING IDEAS PROPOSED \Eighteen states have registration fees on electric and hybrid vehicles, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Maine's proposed fees would be the highest in the country - other states range from $30 to $100 for hybrids and $50 to $200 for electric cars, Russo said. \The LePage administration also proposed a bill to redirect 12 percent of the sales tax on automobile and automobile parts to the highway fund, but the measure is unlikely to pass because of concerns it will blow a hole in the state budget, Russo said. The two bills together could raise roughly $30 million a year, she said. \Another bill floated by Rep. Andrew McLean, D-Gorham, last year and set to be debated again this session would add fees for hybrid and electric cars, but also increase the gas tax, add registration fees and divert some sales taxes to the highway fund. \However, any increase of the gas tax, which hasn't changed since 2011, is a nonstarter for the LePage administration. \""This administration has been very clear, they are opposed to a gas tax increase,"" Russo said. \WHAT ABOUT FUEL-SIPPING GAS CARS? \Defeating the bill is a top priority for the state's environmental groups, said Dylan Voorhees, climate and clean energy director for the National Resources Council of Maine. \Instead of attempting new approaches to fund Maine's roads and bridges, the LePage administration is trying to divert attention from the problem by making scapegoats out of electric and hybrid owners, Voorhees said. Focusing on electric and hybrid cars ignores the fact that some conventional gasoline-engine vehicles get nearly as good fuel economy, he said. \""It is a really a very arbitrary way to go about it that reveals that this bill is not about opening a conversation about fair rates, it is punitive,"" he said. ""This bill will do virtually nothing to bring in revenue to solve this problem."" \Instead of sticking owners with an extra fee, the state should rethink how it pays for its roads, said Tony Giambro, an owner of Paris Autobarn, a service center and used car business that specializes in hybrids and electric vehicles. \The state could levy taxes based on mileage or by weight, to make sure drivers who use the roads a lot, or heavy vehicles that damage roads, pay their fair share, Giambro said. \""We don't want to get away with not paying road tax, we want to contribute to maintenance of the roads. We would prefer to have the entire system of road tax be changed,"" said Giambro, who owns an all-electric Kia. \""We want to pay our fair share, but it needs to be done the right way,"" he said.

233,"AUGUSTA -- If legislators hadn't voted to adjourn at 2 a.m. Sunday, the Senate might still be debating the term limits bill.\While leaving their electoral longevity in limbo, the lawmakers addressed a slew of bills over the five-month session, passing a state budget, which Gov. Angus S. King has signed into law, that provides local school funding relief and a boost to the University of Maine System; approving a gas tax increase that will provide funds for road and bridge improvements; and legislating a number of bills that affect individual residents from smokers to hunters to women who buy contraceptives.\The lawmakers also dealt with political issues, voting themselves a 3 percent pay raise, easing requirements for third parties to get on the ballot and requiring that voting booths be handicapped- accessible.\As the hour grew later and later Saturday night, Senate Democrats tried to resuscitate a bill to relax term limits that made it through the House, but stalled in the upper chamber. Republicans begged party faithfuls to stay at their posts so the bill could not slip through at the last minute. To conclude the endless debate, exhausted senators finally agreed to postpone a decision on the measure until June 18, when both houses come back for veto day, to learn the fate of the many bills that still await the governor's signature.\Despite a number of votes to kill the term-limits measure, it still could find its way to the November ballot, according to Senate Minority Leader Jane Amero of Cape Elizabeth, one of eight senators who would be removed by the current bill. Amero led the fight to kill the bill, which she termed ""self-serving"" to endangered legislators.\""I have not had a single call from a constituent asking me to extend my term,"" Amero said.\Leading the fight for the bill was Majority Leader Chellie Pingree, D-North Haven, who said the issue became politicized after it was recommended by a 12-1 committee vote. Pingree, who also will be barred from running under the current law, said she has always opposed term limits as bad policy.\""I don't think the people of Knox County or any other county should be told who they can and cannot vote for,"" she said.\The pending bill would have sent a proposal to referendum to extend the current term limit of eight years to 12 years. In the convoluted weekend of multiple votes, Sen. Peter Mills, R-Skowhegan, found himself voting against the bill he sponsored. In the last and final vote, the measure failed 17-16, when Sen. Vinton E. Cassidy returned from stretching his legs to rescue a 16-16 vote, which would have allowed the bill to proceed.\Senate President Mark Lawrence allowed the revote, possibly saving the Calais Republican from a lynching at the hands of fellow Republicans.\During the weekend of seemingly endless debate on the issue, several senators changed sides.\Sen. Susan Longley, D-Liberty, couldn't quite make up her mind. On Friday she voted against the bill. On Saturday, she voted for the referendum to ""let the people decide."" In the final analysis, the potential loss of skilled, veteran legislators decided the question, she said.\The bill's sponsor apologized for his change of heart. While agreeing that the change to 12 years is warranted, Mills concluded that having legislators vote to extend their own terms was unethical. He said the issue should go to the public, but not when the interest of four-termers hangs in the balance.\""The issue should be decided isolated from our own fortunes. In a year when the Legislature voted itself a 3 percent pay increase, the issue would fast become a fight over our selfish motives,"" Mills said.\To former allies on the issue, including Pingree, who were hurt by his change, Mills issued his ""deep regrets."" He said he made his own decision and ""no one got to me.""\Mill's seatmate, Sen Joel Abromson, R-Portland, said legislators voting to send the issue to referendum with their own service hanging in the balance would be ""self-serving.""\An amendment offered by Sen Rick A. Bennett, R-Norway, which would have excluded any sitting legislator from the change, was eventually rejected.\The term limit, if unchanged, would force major changes in the Senate. Those barred from seeking another term would include Senate President Lawrence, Majority Leader Pingree and Minority Leader Amero along with Richard J. ""Spike"" Carey, D-Belgrade; Philip E. Harriman, R-Yarmouth; R. Leo Kieffer, R-Caribou; Carol O. Kontos, D-Windham; and Judy Ayotte Paradis, D-Frenchville.\Bipartisan spirit\At the conclusion of the five-month session early Sunday morning, House Speaker G. Steven Rowe said legislators of both parties surprised critics.\""At the beginning of the session, many skeptics wondered whether we would ever finish our work. With more than 2,900 bill submissions, some predicted that we wouldn't finish by July 1, let alone in a shortened session. But we proved them wrong. In comparison with other sessions, both Democrats and Republicans worked together on the budget and other thorny questions,"" Rowe said.\An independent senator says lawmakers' clear vision of what needed to be done when they came to work in January -- boosting school aid and dealing with sales and gas taxes -- kept State House business on track.\""The session was kind of low-key,"" said independent Sen. Jill Goldthwait of Bar Harbor, noting that even on some of the most emotionally explosive issues such as abortion and the death penalty, Senate debate was muted.\On the budget front, senators on both sides of the aisle credited a bipartisan spirit for helping to resolve differences over the two- year spending plan. Lawmakers passed the $4.4 billion Part 1 budget in April that continued state funding at existing levels. The Part 2 budget Gov. King signed into law Friday provides additional money for new and existing programs.\The new budget cuts the state sales tax from 5.5 percent to 5 percent effective July 1, 2000. It adds to the Rainy Day Fund and increases the personal exemption on state income tax to $2,850. It restores the circuitbreakers renters' benefit to 18 percent and fully funds tax breaks for businesses purchasing machinery and equipment.\The budget increases aid to local school districts by nearly $41 million and provides almost $24 million for school renovations. The University of Maine System will receive nearly $23 million for economic improvements and capital projects.\The Legislature sent to King a bill to bar municipalities from suing gun manufacturers to head off such lawsuits as those inspired by the shootings in Littleton, Colo. Those pushing the ban see the suits as a form of back-door gun control.\Along with bond issues for public land purchases and transportation improvements, lawmakers sent a couple of initiated bills to voters. One bans certain late-term abortions, and the other seeks to allow the medical use of marijuana.\Personal effects\New laws enacted by the Legislature will affect smokers, children riding bikes, tipsy snowmobilers and boaters, hunters, lobstermen, unemployed workers and women who buy contraceptives.\One law will bar smokers from lighting up in restaurants. By early September, restaurant smoking sections will be a thing of the past in Maine.\Shoppers will no longer have direct access to cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products, except in tobacco specialty stores and businesses where minors are not allowed, thanks to legislative action.\One thousand more hunters will get permits to shoot a moose, bringing the maximum tally to 3,000 as of this fall. In a major policy shift, lawmakers also turned over management of the annual six-day moose hunt to the state fish and game department.\Another new law will let any-deer permit winners transfer their permits to junior hunters or hunters 65 or over, and three people will be able to hunt together without being guilty of driving deer.\Lobstermen won the right to set 100 more traps each as of next year. But lawmakers also opted to keep intact a lobster-conservation measure calling for larger escape vents as of June 1.\To prevent gear conflicts between lobstermen and scallopers, lawmakers shortened the scalloping season by a month.\Hoping to curb deaths and injuries related to outdoor activities, lawmakers increased fines for operating snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles and watercraft while under the influence of alcohol to levels paid by drunken highway motorists.\A law prompted by a Deering High School student's fatal accident will make it illegal for anyone under 19 years old to ride in a pickup truck bed on a public roadway. Children under 16 will be required to wear helmets when they are riding their bicycles, although the law has no enforcement provisions.\Another new law says fines can be imposed for misusing laser pointers by aiming them at people to harass or annoy them.\On the labor front, Maine's fund that pays benefits to unemployed workers was saved from insolvency by readjustments of taxes paid by employers and benefits received by workers. It will mean higher taxes for some employers, but lower taxes for others. Benefits, likewise, will rise for some recipients and drop for others.\In action that supporters describe as a national model, victims of sexual assaults, stalking or domestic violence will be able to take unpaid leaves from work to get counseling, medical attention or protection orders without fear of losing their jobs.\The session passed bills to reform Worker's Compensation, increase the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15, and exempt public pensions by transferring taxes to high-income Social Security recipients.\After some initial hesitation, Gov. Angus King signed a bill requiring contraceptives to be covered in health insurance packages that include prescription drugs. Another bill contains provisions protecting individuals' health care information.\Mainers will live in a cleaner environment thanks to reauthorization of a law setting voluntary goals for pollution reduction.\Rejected or withdrawn\The session rejected bills to establish the death penalty, require trigger locks in houses shared by children, eliminate ""cut and run"" forest practices, and remove methyl-tertiary butyl ether from gasoline.\Bills that were killed or withdrawn include ones making English the official state language, keeping petitioners at least 250 feet from polling places, establishing a longer waiting period before granting divorces, recognizing covenant marriages and testing prison inmates for HIV.\Other bills axed in the session would have repealed the ""snack tax,"" stockpiled food for Y2K problems, barred use of juveniles in tobacco stings, increased cigarette taxes by 63 cents a pack, eliminated Maine Turnpike tolls and abolished the Turnpike Authority, and made halogen headlights illegal.\The Associated Press contributed to this story."
234,"People don't like higher taxes, and Mainers are no exception. It's not surprising, then, that Gov. King's proposed 5-cent gas tax hike has met with some grumbling from citizens and state legislators.\Seizing on this discontent, three GOP lawmakers have put forward an alternative proposal for plugging a $35 million hole in the state's highway fund. State Sens. Vinton Cassidy, R-Calais, Peter Mills, R-Skowhegan, and Philip Harriman, R-Yarmouth, want to use a portion of the tax charged on new vehicle sales to pay for highway construction.\The senators deserve credit for not just complaining, but for bringing forward an alternative. There is some logic, too, in tying vehicle sales to money for roads and bridges. Their idea, however, has some serious flaws. Strong and steady should be the rule for setting aside money to fix state roads. In good times and bad, roads and bridges deteriorate, and not keeping up with maintenance can be costly. State tax revenues from vehicle sales, meanwhile, are extremely volatile. People don't buy new cars in tough times, and these receipts drop off dramatically as a result.\The three GOP senators envision projected surpluses covering the loss to the general fund under their plan. Their logic, then, is that it makes little sense to raise a tax in time of surplus. However, surplus dollars would be better used to make good on the Legislature's promise to lower the sales tax rate to 5 percent.\Gov. King's proposed 5-cent gas tax hike remains the better idea for propping up the highway fund. It will help the environment by discouraging fuel consumption and will raise money directly from the folks who use the highways. Lawmakers should give the gas tax hike their support."
235,"Legislators have to step up and make sure Maine has the money to maintain its sadly deteriorated roads and bridges.\Our roads have taken a real beating this winter, made worse by years of deferred maintenance. So, too, have our bridges, rail lines, airports and seaports lacked proper maintenance. Our statewide transportation infrastructure is suffering, and the cost of delaying fixes is only making matters worse. But in order to make these fixes, state leaders in Augusta must have an honest conversation about our needs. \Every time we fuel up at the pump, we pay state and federal gas taxes. The federal gas tax has remained unchanged at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993, and our state gas tax is below the national average. The needs of our transportation system, however, have not remained constant. In fact, our needs have grown dramatically - roads are crumbling, bridges are deficient and we're not making the smart, strategic plans needed to effectively move people and goods from place to place. \Moreover, Mainers are driving in cars that are becoming increasingly more fuel-efficient. This is good for our environment and our health, but it means that we're buying fewer gallons of gas per vehicle. When we buy less gas, we contribute fewer dollars over the course of the year to the Highway Fund, the pot of money used to finance the maintenance and construction of our roads and bridges. \The stagnant gas tax has led to an annual unmet capital funding need of $150 million. This means we are $150 million short of funding our most basic transportation needs. This is not a ""pie-in-the-sky"" number. It's a basic ""take-care-of-what-you-have"" figure that does not include money for any new roads or long-term transformational projects. \Today, we are bonding for many of our road maintenance needs. While bonding is a viable financing option, it should be used for long-term projects, not year-to-year maintenance. If nothing is done about the capital funding need, the condition of our roads today in Maine will be terrific compared to what they will look like in five years. \The long-term neglect of our transportation system has set Maine's economy back. A 21st-century economy needs a 21st-century transportation network. After these two years on the Transportation Committee, nothing could be more clear: We need to invest in our transportation system - and soon. \Imagine the Maine economy without the interstate, our three cargo ports, rail service to Aroostook or the Portland and Bangor airports. What would our midcoast economy look like without the Sagadahoc or Penobscot Narrows bridges? \What is the cost of posted roads and bridges that force motorists and truckers to find longer, alternative routes? What are the costs of time-consuming delays in traffic-congested areas such as Gorham and Westbrook or Augusta and Waterville? And what about the extraordinary expenses and loss of productivity associated with accidents because of unsafe conditions and the auto repair costs we incur every year from the cavernous holes in our roads? \The sticker price to fix our transportation infrastructure is shocking to a lot of people - and this sticker price doesn't include the additional modernization that we need. But the cost of failing to fix our transportation system is far greater than the cost of properly maintaining it. This is an area where pragmatic people - regardless of political party - should be able to find common ground. \By providing for a 21st-century transportation system, we can save money by paying less for traffic delays that take away time from family and work; lost jobs with companies that cannot afford Maine's transportation deficiencies; accidents with personal injury or loss of life, and higher insurance rates or car repairs for bent wheel rims, tie rods, front-end alignments and the like. \Ensuring the vitality of our transportation system is not a partisan issue. It's a Maine issue. We know we cannot stay on this bumpy road for much longer. The next Legislature must take steps to close the transportation funding gap and make smart plans to rebuild our roads and bridges that will reduce our long-term costs and grow our economy. How we do this is a different conversation, but it is one that is taking place. \-- Special to the Press Herald"
236,"House votes\Democratic Reps. Mike Michaud (2nd District) and Chellie Pingree (1st District)\Vote 1: UNEMPLOYMENT AID EXTENDED: The House passed the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act (HR 3548), sponsored by Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., to amend the Supplemental Appropriations Act by providing additional emergency unemployment compensation assistance on a temporary basis. Proponents said the continued record levels of unemployment in many states made it necessary to extend the period during which former workers could continue to qualify for unemployment funds beyond the 26-week period provided in current law. Opponents said that unemployment benefits ""contribute to long-term unemployment ... by providing an incentive, and the means, not to work."" The vote, on Sept. 22, was 331 yeas to 83 nays.\YEAS: Michaud, Pingree\Vote 2: SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS EXTENSION: The House approved a bill (HR 3614), sponsored by Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., to temporarily extend Small Business Administration programs through the end of October while Congress continued its review of them in a regular authorization bill. Proponents said the bill ""makes two critical changes to help small businesses"" by reforming processes for funding and making loans. The vote, on Sept. 23, was 417 yeas to 2 nays.\YEAS: Michaud, Pingree\Vote 3: EXTENDING SURFACE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS: The House approved the Surface Transportation Extension Act (HR 3617), sponsored by Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., to extend federal surface transportation programs for three months pending the passage of a longer extension. Proponents said the bill would ensure continuity of existing investments in surface transportation needs and would provide opportunities to continue working out the issues of delivering services more effectively in coming years. Opponents said a three-month extension was insufficient and that it was proposed only ""to buy time to bring the parties together to the table to agree on a gas tax."" The vote, on Sept. 23, was 335 yeas to 85 nays.\YEAS: Michaud, Pingree\Vote 4: FAIR MEDICARE PREMIUMS: The House passed the Medicare Premium Fairness Act (HR 3631) sponsored by Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., to provide, in a budget-neutral manner, a consistent 2010 Medicare Part B premium. Proponents said the legislation was needed to protect Medicare beneficiaries who would receive decreased Social Security payments next year. Opponents said that they did not oppose helping affected Medicare beneficiaries, but that they were concerned about the precedent of tapping the Medicare Trust Fund without proper congressional hearings, since this fund is already running a projected deficit and will be used up next decade unless Congress acts to restore its fiscal health. The vote, on Sept. 24, was 406 yeas to 18 nays.\YEAS: Michaud, Pingree\Senate votes\Republican Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins\Vote 1: DELAY OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING: The Senate rejected a motion to send the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (HR 2996) back to committee with a requirement that the full Senate wanted a provision included that would have stopped Interior Department funding for delaying the implementation of the Draft Proposed Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. The amendment, sponsored by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., would have effectively allowed the oil and gas program to move forward. Proponents said that there was overwhelming public support for initiatives to immediately begin new domestic offshore oil and gas exploration. Opponents said the motion would have required the committee, and the Senate, to take an action that could prevent the Obama administration from presenting its own plan for outer continental shelf oil and gas exploration and instead to allow the outdated Bush administration plan to be implemented. The vote, on Sept. 23, was 56 yeas to 42 nays.\NAYS: Collins, Snowe\Vote 2: EARMARKS IN SAVE AMERICA'S TREASURES PROGRAM: The Senate tabled an amendment to the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (HR 2996), sponsored by Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to eliminate all congressional earmarks from the Save America's Treasures program, thereby restoring it to its original status as a competitive grant program. Proponents of tabling said that the funds for preservation were intended to be given to historic sites through a national competitive grant process, but that more than half the funds would be diverted to specific projects not based on their merits. Opponents to tabling said that the earmarked projects were thoroughly vetted by the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and that the projects met all the applicable competitive criteria. The vote to table the amendment, on Sept. 23, was 72 yeas to 26 nays.\YEAS: Collins, Snowe\Vote 3: CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS: The Senate rejected an amendment, sponsored by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., to the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (HR 2996) that would have prevented the assistant to the president for energy and climate change from directing the actions of any departments or agencies that received funding under the legislation. Proponents noted that Congress already had oversight in place with Cabinet-level appointees and that having presidential staff members operating as White House ""czars"" interfered with this established process. Opponents of the amendment said ""it is not unusual for a president to have high-level staff members in the White House who help to coordinate policy issues that touch a number of federal agencies"" and that the current congressional appointees had the greater level of control, rendering the amendment unnecessary. The vote, on Sept. 24, was 57 yeas to 41 nays.\YEAS: Snowe\NAYS: Collins\Vote 4: MAINTENANCE FUNDS FOR NATIONAL PARKS: The Senate tabled an amendment, sponsored by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., to the Interior and Environment Appropriations Act (HR 2998) that would have moved $400 million from an account set up to acquire new park lands into the national park maintenance fund so that existing facilities awaiting repair could be improved before new lands are purchased. Proponents said that money for maintaining existing national parks was included in the legislation along with money to acquire additional lands and that it would be unwise to forgo opportunities for purchasing land that might be sold for commercial purposes instead of being preserved. Opponents said that it was ""common sense"" to spend limited funds to fix existing maintenance problems in national parks before acquiring additional lands. The vote, on Sept. 23, was 79 yeas to 19 nays.\YEAS: Collins, Snowe\Vote 5: INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT APPROPRIATIONS: The Senate passed the Department of the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (HR 2996), sponsored by Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., that set appropriations levels for fiscal year 2010 for the Interior Department and related agencies. Proponents called the legislation ""fair, balanced, and workable,"" noting that the bill would provide $32.1 billion in nonemergency discretionary funding in five key areas: water and sewer infrastructure, wildfire suppression and prevention on public land, supporting public land management agencies, investment in the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and aiding Indian country. There was $3.6 billion allocated for water and sewer infrastructure projects, $1.8 billion for wildland fire suppression activities, $6 billion for basic operations and backlog maintenance of national parks, national forests, national wildlife refuges, and on Bureau of Land Management land, $419 million for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and $6.6 billion for the Indian Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

237,"The five gubernatorial candidates on Maine's ballot tried to woo business leaders Thursday during separate forums in two regions that will be critical in November's election.\Before hundreds of chamber of commerce members in Lewiston and Bangor, the candidates sparred about topics such as the state's business climate, its budget deficit, job creation, health care costs and welfare.\With recent polls showing Republican Paul LePage and Democrat Libby Mitchell in a close race, independent Eliot Cutler cast himself as an alternative to both, while independents Shawn Moody and Kevin Scott said they are outsiders with needed business experience.\They first met early Thursday morning at the Ramada Conference Center in Lewiston for a breakfast and forum, hosted by the Androscoggin County Chamber of Commerce and attended by more than 400 people.\Asked to rate the state's business climate on a scale of one to 10, from worst to best, Cutler started out by rating it ""about two."" LePage gave it ""about three""; Scott said ""two to three, maybe""; and Moody said, ""two to three."" Mitchell gave the state's business climate a five.\""A lot of it is how we see ourselves, and we need to create a culture of how to make businesses grow,"" said Mitchell, Maine's Senate president.\LePage, the mayor of Waterville and general manager of the Marden's discount chain, said the key to helping businesses is to review and relax state regulations and to lower utility costs by looking ""at all forms of energy.""\LePage also said he's not a politician or a lobbyist, but a ""businessman who has served his community as mayor.""\In a swipe at Mitchell's assertion that Maine's economy has been hurt by a ""global recession,"" LePage pointed to Mitchell's three decades of service in the Legislature. ""We've been in a recession for 35 years; it's time we change direction,"" he said.\Cutler cited reducing energy costs, health care and changing government, while Scott said he would ""reach out to corporations"" to attract new businesses while ""cultivating an environment of professional business analysis.""\Moody said he would work on a ""small-business stimulus package,"" while focusing on lowering health care costs by attracting more insurance companies to the state.\Asked how they would address an anticipated state budget deficit of at least $800 million, the candidates offered few specifics.\LePage said the state could save ""hundreds of millions"" by reforming welfare, while Mitchell said about $250 million could be cut by not funding schools at the 55 percent level.\Cutler assailed the recent ""balanced"" state budgets as not being truly balanced because costs were shifted onto towns, schools and others, and said borrowing has ballooned the state's debt.\""We need to stop digging the hole deeper, making promises, which is what my opponents are doing. I never thought I'd be the only fiscal conservative in this race, but I am,"" Cutler said, getting a chuckle from LePage.\Scott cast the other candidates as part of an establishment that has led the state to an economic ""train wreck,"" saying he represents the positive, innovative solution as someone who places engineers with technology firms.\""We've heard from the cheerleaders; I am a player and I play in the high-tech industry,"" Scott said.\Moody floated his proposal to turn the Department of Health and Human Services into the department of health and human ""resources,"" saying people who need state assistance should be given ""a lifeline, not a lifestyle.""\Asked about welfare, Moody said the focus should be on getting recipients back to work as soon as possible. He noted that he sees many tall weeds as he drives on Maine's highways. ""Somebody could pull those out,"" he said.\Cutler said the state must end welfare's ""cliff"" effect, in which general assistance recipients aren't ""weaned"" off aid.\LePage proposed a five-year lifetime limit on welfare so it's ""a transition, not a career.""\Welfare recipients could work at soup kitchens and hospitals, he said, and ""we need to get them working and off the couch.""\Scott countered that 40 percent of the state's welfare recipients are working, and that he would take a ""business analysis"" approach by examining people ages 18 to 45 to ""find out who's not working and why.""\None of the candidates committed to raising any specific taxes, though Cutler said an increase in the gas tax and more tolls should be considered to meet transportation needs. Mitchell said she would continue to pursue ways of lowering the state income tax, noting that voters rejected the Legislature's proposal to do that by expanding the sales tax to additional goods and services.\""It costs money to reduce this tax,"" Mitchell said.\On Thursday evening, the candidates met again to discuss business issues, before the Bangor Region Chamber of Commerce.\At Husson University's Gracie Theatre, the candidates were asked to specify one tax they would cut if they could.\Mitchell, LePage and Cutler all said the income tax, while Scott said he would lower the property tax. Moody said it's just not realistic to talk about lowering taxes while the state faces significant budget problems.\""If we can hold the line on taxes, that would be a good goal in itself,"" he said.\All pledged not to raise broad-based taxes while the economy is struggling and before the budget stabilizes. LePage took it a step further, saying he would not raise fees to balance the budget.\The Bangor chamber asked the candidates whether they would resort to shutdown days if they got into a battle with the Legislature.\""A state shutdown would be a total failure for any governor,"" Mitchell said. ""It's radioactive.""\LePage said he has worked with Democrats in Waterville, so he believes he knows how to handle members of the opposition party. While saying shutdown days would not be his ""preferred way to operate,"" he wouldn't rule them out.\""I am never going to say never when it comes to shutdown,"" he said.\The debate started on a political note, when Cutler called on voters to consider voting for the best person, not against another candidate.\""I know some of you are concerned about Paul becoming governor, so you want to vote for Libby to keep him from becoming governor,"" Cutler said as he noted that some fear Mitchell so they are voting for LePage.\That prompted a response from Mitchell.\""Who will you vote for if you're afraid of Eliot?"" she asked as Scott raised his hand.\MaineToday Media State House Writer Susan Cover can be contacted at 620-7015 or at:\scover@centralmaine.com\[Sidebar]\THERE IS MORE POLITICAL NEWS INSIDE\BILL NEMITZ WRITES: Far-fetched ethics complaints indicate gubernatorial campaigns are in the silly season.

The proposal could help provide cities like Portland with money for road improvements. Otherwise, we have to rely on property taxes to correct traffic pathways and repair wear and tear due largely to motor vehicle traffic.\Increased fuel efficiency has allowed reduced tax revenue per vehicle mile.

I would suggest that Vickrey misunderstands the issue.\No municipality has to offer a TIF to any business at any time. It is completely within that municipality's control. In many cases, the residents determine whether to offer a TIF at town meeting. It is a matter of local control.\TIFs are virtually the only method for municipalities to compete for business in Maine, nationally and internationally. And that competition is stiff. For example, in some parts of the country, towns can offer to buy a company land, build a building or provide all sorts of free municipal services.\Mr. Vickrey writes that taxes are a ""zero-sum game"" with companies receiving local services without having to pay for them. In reality, most TIFs in Maine go to community benefit for such things as infrastructure improvements. TIFs are not necessarily designed to attract new jobs. They are sometimes used to preserve existing jobs.\While Mr. Vickrey's point about changes in the economy is well taken, it is important for everyone not to lose sight of the continued need for economic diversity.

239," PORTLAND -- Poll results published Sunday show strong support among Mainers for raising the minimum wage, weaker support for repealing the federal gasoline tax, and a consistent concern over economic issues.\ The poll for The Portland Newspapers, WGME-TV and Maine Public Broadcasting, the second of four planned before the November election, also reveals a strong belief that the nation faces a health care crisis.\ Four hundred people were contacted by Market Decisions Inc. of South Portland between May 14 and 20 for the survey, which was financed by a grant from the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington. The results have a margin of error of 5 percentage points, plus or minus.\ Fifteen percent of those interviewed said the economy was their top concern, while 12 percent listed health care and another 12 percent cited jobs and employment. Eleven percent put the federal budget deficit at the top of their list of concerns.\ The results are similar to those of a poll conducted in February, although fewer people in the newer survey mentioned the deficit as the nation's biggest problem. The survey results were published in the Maine Sunday Telegram.\ Filling out the list of top concerns of Mainers surveyed in the May poll were: Crime and morals-values, 7 percent each; education, 5 percent; foreign policy, 4 percent; welfare, 3 percent, taxes, 2 percent; and environment, 1 percent.\ On the minimum wage, 82 percent said they favored an increase from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour, while 16 percent opposed it. Fifty percent supported a repeal of the 4.3-cent-per-gallon federal gas tax, while 43 percent said it should stay in effect.\ Forty-two percent said they were better off than they were four years ago, while 32 percent said they were in worse shape and 24 percent said they were about the same.\ Asked which group is benefiting the most from today's economy, 78 percent said the rich, 7 percent said the middle class, 9 percent said the poor and 6 percent had no answer.\ On social issues, 59 percent of those responding opposed government recognition of gay marriages, while 30 percent favored it and 12 percent had no opinion or no answer.\ The poll also showed 58 percent believed the nation has a health care crisis, 38 percent believe it has health care problems, but no crisis, and 2 percent believe it has no health care problem."

\
AUGUSTA -- A $2.2 billion shortfall in the state Department of Transportation over the next 10 years has got people at the Statehouse thinking.
\
More tolls?
\
Less mowing?
\
Get rid of some administrators?
\
Maybe, all of the above.
\
The mini-firestorm created by the Transportation Committee's decision last month to study charging tolls on the interstate points to a larger problem within the state's transportation system.
\
There isn't enough money coming in from the federal government, or the gas tax, or from anywhere else, to adequately cover road and bridge needs over the next 10 years.
\
One possible solution is to combine the state DOT with the independent Maine Turnpike Authority, some say.
\
Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, and Sen. Karl Turner, R-Cumberland, both want to look at that idea. For his part, Baldacci said all transportation authorities -- port, rail and turnpike -- need to be on the table.
\
""We have a lot of authorities,"" he said. ""There needs to be a housecleaning with all these administrations.""
\
Turner, a key member of the Legislature's Appropriations Committee, said it only makes sense to consider consolidating the agencies.
\
""When you start thinking about efficiency in government and organizations within state government who do the same thing, there's considerable overlap between the turnpike authority and DOT,"" Turner said.
\
Maine isn't the only state considering a massive overhaul of its transportation systems. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is proposing to create a new agency that puts all transportation systems under one authority.
\
Baldacci drew a line in the sand by rejecting any consideration of putting a toll on the interstate. Instead, he's directed the DOT to find ways to save money, and wants to put pressure on the federal government to provide more money for the highway system.
\
""To ask the citizens of Maine to be taxed or tolled more to make up for the federal government is unconscionable,"" he said.
\
His immediate dismissal of the toll idea caught many in the transportation community by surprise.
\
""It was baffling really, because they are just trying to see what tools are out there,"" said Maria Fuentes, executive director of the Maine Better Transportation Association, a group whose members include transportation construction and supplier firms, rail companies, trucking and shipping interests, bus companies, and travel interests.
\
ONE MISSION, TWO AGENCIES
\
The problem Baldacci and lawmakers are trying to solve is how to efficiently manage roads and bridges, which are paved, plowed and paid for by two different agencies with a common mission.
\
Both the turnpike authority and Maine DOT work to keep the roads safe and in good condition to support the transport of goods and services, as well as tourists and locals.
\
Yet the Maine DOT is facing a huge shortfall, and the turnpike authority is self-supporting. Maine DOT is responsible for more than 8,400 miles of road, and the turnpike authority maintains a 109-mile stretch of highway.
\
The Legislature's Transportation Committee is responsible for oversight of both agencies. Sen. Bill Diamond, D-Windham, a member of the committee, said he was in the Legislature in the 1980s when it considered a merger between the two entities.
\
""It warrants a closer look than has been done in the past,"" he said. ""I suspect it's going to make some people uneasy.""
\
Charles Colgan, a professor of public policy and management at the University of Southern Maine's Muskie School of Public Service, said the Legislature created the turnpike authority as a separate entity specifically to keep its debt separate from state debt.
\
""That has some advantages from the point of view of the bond holders,"" he said. ""They know their bonds are paid back first by toll revenues and there is little chance for political interference.""
\
Colgan said the Maine DOT and turnpike authority have a tradition of working together. By law, a high-level state DOT official is a member of the turnpike authority board.
\
In his view, the only compelling reason to merge the two would be if there are significant problems with coordination.
\
""I've never heard a reason to merge them compelling enough to overcome the reasons of keeping them separate,"" he said.
\
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
\
The looming budget crisis in the transportation department is fueled by many factors.
\
The federal government's share of transportation costs has dropped in recent years and is projected to continue to fall.
\
High oil prices drove up costs for basic construction material by 35 percent last year. Material costs could go up another 10 percent next year, according to the DOT.
\
When oil prices are high, which increases gas prices, people reduce their use of gas. That hurts the DOT because more than half of the state highway fund is supported by the gas tax.
\
And while the movement toward fuel-efficient vehicles is good for the environment, it's bad for the DOT because fewer gallons of gas are sold.
\
It's a national problem that's exacerbated by building booms in other countries, which forces the U.S. to compete for materials, DOT officials said.
\
In general, the mood at the state level is to reduce spending, not increase it.
\
And just two weeks ago, the state's top financial officer warned of revenues coming in below projections, a signal that more cuts could be coming to the state budget.
\
THE MAINE DOT
\
State transportation officials are quick to point out that while the department may have started as a state highway department, its current mission extends to buses, trains, ferries, airplanes and bike trails.
\
For most of the public, however, the DOT has come to represent roads and bridges.
\
The DOT budget is roughly $575 million a year, with nearly half coming from the state highway fund. The highway fund gets 70 percent of its money from the gas tax, which is 27.6 cents a gallon.
\
The DOT spends 61 percent of its annual budget on state highways and bridges, and an additional 25 percent on maintenance and operations, which includes plowing and patching.
\
Bruce Van Note, deputy commissioner of operations and budget, said the $2.2 billion estimated gap -- $220 million per year for the next 10 years -- will have to be addressed with a variety of measures.
\
""Obviously, there's going to have to be some kind of federal role, but there will have to be a state role, too,"" he said. ""This is a real current funding crisis now.""
\
The department already has taken steps to save $5 million to $10 million per year by cutting positions, reducing the number of trucks and through internal reorganizations.
\
""The magnitude of scale gets lost,"" he said. ""When you need $200 million and you're saving $5 million to $10 million, that's not going to get you there.""
\
Without money to make repairs, the department will have to put weight restrictions on bridges and roads, or close them completely, he said.
\
When it comes to bridges, the DOT has found 288 spans that are at risk of being closed, posted or speed-restricted within 10 years.
\
As it is now, the DOT replaces 14 bridges a year, but needs to replace more than double that number -- 32 -- to keep up with demand.
\
THE TURNPIKE AUTHORITY
\
Created by the Legislature in 1941, the turnpike authority is a separate government entity that can borrow its own money and raise its own revenue.
\
It gets no federal or state money.
\
The governor appoints, and the state Senate confirms, a seven-member turnpike authority board. For the last 18 years, Paul Violette, a former state lawmaker, has been in charge of the authority.
\
He likes to compare the authority to a business, stressing that it serves turnpike customers and looks to make a profit on projects such as service plazas where tired drivers can eat, use a restroom and get more gas.
\
Any money that is made on service plazas is used to maintain the turnpike, said spokesman Dan Paradee.
\
A new service area in West Gardiner, replacing those in Lewiston and Litchfield, is scheduled to open next fall and will feature a variety of fast-food vendors, a gas station and truck parking. service areas.
\
That will reduce the number of service areas from six to five.
\
The authority's annual budget is about $106 million, 80 percent of which comes from tolls. Of the remaining 20 percent, 16 percent is borrowed and 2.4 percent comes from concession rentals.
\
Unlike the state DOT, the authority borrows money using revenue bonds, which gives it the ability to borrow money against future revenues.
\
The authority, not the state, is obligated to pay back the loans using future toll revenues. The Legislature sets the maximum amount the authority can borrow, which is currently $486 million.
\
Violette and others in transportation described the authority's debt as ""off the books"" because it is separate from the bonds that voters approve for state DOT projects.
\
""What the turnpike authority provides the state is the means by which to generate capital to build and maintain unarguably the state's most important piece of transportation infrastructure, the Maine Turnpike,"" Violette said.
\
WHAT ABOUT A MERGER?
\
The three previous governors -- Joseph Brennan, John McKernan and Angus King -- have looked at the possibility of merging the two entities.
\
And while it seems like a good idea on the surface, there hasn't been evidence to show it would be an improvement to the system thus far, said Dana Connors, who headed the state transportation department from 1984 to 1994.
\
Connors said during his tenure, he too looked in many places for additional funding. He initially thought the turnpike authority would be the place to go, but eventually rejected the idea.
\
""I couldn't look anybody straight in the eye and say we'd improve coordination or planning,"" he said. ""I could not find the financial advantages.""
\
Connors, who now heads the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, said there's no harm in taking a look at it again.
\
Violette said if the state tried to take over the authority, it would have to immediately repay any outstanding loans, which currently stand at $385 million.
\
As it is now, the authority is by far more financially secure than the DOT because it can raise tolls when it needs additional money, Violette said. The last toll increase was in 2005 and another is scheduled for 2010.
\
If anything, the state may want to look at expanding the responsibility of the authority by giving it more parts of the state highway system to manage.
\
But that would mean more tolls for drivers.
\
""We are not a profit-making organization,"" said Paradee, the MTA spokesman. ""The money we make at the service areas is budgeted to be used to repair the highway and bridges.""
\
Violette said other states have now begun to charge tolls in response to many of the pressures facing Maine -- less federal money and higher costs to maintain roads and bridges.
\
From the DOT's perspective, all options are on the table, starting with a renewed emphasis on cutting administrative costs, said deputy commissioner Greg Nadeau. He said the governor has made it clear that everything from a merger on down should be considered.
\
""Specifically, he's asked us to look at any opportunities that might exist for administrative efficiencies and savings with respect to the Maine Turnpike Authority organization and the Maine DOT organization,"" he said.
\
Nadeau said he will spend the coming months looking at other states to see if there's a smarter way to run the system.
\
Baldacci has spearheaded other consolidation efforts, such as combining the state human services department with its mental health division into one agency. And despite early opposition to combining school districts to save money, a more modest version made its way through the Legislature.
\
Lawmakers also are considering the governor's idea to have the state take over county jails, another merger that sparked initial push back from many corners of the state.
\
Fuentes, of the better transportation organization, said a DOT/MTA merger would need to be considered carefully.
\
""Our concern would be is that the turnpike does a good job maintaining the system and the DOT doesn't,"" Fuentes said. ""They just don't have the funding to do it.""
\
Furthermore, her organization worries that combining a healthy organization with an unhealthy one isn't a good idea.
\
""I would hate to see the state do to the turnpike what they've done to the DOT,"" she said.

241,"
When Paul Violette stepped down as executive director of the Maine Turnpike Authority last Monday after 24 years in the post, he noted in his resignation letter that he served under four governors and 13 legislatures. A former House majority leader, Violette was rarely challenged.
\
But a critical report about him and the MTA released in January by OPEGA - the state's Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability -- has not only prompted Violette's resignation last week, but catalyzed a political wave that promises to change -- if not eliminate -- the MTA.
\
The 78-page report, while respectful of the MTA's authority and cautiously worded, first raised the question of $157,000 in gift certificates purchased by Violette in 2005 and 2006 and said to be given to organizations between 2005 and 2007 - spending for which Violette had no records, only a general recollection of what groups had benefited.
\
That troubled state Sen. Roger Katz, R-Augusta, co-chair of the OPEGA oversight committee. He vowed to issue subpoenas, if necessary, and said, after an initial investigation, that the MTA's account of gift card use was ""not completely accurate,"" and that the Attorney General's Office had been notified of the investigation. Two days ago, Katz's committee followed through on those vows, subpoenaing five gift card vendors and telling MTA staff to be prepared to testify before the committee.
\
The gift cards became the leading wedge in events that led to Violette's resignation, but the OPEGA report raised many other questions the Legislature and the MTA are just beginning to address.
\
Among them:
\
-- The way the turnpike shares money - or doesn't - with the Maine Department of Transportation;
\
-- The MTA's exclusive engineering contract with a national firm, HNTB, which totals $5.7 million, but has never been put out for bid;
\
-- The way the Legislature performs its oversight role.
\
The result of these inquiries is virtually certain to change the way the turnpike does business, and could even lead to the extinction of the MTA -- one of the oldest and most powerful of independent state agencies. It has issued $400 million in bonds, and has an annual budget of about $100 million.
\
Termination is the course Gov. Paul LePage clearly prefers. At a community forum in Westbrook last month, LePage called for merging MTA into MDOT and putting its functions under the direction of Transportation Commissioner David Bernhardt.
\
Since then, LePage has upped the ante. Last week, communications director Dan Demeritt said, ""He doesn't think there's a need to study the issue. He thinks we should merge it with DOT right now."" Demeritt also suggested it was time to revisit the turnpike's toll system, which spans the 109-mile roadway that now extends from Kittery to Augusta. ""Maybe we could keep the toll in York, but eliminate the rest of them,"" he said.
\
Most legislators are far more cautious about the turnpike's future status, but virtually all of them believe change is due, if not overdue, at the MTA.
\
Rep. Richard Cebra, R-Naples, House chair of the Transportation Committee, said change could begin with the way the MTA presents its budget to the Legislature. Though the state has long since moved to a July fiscal year, the MTA continues to budget by the calendar year.
\
""That means that the budget arrives in Augusta in September, when nobody's here,"" Cebra said. He doesn't think this allows adequate oversight.
\
Katz said that for him, a key issue is that the MTA ""is so insulated from public scrutiny."" He also believes that lawmakers will press the MTA to transfer larger amounts to DOT, which has fallen far short of its highway maintenance and reconstruction targets.
\
""Does it really benefit the state to have one Cadillac road, when the rest of the system is a Yugo?"" Katz asked.
\
In an interview the day after Violette resigned, Deputy Director Neil Libby, Treasurer Doug Davidson and spokesman Scott Tompkins defended the MTA's record and operations, while conceding that the OPEGA report had already put changes in motion.
\
""Maine is well served by the way the turnpike is run,"" Libby said. ""It's an efficient, low-cost operation that's responsive to public needs.""
\
MTA's income saved it from elimination
\
The Maine Turnpike Authority was created in 1941 to build a high-speed toll road from ""the vicinity of Kittery"" to ""the vicinity of Fort Kent."" Actual construction didn't begin until after World War II, with the first section, from York to Portland, completed in 1947 and an extension to Augusta opened in 1956. At that point, free interstate highways took over as the federal government assumed a new financial role in road building. States largely abandoned the original toll road model, and in Maine the interstate system ends in Houlton, much to the chagrin of northern Aroostook County.
\
The MTA is actually 30 years older than Maine's DOT, created from the old State Highway Commission when the Legislature authorized cabinet-style government in the early 1970s under Gov. Ken Curtis. Curtis consolidated more than 150 independent boards and commissions, but left the MTA on its own.
\
The Legislature has often been of two minds about the turnpike authority's independence. In 1963, lawmakers decided that tolls should be eliminated, along with the MTA, when the original construction bonds were paid off. But that direction began to waver during the administration of Gov. James Longley, an independent elected in 1974.
\
George Campbell was Maine's transportation commissioner from 1980-83, and now has the same job in New Hampshire. As he recalls it, ""Longley didn't want to raise the gas tax a penny, as the Legislature tried to do."" That's where the idea of raising turnpike tolls, and transferring revenue to the DOT, came from.
\
That compromise then led, under the Brennan administration, to the 1982 decision to keep the tolls and the MTA, while also requiring the turnpike to pay for Troop G, the State Police division that patrols the toll road.
\
At that point, the turnpike was transferring $4.7 million annually to the DOT, with the statutory amounts doubled and then redoubled, to $17.4 million. But during the 1990s, the requirement to transfer 25 percent of ""operating revenue"" was replaced by the entire ""operating surplus,"" which in practice has led to fast-diminishing cash transfers.
\
Since financing a $34 million bond in 1996 for MDOT, the turnpike has made no more transfers. The bond repayment costs $2.4 million annually, though Neil Libby points out that the MTA participates in joint projects with MDOT - including the new West Gardiner service plaza - that cost the MTA an additional $6 million a year.
\
For many lawmakers, that amount is not enough, and they want to reopen the debate about cost-sharing and oversight. Some want to go further - to revive the earlier concept of moving the MTA into MDOT, investigate leasing the road to a private operator, or even removing the tolls and increasing the gasoline and diesel taxes to compensate.
\
The differences start with what people think the Maine Turnpike Authority is.
\
""In terms of how it functions, it's really more like a private business than a public agency,"" said MTA spokesman Tompkins. That explains, in the MTA's view, its habit of donating to transportation groups like the Maine Better Transportation Association and seemingly unrelated nonprofits, including GrowSmart, Maine Audubon and Maine Preservation, where Violette served on the board.
\
The gift cards were the most controversial part of that program, and Gerard Conley Sr., longtime chair of the MTA, said the board wasn't aware of the donations. Tompkins said the staff was aware, though not of the details. ""Some of them Paul put on his credit card, others were authorizations for checks,"" he said Tuesday.
\
Overall, Deputy Director Libby said, the MTA is in business ""to provide a product to customers at a competitive price."" In his view, the MTA does not need to apologize for its independent status, and has accomplished its basic task of providing a well-maintained road at rates below the national average.
\
Such talk is a red flag for many legislators. ""It's a public agency, using public money for a public purpose,"" said Sen. Bill Diamond, D-Windham, a long-time member of the Transportation Committee and former co-chair of the Appropriations Committee. ""The sun should shine on the turnpike authority, and that should start now.""
\
N.H. does it differently
\
If the Legislature does decide the MTA shouldn't remain independent, it doesn't have far to go for a model. Neighboring New Hampshire has always located its turnpike authority within the DOT, although - as Libby points out - much of the agency structure, including an executive director, is common to both states.
\
""You wouldn't really save much money, because most of the positions would still have to be filled,"" he said. Other believes there could be significant savings. But money isn't the primary issue for most legislators - direction and control are more important to them.
\
New Hampshire commissioner Campbell once served on the MTA as the MDOT member, so he's familiar with both systems. In both states, toll revenues must be separated from other sources in an ""enterprise account."" But in other respects, life is very different for the New Hampshire toll road. For instance, last Friday, Campbell spent the afternoon in Concord in legislative hearings, trying to convince lawmakers that cutting the toll-collecting staff by half wasn't a good idea.
\
MTA officials are not called on to undertake such missions; the provision that the Legislature ""approve"" its budget is largely pro forma. Lawmakers can't make any changes, unlike in New Hampshire.
\
In terms of getting things done, Maine lawmakers point to New Hampshire's success in completing its open-road tolling facility at Hampton, which allows EZ Pass customers to drive through at highway speed. The MTA has been bogged down in a dispute with the town of York for more than two years in its attempt to implement open-road tolling. The reason, in large part, is ""the pure arrogance of the Maine Turnpike Authority,"" said Rep. Cebra. ""People dug in their heels"" after the MTA ""botched"" its public relation campaign, he added.
\
Potential legislative interference is a constant undertone in the OPEGA report, which made clear a concern that actions by lawmakers - rejecting toll increases, for instance - could undermine credit ratings.
\
Yet the two state turnpikes have almost identical credit ratings, with both maintaining about 100 miles of tolls roads. There have been no apparent ill effects from legislative budget review in New Hampshire.
\
Campbell said the New Hampshire system's ability to do unified planning has been an asset. He proposed legislation two years ago that would have ""aggregated"" all the interstates in New Hampshire - there are ""free miles"" on I-89, part of I-93 and Route 101 - to permit toll revenues to be used to maintain the entire system. Federal rules require such spending to be ""related"" to the actual toll road system, but in practice there's some flexibility.
\
The House approved the bill, but it was rejected in the Senate. This year Campbell is back with a ""consolidation"" proposal that essentially does the same thing.
\
Maine has a much larger proportion of ""free"" interstate roadway -- about 260 miles -- but some advocates for change say such a system could level the playing field, at least between roads such as I-295 north of Portland, which records the highest vehicle counts in the interstate system, and the turnpike. The MTA has proposed widening the turnpike through Portland, while DOT says it can't secure funding for a similar step on I-295.
\
Ending tolls would eliminate precious funding source
\
Another factor that could bear on the issue is the unwillingness of Congress to even consider a federal gas tax increase to fund a new six-year federal transportation bill. As now designed, the measure is about $100 billion short of its spending targets, and the federal highway fund has already been ""borrowing"" from the treasury with no sign that it will be able to pay back the loan.
\
At a recent gathering of state transportation commissioners, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood proclaimed, ""We like tolling.""
\
The message to Campbell was clear. ""He said it three times, very emphatically. If we're going to raise any new money soon, it's not going to come from the (federal) gas tax."" Such a policy could make states' toll-gathering ability, and the means to share the revenue, even more important in the years ahead.
\
New Hampshire hasn't raised its fuel taxes in 20 years. Maine has, but the inflation indexing used since 2005 is opposed by LePage, who's vowed to repeal it. He's included a $20 million transfer from the general fund to highways in fiscal 2013 to compensate.
\
The Maine Turnpike last raised its tolls in February 2009 -- the increase at the York toll station was from $1.75 to $2, for example -- and plans another increase in 2013-14, although the amount is not yet known.
\
Campbell said it's possible interstates that don't have tolls could get them. He's suggested that method to help fund a planned $800 million widening of I-93 from Salem to Manchester - but received a decidedly frosty reception from legislators.
\
In Maine, the Transportation Committee has discussed the possibility of ""tolling"" I-295 and I-95 from Augusta to Bangor, though there are few takers. For now, it appears more feasible to raise tolls where they now exist than extend them to new locations.
\
Highway engineering is another place where the MTA will get new scrutiny. National engineering firm HNTB has had the contract - including both design and construction supervision - since the very beginning, and it has been renewed annually for the last 70 years. MDOT has its own in-house engineering staff, but the MTA does not.
\
To Campbell, it makes sense to have in-house capabilities, even though New Hampshire does contract for about 70 percent of its design services: ""If you don't have your own staff to read the plans, how do you know how good they are?
\
Based on suggestions made by the OPEGA report, the MTA will begin soliciting bids for about a third of the $5.7 million in work now done by HNTB, starting next year.
\
Change in the wind
\
One framework for deciding the MTA's future is a bill filed by Sen. Douglas Thomas, R-Ripley, that would study privatizing the turnpike, turning it over to MDOT or creating stronger ties between the MTA and MDOT. The bill, LD 208, has not yet been scheduled for a public hearing before the Transportation Committee.
\
Leasing to a private operator seems to have the least support, initially. Deputy Director Libby says that the two states that sold 99-year leases to private operators, Illinois and Indiana, are not necessarily happy with the results. ""There's typically a big upfront payment"" -- $1.8 billion in the case of the Chicago Tollway -- ""but then the public loses all rate-setting authority for a hundred years."" Toll increases seem to be much larger and come quicker with a private operator, he said.
\
Asked for his own take, Thomas said he didn't necessarily support any of the options in his own bill. He said he'd be concerned that the lease payments might not support even the existing debt obligations of the MTA, ""and if they defaulted, then we'd be on the hook.""
\
As for merging with MDOT, he said, ""Sure, the governor wants it to happen so he has more control. But what's to say that the bad guys (at the MTA) won't be succeeded by other bad guys?""
\
If it were up to him, Thomas would remove the tolls altogether, as originally planned. ""That promise was made a long time ago, but it was still a promise."" He said he'd even ""consider"" an increase in fuel taxes to compensate, ""and you know all about my position on taxes."" Thomas has been a leading opponent of fuel tax increases during his tenure on the Transportation Committee, where he's served in both the House and Senate.
\
Thomas acknowledged that his is a ""minority opinion,"" and that does seem to be the case. Replacing toll revenue with other taxes isn't likely to be more popular with the Legislature in 2011 than it was in 1982, when the final decision to keep the tolls was made.
\
MTA Deputy Director Libby points out that while out-of-state vehicles account for 40 percent of turnpike traffic, they account for 60 percent of toll revenues, thanks to commuter and EZ Pass discounts available only to Mainers.
\
New Hampshire has a higher proportion of out-of-state use - more than half - and some states have even more.
\
""Delaware has about 90 percent out-of-state drivers on their section of I-95 (the Delaware Turnpike),"" Campbell said. ""They finance practically their entire transportation system that way.""
\
Gov. John McKernan, a Republican, proposed abolishing the MTA and merging it with MDOT, although he didn't strongly push the bill. Independent Angus King campaigned hard on the issue, only to do an about-face once in office, saying the state couldn't borrow as cheaply as the MTA. Other observers say this isn't necessarily so, citing the New Hampshire example, and say there could be some administrative savings in a merger.
\
Said Libby, ""Governors like the idea of a merger until they look at the details, and see that it's not so simple."" Yet today's political environment may prompt a different outcome.
\
Not only is the forced resignation of the MTA executive director coming at the outset of a new administration, but there's a renewed emphasis on accountability in government, and a new appreciation of the limits of existing funding.
\
Sen. Katz said the OPEGA committee's inquiries may be just the beginning. ""The first question we had to consider was whether the status quo was acceptable. And we've already answered that -- it's not.""

242,"
The state of Maine could not float a $50 million transportation bond this week because traders told officials there was ""no market"" at all for large financial transactions such as this one. The state hopes the national financial crisis will resolve itself by next week, when it again tries to access capital, likely at a higher interest rate than had been expected.
\
""In 34 years I have never had a trader say, ""I can't give you a sale price. There is no market,'"" Maine Municipal Bond Bank Executive Director Robert Lenna said, describing his efforts to sell the bond on Wall Street.
\
A week ago, Lenna said, he would have been able to get an interest rate for the AA-rated revenue bond in the ballpark of 3.8 or 3.9 percent. But the rates on Tuesday for that kind of bond were so high they effectively shut down market activity.
\
""If there is any place the (national financial) crisis is affecting the citizens of Maine, it is here,"" Maine Treasurer David Lemoine said Wednesday.
\
The board of directors for the Maine Municipal Bond Bank voted Wednesday to sit out this period of turmoil in financial markets, and try to sell the transportation bond sometime before Nov. 15 at a rate no higher than 5.5 percent. Even at that rate, the bond would cost taxpayers millions of dollars in extra interest payments over the life of the loan than might have been expected a week ago.
\
Lemoine said Thursday that the Bond Bank representatives made the right move by delaying.
\
""Congratulations on stepping back from the plate and having the courage to do that,"" he told Lenna at the Bond Bank's monthly board meeting on Wednesday.
\
There were no immediate repercussions of failing to sell the bond this week because the Department of Transportation did not need the funds immediately. However, there will be consequences if the market turmoil lingers, Lemoine said.
\
The $50 million TransCap bond is meant to pay for 10 highway reconstruction projects, involving over 20 miles of road in eight counties. It is part of a larger transportation package approved by the Legislature last session that includes $160 million in bonds earmarked for bridges.
\
Those bonds are scheduled to be put on the market in annual $40 million issues, from 2009 through 2012.
\
Lemoine said the jobs associated with the 10 transportation projects covered by the $50 million bond could be jeopardized if the markets don't recover. As a rule of thumb, about 34 jobs are created for every $1 million in transportation funds, meaning that up to 1,700 jobs could be affected.
\
""If this problem is not fixed, then you can look at the list of projects and the jobs that they would have created and say that is not going to happen,"" Lemoine said Thursday.
\
Lenna said the ""frozen, distorted"" bond market is particularly surprising since municipal bonds are considered very stable, with a default rate of less than 1 percent. But that perceived stability has been knocked out of kilter by the mortgage crisis.
\
""It's like this poison has been introduced into the financial circulatory system,"" he said.
\
""(The bond market) is where governments and towns and counties go to borrow the money that lets them build schools and build sewer plants and pave roads and do all of that infrastructure that needs constant maintenance,"" Lenna said. ""If this market were to contract substantially, if investors decide it is not as secure as they thought it was, or they thought there are other places to put their money, the impact on our ability to get money to build schools and hospitals and all of this stuff would be affected.
\
""It's a big deal. It's a really big deal,"" Lenna said.
\
In addition to refloating the TransCap bond, the Maine Municipal Bond Bank is looking to re-enter the market next week for its semi-annual bond sale, with a $99 million bond representing local projects for more than 20 municipalities. Lenna said he hopes the market will have settled down by then.
\
Maine's situation is not unique, according to Susan Gaffney, an executive with the Government Financial Officers Association, a trade association.
\
""We're hearing from many state and local entities that they are having problems with pricing and accessing the market,"" she said, noting that most are also choosing to delay activity until the market stabilizes. ""This is a problem with liquidity and not a problem with municipal securities as a product."" If anything, Maine is in a better position than most, since it has a limited number of bonds in play. Some major cities have daily activity in the market. ""You are in better shape to wait and let the market recalibrate,"" Gaffney said.
\
The TransCap bond sale delay will not hurt the 10 transportation projects, state transportation officials said. One of the projects, to repave a section of Route 4 in Sandy River Plantation, is already under construction, and a second project, to repair a section of Route 1 in downtown Kittery, has been put out to bid.
\
""Right now, we're fine. We're funding (the work) with money from elsewhere,"" said Mark Latti, spokesman for the Maine Department of Transportation. ""Now, if things continue and we're unable to sell the bond by the end of the year, it would pose some challenges. It would mean those projects would be delayed.""
\
Revenue to repay the TransCap bond will come from five sources, including 7.5 percent of annual receipts of the state gas tax, currently at 28.4 cents per gallon for gas and 29.6 cents per gallon of diesel. But gas consumption is down, eating into that revenue.
\
Other sources of TransCap revenue are $10 of each $25 vanity license plate fee and $10 of each $33 vehicle registration fee.
\
Latti said that various economic pressures have made it a difficult environment. Last month, Maine DOT announced it was suspending work on about 85 miles of road, a little more than 10 percent of the work planned for the year, because of rising asphalt prices.
\
""It's a difficult environment,"" Latti said. ""All state agencies are experiencing difficult times and it's a balancing act between available funding and available contractors. We're really in extraordinary times.""

243,"The recent French demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron's gasoline tax increase may have been the first such uprising, but it probably won't be the last -- in France or elsewhere.\Hundreds of thousands of French working-class demonstrators took to the streets of Paris and other parts of the country to protest Macron's 25-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase, with more increases to follow. The revenue would supposedly be used to fight climate change.\It's not like gasoline in France is cheap. The average price of gas is about $7 a gallon, according to The Associated Press, which adjusted for the European use of liters. That's $140 to fill up a 20-gallon tank. Ouch!\And that's in a country where the average income is about two-thirds that of America's.\Macron didn't care because he, like many progressives, wants to be seen as a leader in the fight against climate change, regardless of how much that legacy costs the working class.\But it turns out his French constituents do care -- a lot.\Macron was stunned by the size and determination of the spontaneous revolt. After insisting he wouldn't cave on the gas tax, he did, and he is now promising even more concessions.\France may be the most disruptive, but it isn't the first populist pushback.\Australia became the first country to repeal its tax on carbon emissions. That's where the government imposes a tax on each ton of carbon released into the atmosphere.\Even though it was considered model legislation, the Aussies didn't want it and the Senate repealed it in 2014 -- after only two years. Prime Minister Tony Abbott called the tax ""a useless destructive tax which damaged jobs, which hurt families' cost of living and which didn't actually help the environment.""\Sounds like the French demonstrators.\Closer to home, California raised the state's gasoline tax by 12 cents last year to 55.22 cents per gallon, the second-highest in the country.\Instead of rioting like the French, Californians forced a statewide tax-repeal vote last month. The effort failed, with 45 percent voting to repeal, but then gasoline isn't $7 a gallon in California -- yet.\But larger battles may be coming.\For example, socialist and Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., recently told an audience, it's ""inevitable that we can use the transition to 100 percent renewable energy as the vehicle to truly deliver and establish economic, social and racial justice in the United States of America. That is our proposal and that is what we are here to do.""\The federal government currently imposes its own tax on gasoline: 18.4 cents per gallon. Small croissants compared to France.\But the federal gasoline tax hasn't been raised in 25 years and has lost 64 percent of its purchasing power. Look for progressives to seek a significant increase in the near future.\In addition, members of Congress recently introduced a bipartisan tax on carbon emissions, like Australia's, that would force fossil fuel-producing companies to pay $15 for each ton of carbon their products emit. The tax would rise by $10 per ton every subsequent year.\Those two proposals would make driving a car or turning on the lights a lot more expensive, especially for lower- and fixed-income families.\Ironically, gasoline and carbon taxes are very regressive because everyone, regardless of income, pays the same price. Yet progressives support them anyway.\Imposing carbon and gasoline taxes is not about ways to pay for needed government services. It's about progressives, like Macron, trying to fund their climate change agenda.\The lesson from France is that working-class voters have a limit.

Add to that, all your car batteries will end up as pollution in a landfill in a few years.\I find it hard to believe, but not surprising that some of you are arrogant enough that you actually think that the public should pay to set up free fueling places for you. Why should we pay so you can ride around free? You already drive on roads that the rest of us pay a gas tax for, and you don't pay a dime. Why shouldn't you pay your share of road taxes?\Since Gov.-elect Janet Mills wants to tax everything, let's charge a yearly road tax for electric cars when they are registered every year based on the miles they are driven. And a disposal tax for dumping the car batteries when they need replacing.\No one will ever convince me that in Maine, with all the trees that need carbon dioxide to live, that the number of cars on our roads is causing any climate change.\Today's cars run cleaner than ever before and get better every year.

Later, 19th and early 20th century United States Fish Commission records show that thousands were caught in weirs and on flies in 15 or 20 towns around the Penobscot River and Penobscot Bay.\The issue here is what the effluent from a giant fish factory may do to the rest of the bay's ecosystem. The system used to support several thousand local people for much of the year - 500 small-boat fishermen taking cod and haddock, as well as over 220 weirs taking smelt, alewives, tomcod, cunner, herring and the occasional 500-pound tuna. Fish brought in from away (Asia, for instance) to feed the factory salmon may introduce a virgin soil epidemic into our ecosystem, and set the bay's recovery back another century.\When the bay was healthy, the proceeds of the fishery were distributed in every town on the water. Not a penny went to Norwegian stockholders. Read the U.S. Census for 1880 to see what the bay's ecosystems produced then - its value today would be in the order of $15 million to $16 million, even before the lobsters, clams, scallops, cod, haddock, halibut, tuna and other fish were counted.\These foreigners come in for one reason only: to make profits they can send home. They don't care what damage they may do to an ecosystem that thrived before they came. They could destroy the entire ecosystem and still send their profits back to Norway.\William Leavenworth \Searsmont\Aquaculture, environment can and will coexist\The Dec. 16 lead editorial, ""Our View: Aquaculture wrong target for protests,"" made a compelling case for new aquaculture projects.\Too often arguments around aquaculture are framed by a false dichotomy, whereby we are asked to choose between maintaining our pristine environment and economic development in industries beyond tourism. But new technological developments allow modern aquaculture, including land-based recirculating systems, to be both environmentally sustainable and economically viable.\In addition, economic development itself can fuel environmental progress, such as when increased tax revenues are invested in upgrades to wastewater treatment facilities and conversion to greener energy sources. With thoughtful planning and execution, Mainers don't need to choose between our environment and our economy.\James D. Herbert\president, University of New England\Biddeford\One liney herey two pls\Your Dec. 16 lead editorial, ""Our View: Aquaculture wrong target for protests,"" is misleading and inaccurate.\The editorial suggests that corporate aquaculture will ""contribute to a lower carbon profile than other methods"" in order to feed a hungry world, and it contains a link to the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit on Aquaculture that applies only to ""water environments, including ponds, rivers, lakes and the ocean."" However, the Nordic Aquafarms salmon farm proposed for Belfast would be land-based.\A peer-reviewed scientific paper published in Aquacultural Engineering in 2016, titled ""Comparative economic performance and carbon footprint of two farming models for producing Atlantic salmon,"" states that salmon produced on land has twice the carbon footprint of salmon produced in sea pens.\While 60 percent of Maine's electricity generation is considered renewable, a common misconception is that biomass derived from wood is low-carbon. In fact, a report released in 2017, ""The Great American Stand: U.S. Forests and the Climate Emergency,"" concludes that ""burning wood for electricity releases up to 50 percent more carbon dioxide than burning coal per unit of electricity generated.""\At a time when the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as well as the recent U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment urge that we do everything possible to lower our carbon footprint, I urge you to reconsider your support of the environmentally destructive Nordic Aquafarms industrial fish farm project.\George Aguiar\Lincolnville"
248,"The Portland Press Herald does a disservice to readers when it publishes errors of fact such as those printed in ""Another View: Let's do the climate math for answers on global warming"" (June 12). \According to the author, there are 12 currently active volcanoes worldwide, and a single volcano emits more ""carbon pollutants"" than ""all the cars ever built, combined."" \According to the U.S. Geological Survey, about 70 volcanoes are typically active in any given year, and they emit a total of only a small fraction of the carbon dioxide emitted by cars and light trucks annually. The best available complicated science on the role volcanoes play regarding climate is that volcanic emissions probably have a net cooling function, not warming, as the writer implied. \Inaccuracies regarding the science of global warming have been a regular feature of what appears to be an over-diligent effort on the part of the editors to offer a ""balance"" of opinions on global warming. \Inaccuracies aside, the more serious problem is that by choosing to publish so much material that rejects global warming science, the paper supports a ""false balance"" - that there are two relatively equal ""sides"" to the science of global warming. This is not accurate; the overwhelming weight of the best independent research indicates that global warming threatens our quality of life. \Good journalism is no accident. Guidelines for best practices challenge editors and contributors to fact-check, use the best sources with demonstrated expertise and qualifications in appropriate fields and to be ""fair to the truth"" - not create the impression that there are two equally valid ""sides"" to every issue. \Perhaps readers should be thankful that the editors haven't also felt compelled to give equal space to the Flat Earth Society each time the PPH prints an image of the Earth. \Dudley Greeley Cumberland \Like Florida, Maine can creatively tax tourists \Reps. Andrew McLean and Robert Nutting make a strong argument for better maintenance of our roads and infrastructure (""Maine Voices: Maine's statewide transportation infrastructure needs fixing,"" June 10). \No state will be attractive for business if its infrastructure is not maintained properly, and I agree with their assertion that bonding is not the appropriate way to raise money for regular maintenance; bonding should be reserved for improvements only. \Many years ago, I lived in Florida and was amazed at the creative ways the state taxed tourists so that it could reduce taxes for its own year-round citizens. \It was nice not paying state income tax in Florida, although this would never be possible in Maine. We have too few citizens maintaining the necessary programs and infrastructure - the penalty of living in a ""low-population/large-geography"" state. \I have a plethora of ideas on how to increase taxes on tourists, but let's just focus today on the gasoline tax. \Let's say the Maine state gas tax is 30 cents per gallon. Let's raise it to 35 cents from May through October and lower it to 25 cents from November through April. \A Maine citizen who buys gas relatively consistently will, on average, still pay 30 cents per gallon over the course of a year. However, all of the tourists who pile into Maine in the summer will pay 35 cents per gallon. With this scheme, the state would collect higher taxes to maintain our roads without increasing taxes on the average Maine citizen.  \And don't try to tell me that it will deter tourism! There's not a single tourist who bases their vacation plans on the gas tax rate. Florida taxes the bejesus out of people, and they still keep coming. \Andy Wright Cumberland Foreside \'War on drugs' approach to marijuana a disaster \Recently, in this paper, the group SAM Maine (Smart Approaches to Marijuana) invited us to strategize how to address the social justice issues inherent in the criminalization of marijuana (""Maine Voices: Legalization of marijuana is not a smart approach for Maine,"" June 7). We welcome the opportunity to talk with anyone about ways to reduce incarceration and ease our reliance on the criminal justice system. \The ""war on drugs"" approach has been a disaster, and the consequences have been harming our communities for decades. People are sent to jail for using marijuana, either directly or because of the inability to pay unwaivable fines. Those with offenses on their record have difficulty getting financial aid for school and face barriers to finding work. \Further, the criminalization of marijuana discriminates. In Maine, even though black people and white people use marijuana at similar rates, police are twice as likely to arrest a black person for possession. \Finally, the cost to taxpayers is enormous: In 2010, Maine spent nearly $9 million enforcing marijuana possession laws. That is $9 million that could be better spent elsewhere. \The war on drugs has had decades to prove itself; instead, it has done nothing but fill our criminal justice system with people who don't belong there. Criminal sanctions cannot be the solution to all of society's tough issues. It's time to end our culture of punishment. \Alison Beyea executive director, ACLU of Maine Portland \Cutler has ability, experience to solve Maine's problems \I believe in Eliot Cutler. I support Eliot Cutler because of his extraordinary ability, his integrity and his relentless work ethic. \The problems facing Maine include a weak economy, an aging population, a challenged public academic infrastructure and a lack of entrepreneurial incentive. \We need leaders who understand these problems and have the courage to propose and implement bold new solutions, leaders who are at home in any environment from schoolroom to boardroom to the Cabinet room. \We need leaders who not only understand Maine but also have the skills and experience and compassion to get us back in the game. We need leaders who have a steadfast belief in human rights. Leaders who are not bound to any party but are bound only to the needs of the people of Maine. We need leaders we can trust - trust with our pocketbook. \Eliot, and only Eliot, has those skills (proven over years of success all over the nation), and we the people of Maine will be the loser if we do not elect him. \Merle Nelson former Democratic state legislator Portland"
249,"There's an ongoing investigation regarding Russian collusion in Washington, D.C., right now. But if you're intrigued by government collusion, you need to look no further than our very own state: Bath, where a large employer and giant war-profiteering corporation basically own our state government. \It's not a right and title ownership; it's subtler than that. The lobbyists cozy up to the politicians, provide all the talking points, the outline or more of the desired legislation and the PR to back it up. The politician greases the skids, works the system and accepts the donations to stay in power for another cycle. It's not working, folks. \If you are wondering what I am talking about, check out the Maine Freedom of Access Act (thank you, First Amendment!) request for the emails between Bath state Rep. Jennifer DeChant and Bath Iron Works attorney Jon Fitzgerald. Bath Iron Works and its corporate overlord, General Dynamics, wrote the proposed $60 million tax break for themselves. You know, jobs, jobs, jobs (like those jobs should only exist to build death machines)! This, after having received many more hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks over the last two decades. \They need it to ""stay competitive"" - but why are we investing in a company and an idea that needs so many handouts just to stay in business? Bath Iron Works/General Dynamics aren't playing fair, and our politicians have no morality. We've got to untangle this web before it kills us. What's worst about it is just how commonplace it is, in every corner of the country - this is how business gets done. So rather than look overseas for the collusion that is killing our democracy and killing all of us, too, let's recognize it in our own backyards! \Dan Marks Portland \Arrogant utility company shouldn't be welcomed here \I suggest that if we want to know what's going on with Central Maine Power, we might ask CMP's owner, Iberdrola (in Spain), what's up and let them laugh at our naivete, as do other industries that buy rights to Maine soil and water from our local and state governments. \I wonder if Paul LePage had this plan in mind when he announced ""Open for Business"" on the ""Welcome to Maine"" signage in Kittery, or if corporations are the only citizens with a plan. \Alec Ferguson Kennebunkport \Unplug the proposed fee on hybrid and electric cars \Regarding the proposal that there be an annual fee of $150 on hybrid vehicles and $250 on electric vehicles: \We need to be more open to thinking about the future rather than clinging to the past. \I made the decision to get a used 2012 Prius based on concern for the environment as well as fuel efficiency. If I drive an average of 10,000 miles per year and average 48 miles per gallon, the difference between that and a fuel-efficient gasoline engine averaging 34 mpg would be 86 gallons per year. The tax of 30 cents per gallon would add up to $25.80 of lost revenue for the state in a year. \I would be willing to pay a fee of $30 per year, but not $150! Such an exorbitant cost would negate any savings and indeed cost me more than driving an efficient gasoline-powered car. \Not only that, but no one is going to want to purchase a used Prius when it comes time to sell. That's a double whammy. Electric vehicles use no gas, yet their owners might need to pay a gas tax equivalent for miles traveled figured on some imagined gasoline usage. Really, how much is this going to help fund our roads? \Instead, let's look at other ideas. I know there is little appetite for raising the gas tax, but at some point this will need to happen. There's also the wear and tear that heavier vehicles place on our roads. Perhaps adding a fee for vehicle weight would be more fair. \These are just a couple of suggestions that I know are being considered. Let's get creative and come up with ways to fund our roads without penalizing cars that will be the way of the future - but not in Maine if there is an additional excise fee. This is going backward, not forward. \Margaret Harrison Hollis \Regulations needlessly add to expense of child care \Costs are high because Maine day cares are being forced to close. \I've been doing child care in my local community for 27 years, and I almost closed last year because of excessive regulations that are costly and do not increase safety of children. I know many qualified licensed professional family child cares that raised their prices and many that just closed. It's easy to say that more regulations make children more safe, but when parents can't endure the increased costs of care or can't find any openings, are children really more safe? \When child care is unaffordable or less available, children end up in illegal child care that does not have even basic safety or fire inspections. \It is easy to say that child care needs to be higher quality, have newer furniture and be accredited, but does it really make a difference? Every parent and child who I have met seem to value personal interaction, play and exploration, reliability of care and affordability. \Lawmakers have a chance to preserve what is left of Maine's child care industry by realizing that strict regulation and accreditation do not keep children safe. They just cause the costs to go up and good places to close. Licensed child care professionals do keep children safe; without them, the desperate parents will be forced to choose less-safe options for their children. \Kathy Folan South Portland \A low minimum wage proves high in social costs \I am concerned about the current proposal in the Maine Legislature to modify the ballot initiative approved by Maine voters in 2016 to increase the minimum wage in our state from a mere $7.50 an hour to $9 and, eventually, in 2020, to $12 an hour. \Having worked in New York's criminal justice system for over 35 years, I have seen firsthand the difficult struggles of the poor who try to subsist and raise children on a minimum wage. The cycle of poverty continues as people try hard but lack the means to support their families. \Why is there an attempt among some of our lawmakers to subvert the voters' decision? Since 2016 more than 159,000 workers saw a pay increase for the first time in eight years. Although some businesses express concern, the higher employment figures which have resulted have been good for Maine's growing economy. \Let's encourage our state senators and representatives to continue to honor our vote and to continue to improve the economy of our state and the quality of life for its people. \Judy Johnson Scarborough"
250,"Shame - it's a feeling most of us have experienced at some point in our lives. We felt alone, unworthy, and full of self-doubt. We usually remember those isolated times because they impacted us so deeply.\For people with active substance use disorder, shame is not a one-time feeling they are able to escape from. In a society that forces those in active addiction into the shadows, shame is a constant companion, a constant feeling of inadequacy, and a constant sense of incompetence. Drugs are a way to try to escape and hide from the naked exposure shame induces. Feeling undeserving of help, shame becomes a barrier to self-help, and keeps people in the cycle of addiction, with shame feeding the disease.\Healing from shame calls for a radical approach. It requires a safe, accepting environment where one can build trust, allow vulnerability, and feel worthy of getting treatment. Providing overdose prevention sites (OPS) is one answer to shame and this desperate disease. The only reason they have not existed in the United States is because of the shame, stigma, and discrimination our culture brands people with, who have the disease of substance use disorder.\While the politicians in Augusta have their ""hands tied"" to legalize OPS statewide, we can create a pilot site in one of our hardest hit areas - be it in Portland, Bangor, Lewiston, or in rural Aroostook County. With a little effort, a few supplies, and donated funds, one town or city can be the first small step to stop the dying in Maine.\Meanwhile, let us all look ourselves in the mirror and see how we contribute to shame every day, in every action and thought we have about people, humans like us, who suffer from this terrible disease.\Elaine Shamos\Portland\Poor women deserve the right to choose
\Last week I attended a committee hearing on L.D. 820, insurance nondiscrimination for pregnant women, and opposition points of view were unfathomable to me.\Opponents didn't want to pay for this ""elective"" procedure, abortion. Elective should mean caused by one's actions - most pregnancies; much lung cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Should I pay for these? Yes, I am a member of a society; I have a responsibility to other members.\They don't want government telling them what to do. But they have no problem forcing poor women into having children they can't afford - often causing women and children into a life of deprivation.\Someone stated those potential children could become scientists, engineers, etc. Some children from challenging backgrounds become great contributors, most do not.\Never mentioned is what the woman could have become, if her ambitions had not been truncated. A lot about dignity, liberty, pursuit of happiness, but never for her.\Their tax dollars could be better spent?\Abortion is a single procedure. Pregnancy care is not, then child medical care, WIC, supplemented rent and school lunches. From a purely dollar standpoint, their logic doesn't work!\Freedom of religion, but only for them! We fight the ISIS caliphate.\Yet they would coerce us all into living by their religious beliefs. Different in degree, but same principle. Separation of church and state?\This one really got me! Their solution to Maine deaths surpassing births - force women who can't pay for care they need to give birth to children they can't afford.\If a love of children is their real motive, why doesn't their effort go to fighting for better education, paid family leave, subsidized child care, a livable wage, and a livable planet?\How many underprivileged children have they adopted or fostered?\Kathleen Conrad\North Yarmouth\Homeless people are people first
\In response to Anne Pringle's ""Homelessness raises undiscussed policy questions in Portland"" (Feb. 2 Maine Voices), I would like to point out the lack of the use of the word ""people"" and the use of the term ""homeless"" instead. These are people. People who have numerous reasons for being homeless. People who have many barriers to being housed independently. People who will die if they are not cared for. If there were a simple solution to this complex issue, the discussions would be over.\The animal shelter contracts with other towns that share the cost. Unfortunately, other towns have not been willing to pay even meager amounts to shelter their citizens. The operating costs are likely significant but again, these are vulnerable people in need of shelter.\Forced treatment and assessment at social service agencies doesn't work. People have to want to change and for very many reasons, this is difficult to almost impossible for many of the people who access the shelters. We must not abandon those who overwhelmingly have experienced significant trauma throughout their lives.\Not In My Back Yard (NIMBY) ideas and attitudes are not helpful. What's next? ""Build a wall around Portland?"" ""Make Portland Better Again?"" Perhaps Mr. Strimling should say ""our people"" vs. ""our homeless"", but my question to you, Anne Pringle, is ""How many nights are you willing to work the door at the shelter in January and turn people away who are not from Portland or don't meet your qualifications to spend the night inside?""\Lorrie Ferrari\Portland\Groups that work with children should have abuse prevention policies\April is child abuse prevention month, and we have to have a difficult conversation.\Sexual abuse is extremely awkward to talk about, but we owe it the our children to make sure we are having these conversations that preserve their one childhood. One thing we can do today, is to get to know the values and safety practices of the people who are caring for your children; on playdates, sleepovers, at camps, sports activities, religious gatherings, school, caregivers, dance studios, gymnastics gyms, and more.\Ninety percent of child sexual assault is committed by people children know, love and trust. The people closest to us. Thirty to fifty percent to of these acts are committed by youth.\Many of the organizations that have been involved in the abuse of a child are not held accountable, nor do they change their actions. Many times, assaults go unreported.\According to Feather Berkower, Founder of Parenting Safe Children, there are ways we can protect our children and set expectations of those that come into contact with them. We can educate our children, but ultimately it is up to us to protect them.\Today, please start asking every organization involved in your child's care if they have a written sexual assault policy. It is uncomfortable, but we have to. Maine's legislation and sexual response community needs to step up its preventative measures. We need to learn the red flags and grooming signs and educate before the abuse occurs. Local law enforcement agencies want us to be proactive and involved in keeping kids safe.\Mindfulness is a hot word, but it can effectively address many issues before they turn tragic.\Betsy Haskell\Topsham\Bad roads worse for tourism than gas tax hike
\How depressing to read about the Tourism Lobby's opposition to increasing the gas tax, again! They seem convinced that any increases in the cost of tourism will turn our visitors away.\I have never talked to any tourist who calculated the taxes and fees before traveling to a destination and changed course because it would've cost them 2 percent more than going someplace else.\I think a bigger negative is having our visitors drive on washboard roads. They may be more likely to choose another destination after paying for the wear and tear on their cars!! Let them help pay for a safe and comfortable ride and come back for more!\Craig Stirling\Gorham \"

I recently read a letter in the Sun Journal about gas prices. In the letter, the writer suggested what people could and should do to help the environment. He also suggested how people should use the money from the gas tax.
\
I must say that I completely agree with the letter writer. People should be doing everything that we can in order to keep the Earth from burning up and becoming a wasteland like Mars. As stated in the documentary ""The Eleventh Hour,"" it will be the Earth that survives. It won't be people. The Earth might become incapable of supporting life, but it will survive.
\
People should start acting more efficiently toward the environment. People should wash their cars to keep dirt off, reducing drag and increasing mileage, and they should make sure that the tire pressure of their cars is at the right level. And they can keep their cars tuned up. People should also buy and drive more efficient cars.
\
I am only in the eighth grade, but when I can drive, I am going to make sure that my car is efficient.Sean Deans

253,"
PORTLAND - Two Maine environmental groups unveiled a report Tuesday that suggests 20 ways that state government can cut gasoline costs and reduce global warming pollution.
\
Released by the Natural Resources Council of Maine and Environment Maine, the report offers a range of recommendations, including several that could hit consumers in the wallet.
\
One goal of the proposed policies is to make individuals pay the full costs of driving - costs, the groups say, that are today subsidized or passed on to others in the form of pollution and congestion. Another is to take into account global warming pollution when thinking about transportation.
\
Among the ideas is to place stricter controls on new development and growth, provide incentives for more fuel-efficient vehicles, increase the cost of parking, require high-mileage tires and calculate auto insurance rates by the number of miles driven, which would act like a higher gas tax and discourage people from driving.
\
""The recent surge in gas prices underscores that we have an unsustainable transportation system,"" said Jennifer Andersen of the Natural Resources Council of Maine. ""We can't afford the price at the pump, and we can't afford the price on the planet.""
\
She called the region's transportation system unsustainable.
\
Positioned strategically alongside a covered bus stop on Congress Street in Portland, speakers used the passing buses as a moving backdrop to make their case for more transportation alternatives.
\
""Now we're siphoning off General Fund money to deal with highway maintenance,"" said Matthew Davis, an advocate with Environment Maine. ""If we had a sustainable system such that gas taxes paid for highways in full, people would be paying the true cost of driving.""
\
According to the report, ""Shifting Gears: 20 Tools for Reducing Global Warming Pollution from New England's Transportation System,"" the transportation sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gas pollution in the state. In 2001, it produced almost 72 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, more than all the homes, businesses and industrial facilities combined. Most of that pollution comes from gasoline burned in cars, trucks and SUVs.
\
Joining in the release of the report was Peter Cavanaugh, the operations director for the Greater Portland Transit District or METRO, and Carey Kish, manager of GoMaine Commuter Connections.
\
The speakers called on increased support for mass transit, including rail and bus lines, as well as the use of new technologies to reduce pollution and smart-growth policies that fight sprawl.
\
METRO has put into service 13 new compressed natural gas buses that will reduce emissions compared to diesel and the system has opened its first compressed natural gas fueling station, which is open to anyone, Cavanaugh said.
\
GoMaine, which coordinates car pools and van pools around the state, has seen a 23 percent increase in people registered with its ride-share program in the past six months, Kish said. And $400,000 has been committed to the program to double the size of the state's van-pool program.
\
""Car pooling helps commuters fill in where there is no transit service,"" Kish said. ""It gives commuters an immediate 50 percent reduction in their commuting costs, just by riding with one person.""
\
The report envisions a world less dependent on individual automobiles, with communities more interconnected and with more opportunities for walking and bicycling.
\
""We are seeing the effects of global warming already,"" Davis said. ""We need to make sure we're making the smart decisions about the way we grow and the way we move people and goods in this state so that we're not contributing anymore than we already are to global warming and air pollution problems.""

254,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved a $214 billion bill Thursday to upgrade the nation's highways and mass transit systems and bring tens of thousands of jobs to communities across the country.\If the Senate and President Clinton agree to the same terms, the legislation would mean an additional $47.2 million per year for Maine.\The giant bill also would crack down on drunken driving and preserve a program helping women and minorities win government construction contracts.\It took two weeks for the Senate to hammer out the final version of the 800-page bill, as lawmakers made sure their states got a fair share of the huge pot and fought for money for covered bridges, ferries and levitated trains.\""It really gives a major boost not only to jobs, not only to the environment, but really for quality life across the board,"" said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a chief architect of the legislation. ""This was a mountain to climb, and we're at the top.""\The bill passed 96-4, sending it to the House for consideration. Congress must get the completed bill to President Clinton before May 1, when the current short-term highway spending law expires.\In the gallery for the final vote was Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who praised the Senate for doing a ""great job.""\The legislation carves out $173 billion for highway construction and safety programs through 2003, up 38 percent from the six-year plan that ended last fall. Mass transit would get $41.3 billion, a 31 percent boost.\Supporters said the bill could have a major impact on the economy, citing figures that every $1 billion in transportation spending creates 42,000 jobs.\Reflecting both the prospect of budget surpluses and pressures to do something about the nation's crumbling infrastructure, the final bill was considerably more generous than legislation coming out of Senate committees last fall, with $26 billion more for highways and an additional $5 billion for mass transit.\The new money in part will come from a decision that 4.3 cents of the federal gas tax previously reserved for reducing the budget deficit would go exclusively to transportation needs. Supporters insisted they could stay within budget caps by cutting other programs, although no one was specifying where those cuts would be made.\The bill would increase highway funding for Maine by $47.2 million per year, to $144 million per year over the next six years, Sen. Olympia Snowe said.\""This legislation puts Maine on the right track for the next six years by increasing vital road funding and supporting a full spectrum of transportation investments,"" Snowe said.\Sen. Susan Collins added: ""Maine's future prosperity depends on maintaining its roads and bridges and making sure our transportation system is ready to support the economic opportunities of the 21st century.\""I'm encouraged at how many ways this bill can help the state of Maine meet those goals,"" Collins said.\The stage was set for a final vote Wednesday when Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, agreed to come up with more money for seven states whose senators felt they lost out under new formulas for distributing highway funds.\The Senate earlier agreed that each state should get back at least 91 percent of the money it pays into the federal highway trust fund. In the past some states have received as little as 70 cents for every dollar paid -- and some states said the final agreement still left them short of that target.\""It is a long road, still, toward fairness -- from our perspective, I emphasize -- but this represents a step along the road,"" Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said of the deal, which would give his state an additional $11 million a year.\Earlier this week, the Senate Banking Committee chairman, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., also managed to remove lingering opposition to the mass transit part of the bill. He agreed to funnel more money for rail modernization to fast-growing cities, many in the West and South, that have only recently turned to mass transit as a means of relieving traffic congestion. He also doubled, to $500 million, new money going to communities with populations under 50,000.\Beyond the money aspects of the bill, the Senate accepted amendments that push states to enact 0.08 percent blood-alcohol-content levels for drunken driving and ban driving with open containers of alcohol. States that don't go along may face a loss of future highway money. Fifteen states, including Maine, already impose the 0.08 percent limit."
255,"Good morning from Augusta. Cities and towns are still reporting election results to the Bangor Daily News at this hour after Tuesday's election. View them here on a town-by-town basis.\QUOTE OF THE DAY: ""When you come in late to the game and you are someone who has a record, you can't assume you can just wash that away with spending,"" Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist, told the Associated Press on Michael Bloomberg's disappointing showing on Super Tuesday. The former New York City mayor will reportedly reassess his campaign today after not winning a single state Tuesday. Here's your soundtrack.\What we're watching today\Nationalization beat organization in Maine's Democratic presidential primary. Before Election Day, you could have made the case that former Vice President Joe Biden had put in the least amount of work in Maine of all the Democrats running for president. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren organized here for months. Even Andrew Yang gave the Bangor Daily News an interview in New Hampshire once.\Yet it is Biden who won the Maine primary in an upset. With 86 percent of precincts reporting, the former vice president leads Sanders by just over 2,000 votes. If the end result is that close, Biden and Sanders will take away similar numbers of delegates, with the exact totals depending on the final breakdown in each congressional district. Warren, who is currently sitting at 15.8 percent of the vote, will likely take away a few delegates, too.\But the result is a significant victory for Biden, who likely benefited from the last-minute dropouts of former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, who was polling well in Maine, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. The former vice president won at least nine other states on Tuesday, compared with only three for Sanders.\The environment that the primary created was just too much for conservative causes on the ballot. A people's veto effort to repeal a stricter vaccine law failed decisively, with 73 percent of voters opposed with 86 percent of precincts reporting. The law, which will eliminate religious and philosophical exemptions for mandatory school vaccinations, passed by just one vote in the state Senate last year, largely along party lines, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed.\That party split likely helped opponents of the referendum on Tuesday, when Democratic turnout was expected to exceed Republicans due to the competitive presidential primary, though the decisive margin suggests partisan differences might not fully account for the ultimate result. The law will now go into effect in September 2021.\The skewed electorate also played out in a special legislative election in Brewer, where City Councilor Kevin O'Connell, a Democrat, handily defeated former Rep. Garrel Craig, a Republican, by 16 points in a swing district that will be in play again in November.\The Maine politics top 3\-- ""Maine panel recommends hiking road funding, but punts on long-term shortfall fix,"" Caitlin Andrews, Bangor Daily News: ""The blue-ribbon commission decided on Tuesday to suggest the Legislature consider any funding solutions be built on a 50 to 60 percent increase in general fund revenue and the rest from new revenues, which could include measures like a gas tax increase or higher fees for electric vehicles. It recommends the increase be built up to over the next three to four years. The decision means lawmakers avoid a tricky decision of deciding how the problem will be fixed for now.""\-- ""Judge orders Portland to allow Maine GOP to collect signatures for people's veto push,"" Michael Shepherd, BDN: ""In an emergency order on Tuesday, a judge ordered Portland to allow the Maine Republican Party to gather signatures at polling places for a people's veto effort to repeal ranked-choice voting in presidential races.""\-- ""Party lines emerge in Legislature over $127 million spending proposal,"" Scott Thistle, Portland Press Herald: ""Republicans on the human services committee had voted against most of the spending proposals in a near-unified block Monday. That stance is likely to foreshadow where minority Republicans will line up as votes on the spending package, proposed by Democratic Gov. Janet Mills in February, are cast in the days ahead.""\Otherwise, it seems like smooth sailing for the governor's spending package so far. Report-backs from committees on environment and natural resources, inland fisheries and wildlife, taxation and transportation all show unanimous or-near unanimous votes on the proposals related to their committee. Reports from the judicial, labor and housing and state and local government committees are expected by the end of Wednesday.\Today's Daily Brief was written by Michael Shepherd, Jessica Piper and Caitlin Andrews.

256,"AUGUSTA, Maine -- The six candidates who aspire to be Maine's next U.S. senator have spent months laying out plans for what they would do if elected. But they can expect to arrive at a place where doing nothing has become the norm and where balancing the interests of the state and nation has become increasingly difficult.\Democrat Cynthia Dill, Republican Charlie Summers and independents Angus King, Danny Dalton, Andrew Ian Dodge and Steve Woods are competing to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe.\Maine's next senator needs to ""find common ground and keep the best interests of the people of Maine -- and all Americans -- in the forefront,"" former Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, said Wednesday. He was echoed by Snowe, who said, ""The country has been placed on hold on so many issues that contribute to whether or not we can change the course on jobs, the debt, the deficit and the quality of life so many Americans cherish.""\Budget and economy\Although ""pork"" has become a dirty word, states rely heavily on federal funding and the Senate plays a huge role in how that money is allocated.\Maine receives more money from the U.S. government than it pays into federal coffers. In August 2011, the Economist reported that between 1990 and 2009, federal spending in Maine outpaced its federal tax payments by $75.6 billion. The magazine places Maine behind only six states as the greatest recipient of federal largesse.\A Tax Foundation calculation based on 2005 numbers ranks Maine 13th -- receiving $1.41 back for every dollar paid to the feds -- in terms of return on payments to the federal government.\A new senator might find good reason to continue that flow of cash.\""If you invest federal dollars in early childhood, you help reduce the cost of K-12 education, of welfare, incarceration and crime because you have created a healthier, more self-sufficient individual,"" said Laurie LaChance, president of Thomas College in Waterville and former state economist.\But immediate concerns about the debt and federal spending might preclude that type of investment.\""The biggest issues we will face are fiscal issues,"" Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said Wednesday in a phone interview. ""We have a $16 trillion debt that's unsustainable. We have needs in everything,"" from a crumbling infrastructure to security against terrorism including cyberattacks.\""We will need to revitalize our economy in a way that doesn't worsen our debt,"" Collins added. ""It's been three years since the Senate passed a budget, and that's outrageous. We need to stop kicking the can down the road on issues that are so important to our families and our country's prosperity.""\As a matter of economic security, Snowe says Maine's new senator must contribute immediately to consensus-building that will break Congress' political and procedural status quo, which inhibits businesses from planning for the future with any sense of security.\Scott Moody, president of the conservative Maine Heritage Policy Center, agreed.\""The country cannot afford this unsustainable accumulation of debt because it is fueling another time bomb, which is the interest payments,"" Moody wrote in an email.\But any talk of trimming either Social Security or Medicare to balance the budget or reduce debt upsets a large segment of the state's population.\With a median age of 42.7 and 16.3 percent of its population age 65 or older, Maine has a rapidly aging population that's comparatively more dependent on social programs. A third of Mainers older than 65 rely solely on Social Security as their income source, according to Lori Parham, Maine state director for AARP. The average annual benefit for Mainers receiving Social Security is $13,100, according to the AARP Public Policy Institute.\Transportation\The tension between taking action to reduce the national debt and ensuring that Maine's most pressing transportation infrastructure needs are met will pose another challenge. All states receive more for transportation than they pay into federal coffers. An October 2012 Center for American Progress report notes that Maine received $1.46 in Federal Highway Administration funding for every $1 the state paid into the Highway Trust Fund in 2008, adjusted for the two-year lag in payment.\David Cole, who served as the state's transportation commissioner from 2003 until 2011, noted the new senator soon will be ""in the middle of a major debate on what will hopefully be a longer-term highway reauthorization bill to address the country's aging infrastructure and economic competitiveness."" The recently enacted federal transportation bill, MAP-21, runs out at the end of September 2014. The estimated allocation of Federal Highway Administration funds under MAP-21 to Maine for fiscal year 2012 is $178.8 million, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\But the ground rules will be different.\""For many years the federal Highway Trust Fund was a healthy and reliable source of funds to build our nation's highways, bridges and transit systems, but the gas tax that supports it is no longer a sustainable model due to more fuel-efficient vehicles coming on line,"" Cole said.\To highlight Maine's situation, Cole cited ""Connecting Maine,"" a long-range transportation plan completed in 2010 that identifies about $3 billion in unmet need based on historic funding levels.\""We were very fortunate to have Sen. Snowe on the Senate Finance Committee, which is obviously a key position,"" said Maria Fuentes, executive director of the Maine Better Transportation Association. ""We are also fortunate to have Sen. Collins on the Appropriations Committee, where already she has proven her mettle by getting the truck weights legislation passed in Senate. ... It will be difficult for a new senator to have the clout of someone like Sen. Snowe since she was there for so long, but without people in key positions, Maine will be at a big disadvantage.""\Energy and environment\The nation's energy policy has prompted significant debate in this year's U.S. Senate campaigns, but opinions in Maine differ on where those policies should focus.\""What America and Maine thrive on is abundant and affordable energy,"" said Jamie Py of the Maine Energy Marketers Association. ""We need to seriously enhance North American supply of oil, gas and other sources of energy, especially if we have an abundance of oil, gas and coal. We can look at renewables, but in the short term we need to ensure we have an adequate supply.""\Beth Nagusky, Maine director of Environment Northeast, argues that federal energy policy must acknowledge and account for climate change.\""The ski industry, maple syrup, forestry, fishing and farming all stand to be impacted,"" she said. ""It would be a disservice to the state if Maine's next senator did not take on global warming.""\""Energy has long been a disadvantage to Maine,"" said LaChance. ""Greater federal support for conservation and independence could help minimize the disadvantage Maine has on energy. It would foster business growth and add security to families.""\Education\Much of the communication about state and national education reform initiatives takes place between the Maine Department of Education and federal officials. However, with Maine's fiscal year 2012 allocation of federal funds for elementary and secondary student programs estimated at more than $147 million, the stakes make it imperative that Maine's next senator be a strong advocate for Maine schools, educators say.\Action on the federal level sets the stage for what happens in the state, LaChance said.\""We have to focus on regaining the national and state dominance in education,"" she said. ""The way the world economy is evolving requires ever-increasing levels of education if we are going to compete. Education across the entire spectrum of life is the most important thing we can do.""\The latest report on Maine schools' compliance with federal No Child Left Behind standards, released this week, shows that only 35 percent of Maine schools met the federal targets. That adds importance to the Maine Department of Education's effort to gain flexibility from those standards with a waiver request submitted in September.\""I believe that the next senator from Maine needs to understand the importance of local control of education in Maine,"" said Connie Brown, superintendent of the Augusta School Department. She also would like to see Maine's next senator ensure the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, also known as No Child Left Behind, become more flexible with testing.\""The current obsession with standardized testing needs to be tempered with allowing children to be curious, to explore and to take their time to learn,"" Brown said.\What to expect\Collins said committee assignments will be important for her new colleague because that's where much of the Senate's work takes place. Collins and Snowe agreed that continuing the close collaboration on committee assignments they have enjoyed during the past 14 years will be essential.\""The Senate is a small place,"" Collins said. ""Having good relations with people on both sides of the aisle makes you a good senator.""\Asked to offer a single piece of wisdom acquired during their years in the Senate, Collins and Snowe echoed Mitchell's advice to ""find common ground and keep the best interests of the people of Maine -- and all Americans -- in the forefront.""\""It's a time in America that requires urgent action and tangible solutions,"" Snowe said, reiterating that the first step toward those tangible solutions will be to break through the ""polarization and partisanship"" that reflect the ""strong divisions within the institution"" of the Senate.\When asked Wednesday to compare that challenge to attaining peace in Northern Ireland, former Sen. Mitchell smiled, shook his head and walked away.\Credit: Robert Long BDN Staff"
257,"sidebar Governor\ What is the most important thing Maine should do to strengthen its economy?\ DAVID EMERY: Maine must control its spending, cut taxes so that we are no longer the most heavily taxed state in the nation, ease the negative impact of anti-business regulations, and begin to pay down our $5 billion long-term debt.\ PETER MILLS: First, run the government itself like a business, to earn the respect and confidence of private investors and Maine voters as well. Secondly, invest more public dollars in the Maine Technology Institute, in biotechnology and in other high-tech research-and-development initiatives that are most promising for growth.\ CHANDLER WOODCOCK: We need to reduce the income tax and lower the cost of health insurance.\ Do you support the ""taxpayer bill of rights"" spending cap that will be on the ballot Nov. 7?\ EMERY: Yes.\ MILLS: The most important part of TABOR, that half of the bill that purports to constrain state government, is unconstitutional and ineffective; while the remaining half attempts to repeal the New England town meeting. I favor a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds legislative voting restriction on taxes and spending, but TABOR fails to deliver it.\ WOODCOCK: Yes.\ Can the state do anything to control gas prices or cut consumption?\ EMERY: Maine must aggressively promote the development of renewable energy. We can reduce dependence on oil by producing biodiesel and other biofuels, by manufacturing ethanol from wood and agriculture, and by generating electricity from wind and water. I also favor development of an LNG facility in eastern Maine.\ MILLS: Gas prices are set by markets and not by state government. Consumption can be constrained by promoting conservation for example, through tax credits or other incentives for hyperefficient buildings and economical cars and appliances.\ WOODCOCK: State and federal taxes account for nearly 50 cents per gallon of gasoline in Maine. We should take our gas tax, which is increased automatically for inflation, off auto-pilot. Consumption is a matter of choice, but we can help educate people and provide incentives to help reduce our dependency on foreign oil.\ How should the state best protect its natural resources?\ EMERY: Maine should continue its tradition of balanced use of our natural resources. Wood from our forests, electricity generated by our rivers, our groundwater, and the fishery resources from our coastal waters are important to our economy and can be perpetually renewable if managed wisely.\ MILLS: Sensible, but not burdensome, controls over land use; moderate and persistent funding of the Land for Maine's Future Program; and incentives to encourage private land owners to preserve current uses for their land, for example, through the tree-growth, open-space, and working-waterfront programs.\ WOODCOCK: Maine people treasure our natural environment. Taking our natural environment for granted is dangerous. The state should insist that negative environmental impacts are internalized by those causing them.\ Should the state change its online sex-offender registry to better protect the people who are listed there?\ EMERY: No. All citizens, especially parents, have a right to know about sex criminals and predators living in their communities.\ MILLS: Protecting Maine children and families is my first concern. If criminal-justice professionals recommend changing registry requirements to reflect the seriousness of an offender's convictions, I would respect their recommendations.\ WOODCOCK: No.\ Should the state broaden the sales tax and use the additional revenue to lower other taxes?\ EMERY: Maine has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. I would want to assure that any change in the tax structure would be revenue-neutral and not merely become a source of more revenue for additional state spending.\ MILLS: I prefer to control spending first, to determine whether we might lower property and income taxes by that means before expanding other taxes.\ WOODCOCK: No.\ Would you keep or eliminate the Dirigo Choice insurance program?\ EMERY: Maine consumers could save several hundred dollars per month if Dirigo Choice were replaced with a market-based health- insurance strategy built around an assigned-risk pool, eliminating certain expensive mandates and reforming the counterproductive guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions.\ MILLS: I would fix it. Dirigo should not be supported by a sales tax on health-care costs incurred by those already paying for insurance. I would restrict eligibility to those who are uninsured and I would make subsidies available through all insurance carriers, not just Anthem.\ WOODCOCK: I would reform it. The program is not working. Insurance rates in Maine will not be reduced until we introduce more competition in the insurance market.\ Would you allow more slot machines in Maine, beyond those at the ""racino"" in Bangor?\ EMERY: I would allow an additional racino to support the agricultural fairs and to encourage the development of a horse- breeding industry, provided that the project has the support of the voters in the area in which it would be located.\ MILLS: Only if Maine people directly vote for them.\ WOODCOCK: I would approve similar projects if they had local and statewide support.\ Do you support legalizing same-sex marriage in Maine?\ EMERY: No.\ MILLS: No. Maine law already contains partnership and registry provisions that are available to protect domestic partners. The same rules apply to couples of different sexes as well as to those of the same sex.\ WOODCOCK: No.\ Would you do anything to change Maine's abortion laws?\ EMERY: I am opposed to partial-birth abortion and would favor parental notification in cases where a minor is considering an abortion.\ MILLS: The 1989 compromise law adequately limits abortion. Abortions and unwanted pregnancies are dramatically declining in Maine through education, family planning and moral and emotional counseling. If the common goal is to eliminate the need for abortions, Maine is well on its way to making them as rare as possible.\ WOODCOCK: What Maine can do is limited by the federal courts; however, I believe, among other things, minors should be required to obtain parental consent before having an abortion.\ Should the state keep legislative term limits as they are now, extend them or abolish them?\ EMERY: I am not a fan of legislative term limits, because experience and institutional memory are important to the legislative process. The voters are the best judge of their own elected representatives and should be able to decide if or when a change is necessary.\ MILLS: After a decade of experimenting with term limits, if Maine people vote to do so, I favor extending the House limit to six terms because the House needs better and more experienced leadership. However, the Senate has no difficulty in attracting experienced people and can get along fine with the present four- term restriction.\ WOODCOCK: The people of Maine have spoken on term limits. The only way the law should be changed is through a citizens' initiative.\ Are Learning Results a good way of assessing student performance or should Maine get rid of them?\ EMERY: Testing students is an important accountability tool, but I am concerned that both Maine Learning Results and the federal No Child Left Behind program have resulted in pressure on teachers to ""teach to the test."" All children do not learn in the same manner, so Maine must develop an alternative testing strategy to evaluate schools, teachers and the progress of individual students.\ MILLS: Although Learning Results are important, sensible assessments are even more so. We should annually be measuring growth, or value added, for each child and classroom rather than attempting to define the status of a school through testing at widely separated grade intervals. Teachers and students alike need to be recognized for successful educational growth.\ WOODCOCK: Maine needs to more adequately address the assessment of student progress. Each student should be assessed as part of an individualized program.\ Should Maine reduce the number of school districts through regionalization?\ EMERY: Economies of scale can often be achieved by consolidation or by the sharing of common services among schools and districts. But the state should not impose consolidation on unwilling communities; instead, the state should facilitate and encourage consolidation through financial incentives.\ MILLS: Yes, but we should preserve or perhaps even expand the number of small neighborhood schools at all levels of K-12. To make such schools affordable, we must support them with more efficient administration. Consolidated districts will eliminate redundant administrators, save money through volume purchasing and gain efficiency with fewer bargaining units and more uniform contracts for teachers.\ WOODCOCK: Only if regionalization has local support. It should not be mandated by the state.\ Is Maine's homeland-security apparatus geared up for a disaster?\ EMERY: Probably not. Maine should learn from the Hurricane Katrina disaster and develop a comprehensive emergency action plan that would anticipate the appropriate response to a disaster resulting from weather, disease, a crash, explosion, fire or a terrorist act. Emergency preparedness is a priority and deserves adequate funding and attention from public officials.\ MILLS: I believe so. The state seems to have handled the recent flooding emergency in York County fairly well.\ WOODCOCK: Preparedness is key to dealing with disasters. To that end, as governor I will ensure that the Maine Emergency Management Agency is taking steps necessary to protect Maine citizens in the event of a disaster.\ Is Maine ready to deal with a bird-flu pandemic?\ EMERY: No. Maines preparedness will depend to a great degree upon the production of an effective vaccine in quantities sufficient to protect the populace. Lacking that, Maine must develop an emergency action plan to manage large numbers of critically ill patients, to isolate and contain the spread of disease and to assure the continuity of essential public services.\ MILLS: A pandemic of any kind is to be dreaded by even the most well-prepared of societies. I am sure that the bureau of health has the situation as well under control as can be expected and would be advising the governor otherwise were it not so.\ WOODCOCK: No. Improved coordination of all available services is needed.\ Is the Department of Health and Human Services, which merged two formerly separate agencies, too big?\ EMERY: Yes. It will be necessary to reorganize and reform DHHS in order to manage it more effectively, to reduce costs, and to assure that DHHS money is being used for services for people truly in need, and not for unnecessary bureaucracy.\ MILLS: The issue is not simply one of size but a lack of leadership, poor management, a calcific bureaucracy and entitlement rules that are too expansive.\ WOODCOCK: The merger was intended to reduce administrative costs and to improve services by better coordinating services provided to individuals. To date, the merger has failed to produce such results, due to management instability and lack of executive leadership."
258,"AUGUSTA, Maine -- Maine may see its loudest campaign ever in 2020. The new governor will open her second year in office with issue-based tests and Augusta brinkmanship, and she will end it with a battle for party control of the State House.\Here are the storylines likely to dominate Maine politics for the next year.\Two members of Congress will face difficult and historic tests in deeply nationalized and somewhat mirroring environments. This statement isn't bold, since U.S. Sen. Susan Collins and Rep. Jared Golden of Maine's 2nd District are already in the middle of hard re-election bids, though it's difficult to overstate the scope and noise of the races Maine is about to experience as President Donald Trump is expected to campaign hard to try to win the 2nd District again.\The Republican senator already raised more money than any politician in Maine history for the race by September's end, and more than $10 million has been spent on advertising on the seat. Four Democrats are running for the nomination to face Collins in 2020, led by House Speaker Sara Gideon, who has national party backing in a Democratic-leaning state.\Collins, who became a target for Democrats after her 2018 vote for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, will seek her fifth term in 2020. Golden, a Democrat narrowly elected last year despite President Donald Trump's 10-percentage-point victory in 2016, will face a challenge after splitting his votes on two articles of impeachment against Trump this month.\Both incumbents may be hard outs. Collins won two-thirds of votes in 2014. There's no clear favorite in a three-way Republican primary in the 2nd District. Still, Democrats are buoyed by a Collins approval rating that dropped from 67 percent in early 2017 to 43 percent in 2019's third quarter as measured by Morning Consult. Republicans hope a pro-Trump lean ousts Golden.\Voters could rebuke the new governor for the first time in her tenure, particularly over the Central Maine Power corridor. One of the main pitches that Gov. Janet Mills and fellow Democrats made to voters in the 2018 election was that they would simply implement voter-approved laws. That included Medicaid expansion, which was stalled by former Republican Gov. Paul LePage and enshrined during Mills' first days in office.\That was an easy choice, since a judge had already ruled it would have to take effect. But it was also politically popular and rallied Democrats to a common cause. Being in control of government is another matter. Mills now risks the wrath of voters over two polarizing moves.\She backed Central Maine Power's proposed hydropower corridor through western Maine in February. The project polled badly in March -- particularly in her affected home region of Franklin County -- and more than 20 towns have either opposed it or pulled support. Opponents are gathering signatures to get a question aiming to kill it on the November 2020 ballot.\Mills will face her first test on the ballot in March, when voters will decide whether to uphold a new law ending nonmedical exemptions for school vaccine requirements. Democrats passed the law as a response to rising opt-out rates, but it drew hundreds of opponents at a legislative hearing in March. These are two very different issues, but the governor is the common thread.\It will be difficult for the outgoing Legislature to craft grand bargains in an election year. While Democrats in the Legislature flexed their muscles plenty along party lines in 2019, Mills perhaps differed most from LePage in a desire to craft grand bargains that served many purposes for politicians and advocates in Augusta.\Among the major party-line shifts were repealing the vaccine exemptions, automatic voter registration, expanding abortion access and a so-called ""death with dignity"" law. But there also were broad compromises on paid time off, workers' compensation reform and an alternative to a controversial ""red flag"" law tying gun seizures to mental health diagnoses.\While many progressives wanted to go further, the end products reflected Mills' desire to not overstep in the majority. Republicans wanted to mitigate further-reaching proposals. Groups lobbying the Legislature that were opposed to the original proposals were happy to play ball, knowing Democrats could largely do what they wanted otherwise.\Mills has assembled consensus groups to solve big governmental problems, including panels aimed at addressing an annual transportation shortfall and lowering emissions. Already, Republicans have resisted the idea of raising the gas tax without a constitutional change that would bar bonding for roads and bridges in most cases and voiced frustration with Democratic legislative leaders for not allowing more of their bills to move forward in 2020.\Thorny political questions are wrapped up in each of those issues that will be even harder to solve in an election year for legislators making their cases ahead of the 2020 election.\Legislative Republicans have a straightforward case against Democrats, but wresting control in the 2020 election will be difficult. LePage and Republicans stormed to full control of Augusta in 2010, but it only lasted one term as Democrats campaigned against a tax-cutting budget that most of them voted for and gained back both chambers in 2012.\Democrats are likely to face a rebound in 2020. This year, Republicans instantly hammered Mills' $8 billion, two-year budget proposal. Most grudgingly acceded to a budget just under that mark in June, but it's going to be a main focus of Republican campaigns.\While they are likely to win seats, it may take a while for Republicans to dig out of their 2018 hole. Democrats flipped 12 Republican seats in the House and four in the Senate en route to commanding majorities in 2018. To win control, Republicans would need to flip 16 House seats and four Senate seats.\Their three top targets in the upper chamber could be Michael Carpenter of Houlton, Ned Claxton of Auburn and Linda Sanborn of Gorham, who all won narrowly in 2018. Another could be Sen. Shenna Bellows, D-Manchester, who won a second term easily in a Republican-leaning district. Hallowell Mayor Mark Walker, a third-term Republican who has run unopposed twice in the Democratic stronghold, said he is considering a run against her.\In the House, Democrats have 18 term-limited members compared with only three Republicans, yet all but four are in relatively safe districts. Democrats look over-leveraged after winning eight Republican-leaning districts last year, but it would take a disaster for them to lose House control.\Credit: Michael Shepherd BDN Staff"

I am writing to encourage voters in House District 88 to support Garry Cupples. On a recent campaign stop he made at my parents' and my homes, he surprised us by speaking French, as he is a retired French teacher from Carrabec school.
\
My parents enjoyed being able to discuss the issues in their native language. Cupples was very knowledgeable and responsive to our concerns, expressing his view that government should help people, not hinder them. Cupples explained how the school funding program is unfair to small rural towns and spoke about his determination to protect the environment and create jobs by pursuing renewable energy sources and improving public transportation.
\
My Dad and I were pleased by Cupples' strong support of outdoor activities, as we both enjoy hunting and fishing and the outdoors in general. Cupples displayed a great amount of empathy and caring for the people in his district, talking about how truly poor a lot of people are and how many are struggling just to pay for gas, food, heat, medicine and the other basics they need to just live.
\
I have never seen or heard this level of concern from our current representative Wright Pinkham, who voted against raising the minimum wage and stated, as quoted on the Web site VoteSmart.org, that he wants to ""greatly increase"" the gas tax. Please, we need a representative who will be responsive to our needs and actively advocate for us in Augusta and that person is Cupples.

261," The caption above the photo of Richard Larkin and his wife (BDN, March 9-10) caught my eye: ""Larkin Enterprises making millions building electricity plants."" Finally, a story about a Maine company making good in my back yard.\ Unfortunately, this turned out to be just another story of a company making it despite the Maine business climate that is known for high taxes, huge overheads in transportation and electrical costs and more. Larkin is quoted as saying, ""Maine is just about the worst environment you could possibly be in from a business perspective.""\ It's another sad commentary about Maine's business climate. We are nationally recognized for our shoreline, our lobster, our wood products and as the place for other New Englanders and those from away to vacation. We are also tops in the nation in taxes and one of the lowest in income per capita. We top the list with one of the highest excise taxes in the nation and last fall were rated as one of the worst states for business economic development. Our electrical, telephone, medical insurance and workers' comp costs all combine to drive many businesses from our state to points down south. A purchase of a new computer system or a delivery truck to help your business compete means a higher property tax and more use taxes.\ Our governor said he has been working hard for eight years to increase the business climate. Yet our young continue to leave the state seeking better wages and more opportunities because there are few here in Maine. I, too, enjoy living here, but I look at our neighbors to the immediate west of us and wonder, how do they do it in New Hampshire? They have no sales tax, no income tax, no excise tax, a lower gas tax, no liquor tax and the list of nontaxable items goes on and on. They have better roads, lower operating costs and have attracted many companies from all over the United States to settle in their state. They move ahead while our Legislature is considering taxing Internet sales because its another $40 million we can strap on our small population.\ Where does all the money from taxes in Maine go? To a multitude of liberal programs that help a few but does nothing for increasing business activity in our state.\ Ben Brown\ Dixmont"

WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats, divided over how to pay for President Barack Obama's jobs plan, Wednesday tossed out the White House tax proposals and replaced them with one of their own: a tax increase on millionaires.
\
Obama's plan to increase taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 and joint filers making more than $250,000 was highly unpopular among some Democrats.
\
""Many of them are not rich,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. In many areas of the United States, he added, such an income ""does not get you a big home or lots of vacations or anything else that's associated with wealth in America.""
\
Obama's $447 billion proposal still faces huge trouble in the Democratic-run Senate, where it's expected to be considered next week. Sixty votes are needed to cut off extended debate, and Democrats control 53 of the 100 seats.
\
In addition, the package as a whole is ""dead"" in the Republican-dominated House of Representatives, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said Monday.
\
But at least the millionaire's tax could spare Obama the embarrassment of Democrats abandoning him on a key issue, one that he's been campaigning for day after day.
\
When Senate Democrats returned this week from a weeklong recess, many expressed reservations about different elements of Obama's plan, including the proposal to limit itemized deductions for individuals earning more than $200,000 and joint filers making more than $250,000.
\
Other lawmakers from energy-producing states were annoyed about the plan to close oil and gas tax loopholes.
\
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who opposes the Obama initiative, tried to get the Senate to take an up-or-down vote on the jobs plan, but Democratic leaders blocked the effort.
\
On Wednesday, the package changed, as the Obama taxes were replaced by a 5 percent surtax on income of more than $1 million.
\
Republicans, who have been adamantly opposed to tax increases, immediately signaled they would not go along.
\
""Republicans have identified areas of common ground where we can work with the president and Democrats to create a better environment for job creation,"" said Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""That should be our focus, not desperate tax hike gimmicks floated to cover up divisions within the Democratic caucus.""
\
At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said the administration's priority is passing the legislation and it's open to suggestions for how to pay for it. Carney said he wasn't fully familiar with the Senate proposal, but he suggested it's one ""we think would work.""
\
""The idea that our goal here is to use this as a political weapon, it's not,"" Carney said. ""Our goal is to take action and put Americans back to work.""
\
The current top tax rate is 35 percent.
\
Democrats estimate that taxing millionaires will raise the $447 billion Obama needs to implement his jobs plan. The plan, which would boost spending for road construction, schools and aid to the unemployed, and cut the Social Security payroll tax, is still expected to go nowhere as a complete package.

263,"A new America\This Fourth of July will be more of a memorial service than a birthday. I remember when the American president stood with western democracies. Now our president calls dictators and autocrats his friends. Americans are now comfortable with the president's children and family members working in the White House. Americans are now at ease with cruelty as policy. Americans tolerate corruption. Nepotism is now Americanism. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife are just two examples. So pop your fireworks and celebrate who we once were. Remember fondly the America of old.

Its biological heart, the coastal plain, is no place for oil and gas development.\And yet, the Trump administration -- through language snuck into the 2017 tax bill -- is barreling forward to allow oil and gas drilling within this ecologically sensitive wilderness refuge. This destructive move must be halted.\Rep. Jared Golden has been a champion of the effort to protect the Arctic refuge. I urge the rest of the Maine congressional delegation to do the same. We must keep drills out of the Arctic refuge.\Carissa Maurin\State director\Environment Maine\Biddeford\Belfast business and climate change\Thank you to the BDN for the front-page coverage given to the closure of Belfast's Marshall Wharf Brewing Co. Roughly a million dollars in sales annually, and several local jobs, all lost to climate change. Neither the mandated federal flood insurance nor Federal Emergency Management Agency could apparently respond in time to help the Carlsons save their business.\David Carlson now must turn his loss into an opportunity, and his story could awaken the public to the urgency of the larger situation. Without changing our habits, climate change will continue, and the federal measures such as flood insurance or emergency management will continue to inadequate and overwhelmed.\Yet if we put a price on carbon, our habits will change. Decades of gas taxes, and cap-and-trade policies have attempted to do this, but they have failed in critical ways. The gas tax hurt the consumer, who often never saw the revenue spent in his or her local district. The cap and trade policies demanded that large-scale polluters pay, but ignored the many other sources of carbon dioxide.\Now the fee and dividend approach could correct the inadequacies of these earlier policies. Energy giants would pay a fee at the point of extraction, and that fee would be distributed to citizens as a dividend. Yes, the price of fuel would increase, but consumers would be armed with the revenue needed to meet that challenge.\It will not be an easy transition away from fossil fuels, but we must begin now if we hope to save other coastal Maine businesses from flooding and erosion.\Sue Griffith\Parkman\"
264,"SEARSMONT, Maine -- A new 10-year economic plan for Maine released on Wednesday by Gov. Janet Mills sets goals of growing the workforce by 75,000 people and raising wages by 10 percent in a bid to both stem the economic effects of an aging population.\Few will disagree with the goals in the 44-page plan, which is a largely consensus framework shaped over most of 2019 by a group of state, business and nonprofit interests. But they are lofty and similar efforts have bogged down in the past. Many of the more sweeping policy recommendations will prompt debate over cost and effect in Augusta.\""As we approach our bicentennial, it's time to build on the foundation of our past 200 yars to create a forward-looking economy for the next 200 years,"" Mills said at a news conference at Robbins Lumber in Searsmont. ""That's the goal of this plan.""\The Democratic governor's plan charts three main goals over the next decade. The most ambitious is one to grow Maine's workforce by 75,000 people, running counter to a demographic trend in the nation's oldest state by median age. As things stand, it is expected to contract by 65,000.\[Read the full plan here]\The plan identifies several strategies for meeting those goals, including enhancing the skills of Maine's existing workforce, attracting workers from other places, helping seniors and people with disabilities to work in greater numbers, expanding broadband, improving the state's childcare, transportation and housing systems and streamlining permitting processes.\Among the most ambitious of the 28 policy recommendations in the plan are a universal pre-kindergarten program, a new loan guarantee program for companies that finance broadband expansion projects and enshrining a career exploration program that will follow kids from kindergarten through high school.\Mills said on Wednesday that she will begin pursuing legislation and executive action in early 2020 to begin implementing the plan. Some of the goals -- such as making changes to business permitting process -- can be done by the administration. Mills has tasked her Cabinet with developing a universal pre-K program, which could develop over the course of years.\The overarching goals are nothing new. A need for more research and development funding has been a common refrain in economic development conversations over the past generation. Mills' plan also sets a goal of raising value added per worker by 10 percent over the decade, a measure that has been targeted by the Maine Economic Growth Council and lagged the U.S. average by 25 percent in 2015.\Maine last tried to pull together a similar economic plan in 1993, but the Legislature stripped most of the funding from it. This one was coordinated by the Mills administration with a number of outside partners, including the nonprofit Maine Development Foundation and the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, which endorsed it on Wednesday.\The political environment in Augusta may pose a challenge. Mills is entering her first legislative election cycle in the Blaine House in 2020 and minority Republicans have made the level of spending in a $8 billion two-year budget a main issue with the governor.\For example, a commission that aimed to find more money for the state's embattled transportation system has deadlocked so far on raising the gas tax. Solving that problem -- given an estimated $232 million shortfall for road and bridge maintenance -- is also identified as a goal in Mills' economic plan.\What do think about the plan? Do you have questions about it? Let us know in the comments.\Credit: Michael Shepherd BDN Staff"

Kelly, a paralegal, said she wants to help create a better environment for people to raise families.\ Diamond, 61, a former Maine secretary of state, said he wants to continue working in the Legislature, pointing to bills he helped pass, such as ""Tina's Law."" It increases penalties for the worst driving offenders and gives judges discretion to hand down stiffer sentences for suspended drivers who seriously injure another motorist.\ Diamond said he wants to see more bipartisan collaboration on legislation, especially in areas like tax reform.\ He also wants to continue programs that get citizens involved in government, such as the Youth Caucus, where student leaders meet with legislators.\ Diamond said he opposes the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, or TABOR, a citizen referendum intended to cap government spending on the state and local levels according to various formulas. He said it raises too many questions and could lead to a number of unintended consequences.\ Kelly said she supports TABOR, saying the state needs to set boundaries on its spending levels.\ She said the state needs to cut taxes that are strangling businesses. By reducing taxes, slowing minimum-wage increases and decreasing health-insurance costs, the state would attract more businesses, she said.\ She said she also favors repealing automatic increases in the gas tax.\ Kelly said the state is neglecting its responsibility to take care of older people and can better supervise Maine's nursing homes.\ She opposes any expansion of casino-style gambling in the state. She said the state can be more creative in finding ways to stimulate the economy than relying on gambling.\ Diamond said he only favors slot machine gambling attached to harness-racing tracks, such as Hollywood Slots in Bangor. Diamond said the so-called ""racinos"" can be a boon to the state as well as the harness-racing and agricultural community.\ Diamond said the state needs to expand its Pine Tree Zone program, which offers tax breaks to companies that start up businesses in certain parts of the state.\ He also said the state should continue to explore the possibility of expanding passenger and freight rail lines. Diamond said re- establishing rail lines to towns like Fryeburg could help stimulate economic development and also alleviate traffic congestion in some areas.\ Staff Writer Justin Ellis can be contacted at 791-6380 or\ jellis@pressherald.com"

And Michael Wakefield is the Green, a political newcomer who adds a political twist to the contest.\Voters will decide the race on Nov. 4.\Bryant, 52, who has worked to change the Dirigo health insurance program and focus attention on Lyme disease among other things, said his four years' experience will help him face such issues as the looming budget deficit.\""The first priority is taking care of the budget,"" he said. The gap appears to be so large that it'll take both cuts and tax increases to balance the budget.\""I don't think you can cut your way out of it, and I don't think you can raise taxes enough to get out of it,"" he said.\Bryant said the state's tax structure needs to be reformed and broadened so government doesn't rely so heavily on construction and sales tax revenues. He also said the Legislature has to provide more funding for roads and bridges, especially as gas tax revenue falls.\Bryant said another top priority will be providing aid to the elderly and families that can't afford heat this winter. He has also helped launch support efforts in the community.\Haskell, 56, is running against Bryant for a third time - he ran in the Democratic primary in 2004 and as a Republican in 2006 - and said he is frustrated with the tax-and-spend attitude of Bryant and the Legislature as a whole.\""They seem to think that money grows on trees in Augusta, and the poor old taxpayers ... are kind of tired of it,"" Haskell said.\He said the Legislature's vote to place a tax on beer, wine and soda to pay for Dirigo was ""a shady deal from the start, and they ought to be punished for it by taking them out of office.""\Haskell said he would address the budget deficit by cutting the size of state government. ""I believe there are a lot of departments up there that are way over what they need for personnel,"" he said.\However, he said, the natural resources agencies, such as Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and Agriculture, should not be cut because they generate revenue for state government and serve core industries.\Wakefield, a Green Independent candidate who grew up in northern Maine, said he would focus on supporting the state's agriculture industry and protecting its environment.\""I want to keep agriculture strong and sustainable,"" he said.\Wakefield said organic farming is a better alternative to the use of pesticides and other chemicals, as well as to genetically engineered crops. ""It's more labor intensive, but it's more beneficial in the long term,"" he said.\Wakefield also supports the phase out of potentially dangerous chemicals from consumer products when safer alternatives are available.\He said the state should develop renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency, such as by insulating homes.\""These green industry jobs are the new job growth market,"" he said.

BETHEL - After learning Wednesday afternoon that Gov. John Baldacci proposed emergency legislation to give logging truckers temporary relief from high diesel prices by increasing the wood weight they can haul, Bethel logger Don Bennett chuckled.
\
State law sets a weight limit of 100,000 pounds for six-axle tractor-trailers operating on Maine's roads and bridges. Baldacci's bill - LD 2155, An Act to Assist Maine's Forest Products Industry - would allow an increase to 105,000 pounds until April 1. This, proponents say, will help logging truckers consolidate loads and save on fuel.
\
""It's a Band-Aid, obviously, and it provides very little bit of help, in my mind,"" Bennett said.
\
Baldacci's bill isn't going to help much, he said, because the federal government wants to raise the road fuel tax by 5 to 6 cents to help pay for the nation's transportation infrastructure.
\
He was talking about the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission, which was created by Congress in 2005.
\
On Tuesday, the commission released its plan to Congress to improve the performance of the nation's transport system.
\
To pay for investments of at least $225 billion annually from all sources, the commission recommends tapping new revenue sources, including increasing the federal gas tax between 25 to 40 cents in annual increments of 5 to 8 cents per gallon, according to a commission news release on Tuesday.
\
""You get help from one and get pooped on by the other. It's ironic, because on the one hand, they say we can haul more payload to save a few pennies, and on the other hand in Washington, they say we're going to add a few more pennies on, because they say we're destroying roads and bridges with our heavier payloads,"" Bennett said.
\
The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has scheduled a hearing on the report today, and the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works has tentatively scheduled a hearing on it Wednesday, Jan. 23.
\
In Maine, Baldacci's bill was OK'd by the House on Tuesday, but the Senate wanted a hearing, which will be held by the Legislature's Transportation Committee at 1 p.m. today in Room 126 at the State House in Augusta.
\
Afterward, the committee will conduct a work session on LD 2155, then vote on it.
\
The bill then heads to the House for a vote on Tuesday, Jan. 22, and on to the Senate.
\
""It's entirely possible to get it passed by both chambers on Tuesday and it can become law,"" said Travis Kennedy, House Majority Office spokesman.
\
A major economic engine for Maine, the forest products industry has been hard hit by rising fuel prices.
\
Bennett said he employs three people in his business, Bennett's Lumbering, using only a few pieces of equipment. With the price of diesel fuel at $3.75 a gallon, it costs him between $1,500 and $1,800 a week for fuel.
\
""With a couple of guys and small machines, it's easy to eat up 500 gallons of fuel. At $500 per week times four weeks in a month, (to offset it) my little three-man crew must find ways to increase production to get another three to four trailer loads a month.
\
""Perhaps we do need a crisis ... Sometimes a crisis is the catalyst that turns angry Democrats and Republicans into people who shake hands and get things done. It needs to happen, but we shall see,"" Bennett said.

269," Nationally, ATV accidents and fatalities are on the rise. And Maine is no different.\ A growing number of riders are getting hurt across the country as ATVs go off roads, flip in ditches and collide. Those statistics are in line with the increasing number of registered ATVs across the country.\ And, in those states with the highest ATV use, officials say education and improved trails are the best way to help curb ATV accidents.\ However, in many of these states, new laws have yet to put much of a dent in the increasing number of ATV crashes.\ Maine has seen a jump from 166 reported ATV accidents and four fatalities in 1998 to 268 accidents and nine fatalities in 2005.\ There were 63,000 registered ATVs in Maine in 2005, up from 44,800 in 2000.\ ""We've seen about a 10 percent growth a year for the past 10 years (in registration),"" said Brian Bronson, Maine's state ATV coordinator.\ ""There is general speculation that it will continue to climb. There is even a fair amount of speculation that ATVs will outnumber (the state's 100,000 registered) snowmobiles.""\ According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the number of ATV riders nationwide has increased by 36 percent since 1997 - from 12 million to more than 16 million.\ ""In Minnesota they are predicting in the next five years the registration may double. And we currently have a number around 280,000 registered ATVs,"" said Michael Hammer, the education coordinator with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\ Officials in several high-ATV-use states, including Maine, say the growth in sales means a jump in accidents as well.\ ""Michigan is fourth in the nation for ATV sales and registration. Interestingly enough, we are also fourth highest in the nation for the number of crashes and deaths involving ATVs,"" said Mary Dettloff, public information officer with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.\ Last year, there were 160,000 registered ATV riders in Michigan.\ And, in 2004, Michigan had 13 fatalities, an increase from 2002 and 2003, when there were 11, although crashes dropped from more than 300 to 270.\ In the past two years, Pennsylvania, which has 168,000 registered ATVs, went from 26 fatalities to 42, said Brady Terry, the deputy press secretary with the state's Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.\ The total accidents also jumped from 255 in 2004 to 397 in 2005, Terry said.\ Most state officials who work with natural resource departments say derelict riders breaking the laws cause accidents.\ Terry said all the accidents in Pennsylvania were on private land, not on the state's well-policed 2.1 million acres of state forestland that is open to ATV use and has marked trails.\ ""That's people riding illegally, or riding on the street,"" Terry said.\ In Minnesota, where accidents gradually increased from 179 in 1999 to 323 in 2004, most accidents happen on private property, mostly on roads and in ditches, said Michael Hammer with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\ To combat these rogue riders, officials say education, not fines, is the best answer.\ In New Hampshire, fatalities have dropped, from six in 2002 to two in 2005, and Capt. Marty Garabedin with the Fish and Game Department said that is because of an ""aggressive education program for youths 12 and older.""\ In Minnesota, a 4-year-old law requires that youths ages 12 to 15 take an education course and obtain a certificate to show if they are stopped.\ And Michigan also has a law that requires those under the age of 16 to take an approved training class.\ In Maine, where a training course is required for youths ages 10 to 16, state officials believe that more well-marked ATV trails maintained by the state's 135 active clubs eventually will create an environment of safe riding.\ This is why Maine's ATV state coordinator, Bronson, said a new law that will create four state positions to work on trails will reduce accidents.\ ""We'll probably put $1 million into ATV trail construction this year alone,"" Bronson said, referring to the state's pre-existing trail fund.\ The four new club liaisons will cost the state $125,000 a year and will be paid for from the state's trail fund, which is funded from a portion of the gas tax and ATV registration, Bronson said.\ Bronson said that by expanding clubs and club-sponsored trails, the message to ride safe will spread to all riders.\ And he believes that, ultimately, will reduce accidents.\ ""When I go to the Maine Farm Bureau and they tell me they had no complaints last year, that's huge,"" Bronson said.\ Staff Writer Deirdre Fleming can be contacted at 791-6452 or at:\ dfleming@pressherald.com"
270,"WASHINGTON -- Congress started July - its last full working month before the November elections - with a full plate. But it may not have the appetite to handle it all. \At the top of lawmakers' to-do list is passing at least temporary funding for the Highway Trust Fund, which helps finance major road projects throughout the country and is projected to run out of money by late August. \Both chambers also need to advance a slate of government funding bills that must be passed by Sept. 30 to avert another government shutdown. \Finally, there's the fight over whether to renew the Export-Import Bank and President Obama's latest request for $3.7 billion in funds to address the border crisis. \But it's unclear whether a Congress that is already known as one of the least productive on record will get all of that done. \First, time is running out. After this month, the House has just 12 working days planned before the Nov. 4 elections. The Senate is scheduled to be in session for September and October, but with control of the chamber at stake in November, few expect that to happen. \And even as they face a series of time-sensitive votes, both parties continue to push symbolic legislation that has little hope of passage but appeals to their respective bases in an election year. \Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., for example, told reporters Tuesday that he was committed to taking action in the Senate to address the Supreme Court's ruling in the Hobby Lobby case. That decision gave businesses owned by devout Christians the right to refuse to pay for insurance covering contraceptives for female employees. \Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Mark Udall, D-Colo., unveiled a bill Wednesday to prohibit for-profit companies from denying any health coverage, including contraceptives, guaranteed to their employees under the Affordable Care Act. A companion bill will be introduced by Democrats in the House, though it's highly unlikely that Republican leaders will allow the plan to get a vote. \The Republican-led House, meanwhile, is preparing to spend one of its remaining work days voting to initiate a lawsuit against Obama for what the Republican leadership says is his failure to execute the nation's laws as his oath requires. \Nevertheless, lawmakers are likely to tick off at least one item from their list. \In a break from gridlock, the House was expected to give approval Wednesday to a compromise measure that would consolidate federal programs that provide job-skills training and help workers find employment. The Senate passed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 95-3 last month. \""This is example of steps that can be taken to help Americans get back to work,"" John Boehner said before the vote Wednesday. ""It's also an example where you've got a bipartisan effort in the House with a bipartisan effort in the Senate coming together to address the needs of the American people."" \But other initiatives that have bipartisan support may not move as quickly. Replenishing the Highway Trust Fund has been a priority for lawmakers in both parties, particularly as the construction season enters its peak. But after an apparent breakthrough before the Fourth of July recess between key House and Senate leaders, both chambers may be again moving on separate tracks. \On Thursday the House Ways and Means Committee plans to vote on a proposal from Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., to provide more than $10 billion in funding to sustain the trust fund through next May. The primary source of funds is through what's known as ""pension smoothing,"" which allows businesses to defer payments to pension funds and thus increase the amount of taxable income in the short term. \Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., was expected to announce a revised proposal Tuesday, though negotiations are continuing with Republican members of the panel. Members of both parties have called the new House proposal insufficient. Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee, who has proposed raising the gas tax to replenish the trust fund, said Camp's plan amounts to ""generational theft"" because it relies on borrowing money. \""The kind of patch they're talking about keeps the indecision out there for months and months,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee.\Credit: By Michael A. Memoli"
271,"SABATTUS - Federal officials said Wednesday that Maine is the first state in the nation to pass several milestones for use of stimulus dollars flowing from Washington, D.C., for highway improvements and environmental cleanup projects.\Maine has committed 100 percent of the more than $130 million in stimulus money the state will receive for bridge and highway projects. That is well ahead of the benchmark set by federal officials of 50 percent of stimulus funding committed to specific projects by June 29.\The state also has committed 50 percent of the nearly $50 million Maine will receive for drinking water projects and wastewater infrastructure.\""This is really a red-letter day for Maine,"" Jonathan McDade, Maine division administrator for the Federal Highway Administration, said during a press event in Sabattus touting the state agencies' track record so far. ""They have really stepped up and shown themselves to be a model for other states.""\Gov. John Baldacci's office estimates that 30 bridge or highway projects funded with stimulus dollars are under way, accounting for more than 750 jobs.\The largest single project - which is also the most controversial - is the $35.5 million reconstruction of Interstate 295 between Brunswick and Gardiner. DOT officials claim I-295's road bed was crumbling internally, forcing the costly repairs.\Other projects either under way or being bid out include a $10.7 million reconstruction of slightly less than 3 miles of Route 1A near Ellsworth and a $5 million substructure rehabilitation of the Deer Isle-Sedgwick Bridge.\""Our goal has been to take advantage of these funds for much-needed projects to put people to work,"" Baldacci said.\Tuesday's event was held after several weeks of intense debate over how to pay for upkeep of Maine's crumbling roads. Lawmakers rejected several proposals to increase Maine's gas tax during the recession in order to make more headway on the long list of road repairs.\Then last week, the Maine Department of Transportation announced that it was canceling more than 130 ""maintenance paving"" projects throughout the state - including all of the projects planned for 2010 - because the maintenance coffers had run dry.\Maine is slated to receive $131 million in highway funding from the economic stimulus package that passed Congress earlier this year. Stimulus funding was intended for ""shovel-ready projects,"" but it cannot be used for just any road repairs.\State officials are restricted to using that money for long-term repairs on federal highways or major capital improvements of roads or bridges, such as rebuilding or widening projects. Stimulus dollars cannot be used to patch potholes, fill in frost heave cracks or put a thin layer of asphalt over deteriorating roads - in other words, the so-called ""maintenance paving"" projects canceled by the DOT due to insufficient funding.\""If I could have used federal stimulus money to pave more of those roads, I would have. But I don't make the rules,"" DOT commissioner David Cole said afterward.\Maine is also slated to receive $29 million for wastewater infrastructure projects as well as $19.5 million for drinking water projects. Again, Maine was the first state in the nation to commit at least 50 percent of its water-related stimulus funds.\About half of the wastewater-related projects involve separating sewer and storm-water infrastructure to prevent raw sewage from spilling out into rivers and streams during heavy storms.\The city of Bangor also will receive more than $2.5 million for storm-water management in the Penjajawoc and Birch streams, both of which are polluted largely due to runoff from nearby development.\Machias also will receive money to upgrade the city's wastewater treatment plant, which state environment commissioner David Littell said is key to eventually reopening to harvesters several clam flats now closed due to polluted runoff.\Littell said the federal funding would help address some of the backlog of wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects in the state.\A list of the stimulus money slated to come to Maine and how the funds are being allocated is available online at www.maine.gov/recovery.\kmiller@bangordailynews.net\990-8250"
272,"
When tax season rolls around, it's only natural for taxpayers to wonder just what their hard-earned federal tax dollars pay for, anyway.
\
Washington will spend $25,117 per household in 2008 - the highest total since World War II, and an inflation-adjusted $4,300 more than in 2001. The federal government will collect $21,604 per household in taxes. The remaining $3,513 represents this year's budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.
\
Washington will spend this $25,117 per household as follows:
\
Social Security/Medicare: $8,668. The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of these costs. This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers. If nothing is done, taxes eventually will need to rise by $12,000 per household (adjusted for both inflation and rising incomes) to pay all promised benefits.
\
Defense: $5,204. The defense budget covers everything from military salaries to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the research, development and acquisition of new technologies. Lawmakers drastically reduced defense spending after the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The 9/11 attacks reversed this trend, and the inflation-adjusted $1,794 per household increase since 2001 has returned defense spending closer to its historical levels.
\
Antipoverty programs: $3,752. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. Other low-income spending includes: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, housing subsidies, child-care subsidies, Supplemental Security Income and low-income tax credits. Despite recent rhetoric about ""cuts for poor,"" federal antipoverty spending now tops 3 percent of GDP for the first time ever, and state and local governments add an additional 2 percent of GDP.
\
Interest on the federal debt: $2,090. The federal government is $9.6 trillion in debt. It owes $5.4 trillion to public bond owners, and the rest to other federal agencies (mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund, which lawmakers raid annually). Despite rising debt, record-low interest rates have limited costs. As interest rates rise back to normal levels, these costs will spike.
\
Federal employee retirement benefits: $935. This spending funds the retirement and disability benefits of federal employees, including the military.
\
Veterans benefits: $742. The federal government provides income and health benefits to war veterans. Spending is up 47 percent since 2001.
\
Health research/regulation: $692. This spending is up 44 percent since 2001, and much of this growth is concentrated in the National Institute of Health. The category also includes the Food and Drug Administration and dozens of grant programs for health providers.
\
Education: $578. Education spending is primarily a state and local function; 9 percent of the total comes from Washington. Federal education spending has surged 47 percent since the 2001 enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act. Most federal dollars are spent on low-income school districts, special education and college student financial aid.
\
Highways/mass transit: $455. Most highway and mass-transit spending is financed by the 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gas tax. Washington subtracts an administrative cost and sends this money back to the states with numerous strings attached. Some economists suggest it would be more efficient to let states collect this tax and decide how to spend the money themselves.
\
Justice administration: $396. Justice spending includes federal attorneys and prisons, as well as law enforcement grant programs. New homeland security costs have added $100 per household to justice spending.
\
Unemployment benefits: $320. Unemployment costs fluctuate based on the number of unemployed Americans.
\
Natural resources/environment: $305. This includes national parks, federal lands, water projects and environmental clean-up.
\
International affairs: $298. This includes foreign economic and military assistance, operation of American embassies abroad, and contributions to organizations such as the United Nations. International spending has nearly doubled since 9/11.
\
The programs listed above cover $24,435 per household. The remaining $682 is allocated to all other federal programs, including regional development, farm subsidies, social services, space exploration, air transportation and energy.
\
Taxpayers must decide for themselves if they're getting their money's worth.Brian Riedl is the Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal budgetary affairs in the Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.

273,"On June 25, I read, with a fair amount of agita, ""Maine public safety commissioner admits: Secret police unit gathers information on citizens"" (Page A1). Notably: ""...He (Commissioner Michael Sauschuck) acknowledged under questioning that the (fusion) center does gather intelligence on citizens, including groups that organize public protests."" Unfortunately, the 250-word limit is neither enough to begin to unpack all that is wrong with that statement nor to place it in historic context with numerous non-democratic, despotic regimes that do the same despicable thing.\Hoping to quell uneasiness, I assume, Sauschuck further commented, ""We are not spying on people. This is public information that is readily available.""\The following are the top two definitions of ""intelligence"" from Google: 1) ""the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills""; 2) ""the collection of information of military or political value.""\The first seems benign, the second sinister and at odds with the commissioner's feign of innocent intent by suggesting that his gathering of public information is not ""intelligence"" until after it is collected and curated by said secret unit. I'd add the definition of spying, but I suspect, like pornography, I'm pretty sure ""we all know it when we see it.""\Since this information is acknowledged as public, readily available and gathered by taxpayer dollars, I look forward to its release to the subjects, the public, for immediate review as well as its deletion from police data banks. If it's that public and readily available, the good folks at the fusion center can just Google it when they need it again!\Mike DelTergo\Falmouth\Lawmakers should close unconstitutional center\The Fusion Center, aka The Maine Police Central Spy Agency, discussed in the Press Herald on June 25 (Page A1), could not obtain any warrant-free information in a timely manner without facial-recognition software. I say this as a former IT professional.\This software labels camera surveillance, giving names, capturing information about Mainers, peaceful protesters, innocent citizens and group members, bypassing all required warrants and legal safeguards that are constitutionally protected.\Those who defend this agency are showing us how dictators act. We must stand up as a free people and say ""No."" We must not only make this kind of activity illegal, but we also must insist that every bit of this information be destroyed and observed by witnesses (with IT expertise) representing the public as well as documentation of its destruction. Nothing less should be tolerated.\We will be closely watching our Legislature for following up their hearings with real, verifiable actions to shut this process down. Such an agency should never be tolerated by a free people. The Constitution provides the police with the right to go before a judge and request a search warrant pertaining to a crime. The Fusion Center bypasses the Constitution, which is the safeguard of our freedom.\David M.W. Travers\Westbrook\District 47 candidate Abbott on workers' side\As a working mom and resident of Yarmouth, I join thousands of Mainers and millions of Americans who are deeply concerned about the availability of jobs that pay a living wage and the opportunity to join a union. This issue will be paramount as I step into the ballot box this July to vote in the Democratic primary for Maine House District 47. Heather Abbott will definitely have my vote.\I know that Heather, as our state representative, will support the right of Mainers to join a union and she will work to ensure that Maine jobs provide fair and livable wages, include health care and retirement benefits and are free of discrimination and workplace harassment.

He knows that climate change will have a massive, negative impact on Maine and that dependence on carbon must be reduced to very low amounts.\Over the last 60 years, I have had many roles in Maine's environmental movement. I'm encouraged to see today's young people pushing toward even greater action. Charles will make a great legislator, and I ask that you give him your strong support.\Richard ""Dick"" Anderson\commissioner, Maine Department of Conservation, 1981-1987\Portland\Gideon hasn't earned a shot at Senate seat\Maine deserves legislators who will fight for us. Unfortunately, Sara Gideon, Maine's House speaker and candidate for the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination, has repeatedly tried to raise taxes on all Mainers. She supported a gas tax that would have cost drivers $10 more every time we filled up, calling it ""one of the most important things we have to do.""\Now, when thousands suffer in the ongoing unemployment mess, she won't show up to help fix the problems that need fixing. This is totally unacceptable and unconscionable! The Legislature has done next to nothing since COVID-19 struck, even though many claimants still await their payments.\Gideon left the State House 100 days ago and has been campaigning since. That's not responsible leadership. We need to ensure Sara Gideon never gets the chance to do to America what she has done to Maine during this crisis. She hasn't lifted a finger to help.\David Hall\Cornish\"
274,"Lawmakers have less than a month to get a $105 million borrowing package on the November ballot or risk upending the state's highway repair program.\ \The state’s top transportation official says next year’s entire highway repair program is at risk if lawmakers don’t return to Augusta in the next two weeks and vote to put a highway borrowing package on the November ballot.\“We normally bid out $350 million for just our core highway and bridge program — if we don’t get a bond, half of that could be gone,” said Maine Transportation Commissioner Bruce Van Note in an interview Tuesday.\“This bond is mission- critical,” Van Note added. “They have to do it this month or we are going to be in a world of hurt.” Three months ago Gov. Janet Mills proposed borrowing $239 million over two years for economic development, environment and transportation programs. That proposal included a $105 million bond to fund highway work, ports, rail and airports next year.\But lawmakers failed to pass the bond package before they adjourned in June, leaving state transportation planners and private contractors uncertain when, or if, the money will come through.\An Aug. 30 deadline to get bond language on the ballot looms, and there’s still no date to reconvene the Legislature, which has put transportation planners on edge as they start to prepare next year’s work plan.\The transportation bond is the latest in five consecutive years of state borrowing to shore up a chronically underfunded maintenance and repair program for Maine’s aging highways and bridges. The sale of state bonds is anticipated to fund 20% of the state’s highway program next year and provide critical matches for federal funding.\“Is this really the best way to fund transportation programs?” Van Note said. “I get why people say ‘why are we bonding all the time,’ right now we appear to be overly reliant on it.”\Mills is contemplating a special session to consider bonds near the end of August, but no firm date has been set, said spokeswoman Lindsay Crete.\“Gov. Mills is continuing to bring lawmakers together to pass a bond package that invests in our economy and addresses the most critical challenges facing our state,” Crete said in an email. “Gov. Mills believes strongly in sending a bond package that tackles these challenges head on to the Maine people for consideration in November.”\House Republicans support a vote on the transportation bond, but want to consider the rest of Mills’ package when lawmakers reconvene in January, said Minority House Leader Kathleen Dillingham, R-Oxford in an interview. The same conflict sank bond issues in the final hours of the legislative session. General obligation bonds need two-thirds support in both houses of the Legislature and a majority vote by state voters.\“We fully support the transportation bond, especially the piece of it specifically for the road infrastructure and bridges,” Dillingham said.\Stakeholders on both side of the aisle believe lawmakers will eventually come back to settle the issue because the transportation funding question is too critical to ignore.\“We have to do something by the end of the month and I fully expect we will,” said Sen. Bill Diamond, D-Windham, Senate chairman of the Legislature’s Transportation Committee. “The crux of the matter is we need a transportation bond and both Republicans and Democrats agree to that.”\This is unfortunately a familiar situation, said Matt Marks, president and CEO of Associated General Contracts of Maine. The state’s reliance on annual bonding for highway funding makes it vulnerable to hiccups such as a legislative delay and executive action. Bonds are also subject to voter approval which has historically been overwhelming, but never guaranteed.\“What we put ourselves in is this ‘just in time’ thing which really doesn’t benefit the state or companies,” Marks said. “It is really just a lot of heartache all around.”\A conflict between former Gov. Paul LePage and Treasurer Terry Hayes in 2017 held up the sale of transportation bonds and the former governor stalled on bond sales again last year.\That means construction companies can’t be sure of state highway contracts, making it a gamble to line up equipment and labor. For the state, delays mean pushing bidding further into the season and into heavier competition with public and private work. That’s amid skyrocketing construction prices that forced the state to cancel $59 million in highway projects this year.\“We are so far behind, we are passing this stuff literally months before they have to go out to bid,” Marks said.\“It is costing the state more to do it this way,” he added. “Why we decide to do this on an annual basis is beyond me.”\There is a consensus that Maine’s highway funding system needs serious reconsideration. Without bonding, the state would have an annual highway shortfall of about $160 million. The last time the gas tax was raised — the highway fund’s primary financing method — was in 2011. Years of proposals for new funding, from fees on electric vehicles, seasonal gas taxes or added fees and sales tax allotments, have gone nowhere.\A new bipartisan blue ribbon commission set up this year is expected to consider a full range of options to fund the highway program. It is supposed to submit a report and suggested legislation to the Legislature by early December.\ \Peter McGuire — 791-6325\pmcguire@pressherald.com\Twitter: @PeteL_McGuire"

That proposal included a $105 million bond to fund highway work, ports, rail and airports next year.\But lawmakers failed to pass the bond package before they adjourned in June, leaving state transportation planners and private contractors uncertain when, or if, the money will come through.\An Aug. 30 deadline to get bond language on the ballot looms and there’s still no date to reconvene the Legislature, which has put transportation planners on edge as they start to prepare next year’s work plan.\The transportation bond is the latest in five consecutive years of state borrowing to shore up a chronically underfunded maintenance and repair program for Maine’s aging highways and bridges. The sale of state bonds is anticipated to fund 20 percent of the state’s highway program next year and provide critical matches for federal funding.\“Is this really the best way to fund transportation programs?” Van Note said. “I get why people say ‘why are we bonding all the time,’ right now we appear to be overly reliant on it.”\Mills is contemplating a special session to consider bonds near the end of August, but no firm date has been set, said spokeswoman Lindsay Crete.\“Gov. Mills is continuing to bring lawmakers together to pass a bond package that invests in our economy and addresses the most critical challenges facing our state,” Crete said in an email. “Gov. Mills believes strongly in sending a bond package that tackles these challenges head on to the Maine people for consideration in November.”\House Republicans support a vote on the transportation bond, but want to consider the rest of Mills’ package when lawmakers reconvene in January, said Minority House Leader Kathleen Dillingham, R-Oxford in an interview. The same conflict sank bond issues in the final hours of the legislative session. General obligation bonds need two-thirds support in both houses of the Legislature and a majority vote by state voters.\“We fully support the transportation bond, especially the piece of it specifically for the road infrastructure and bridges,” Dillingham said.\Stakeholders on both side of the aisle believe lawmakers will eventually come back to settle the issue because the transportation funding question is too critical to ignore.\“We have to do something by the end of the month and I fully expect we will,” said Sen. Bill Diamond, D-Windham, Senate chairman of the Legislature’s Transportation Committee. “The crux of the matter is we need a transportation bond and both Republicans and Democrats agree to that.”\This is unfortunately a familiar situation, said Matt Marks, president and CEO of Associated General Contracts of Maine. The state’s reliance on annual bonding for highway funding makes it vulnerable to hiccups such as a legislative delay and executive action. Bonds are also subject to voter approval which has historically been overwhelming, but never guaranteed.\“What we put ourselves in is this ‘just in time’ thing which really doesn’t benefit the state or companies,” Marks said. “It is really just a lot of heartache all around.”\A conflict between former Gov. Paul LePage and Treasurer Terry Hayes in 2017 held up the sale of transportation bonds and the former governor stalled on bond sales again last year.\That means construction companies can’t be sure of state highway contracts, making it a gamble to line up equipment and labor. For the state, delays mean pushing bidding further into the season and into heavier competition with public and private work. That’s amid skyrocketing construction prices that forced the state to cancel $59 million in highway projects this year.\“We are so far behind, we are passing this stuff literally months before they have to go out to bid,” Marks said.\“It is costing the state more to do it this way,” he added. “Why we decide to do this on an annual basis is beyond me.”\There is a consensus that Maine’s highway funding system needs serious reconsideration. Without bonding, the state would have an annual highway shortfall of about $160 million. The last time the gas tax was raised — the highway fund’s primary financing method — was in 2011. Years of proposals for new funding, from fees on electric vehicles, seasonal gas taxes or added fees and sales tax allotments, have gone nowhere.\A new bipartisan blue ribbon commission set up this year is expected to consider a full range of options to fund the highway program. It is supposed to submit a report and suggested legislation to the Legislature by early December.\ \Peter McGuire — 791-6325\pmcguire@pressherald.com\Twitter: @PeteL_McGuire"

Taxpayers rushing to complete their 1040s before the April 17 tax deadline may stop to wonder: What are these steep federal taxes going for?
\
Washington will spend $24,106 per household in 2007 - the highest total since World War II, and an inflation-adjusted $4,000 more than in 2001. The federal government will collect $21,992 per household in taxes. The remaining $2,114 represents this year's budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.
\
Washington will spend this $24,106 per household as follows:
\
Social Security/Medicare: $8,301. The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of these costs. This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers. If nothing is done, taxes eventually will need to rise by $11,651 per household (adjusted for both inflation and rising incomes) to pay all promised benefits.
\
Defense: $4,951. The defense budget covers everything from military salaries to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the research, development and acquisition of new technologies. Lawmakers drastically reduced defense spending following the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The Sept. 11 attacks reversed this trend, and the inflation-adjusted $1,618 per household increase since 2001 has returned defense spending closer to its historical levels.
\
Anti-poverty programs: $3,550. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. Other low-income spending includes: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, housing subsidies, child-care subsidies, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and low-income tax credits. Despite recent rhetoric about ""cuts for poor,"" federal anti-poverty spending now tops 3 percent of GDP for the first time ever, and state and local governments add another 2 percent of GDP.
\
Interest on the federal debt: $2,071. The federal government is $9 trillion in debt. It owes $5 trillion to public bond owners, and the rest to other federal agencies (mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund, which lawmakers raid annually). Despite rising debt, record-low interest rates have limited costs. As interest rates rise back to normal levels, these costs will spike.
\
Federal employee retirement benefits: $907. This spending funds the retirement and disability benefits of federal employees, including the military.
\
Health research/regulation: $664. This spending is up 51 percent since 2001, and much of this growth is concentrated in the National Institute of Health. The category also includes the Food and Drug Administration and dozens of grant programs for health providers.
\
Veterans benefits: $627. The federal government provides income and health benefits to war veterans. Spending is up 36 percent since 2001.
\
Education: $584. Education spending is primarily a state and local function; 9 percent of the total comes from Washington. Federal education spending has surged 62 percent since the 2001 enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act. Most federal dollars are spent on low-income school districts, special education and college student financial aid.
\
Highways/mass transit: $418. Most highway and mass-transit spending is financed by the 18.4 cent per-gallon federal gas tax.
\
Washington subtracts an administrative cost and sends this money back to the states with numerous strings attached. Some economists suggest it would be more efficient to let states collect this tax and decide how to spend the money themselves.
\
Justice administration: $392. Justice spending includes federal attorneys and prisons, as well as law enforcement grant programs. New homeland security costs have added $100 per household to justice spending.
\
Natural resources/environment: $305. This includes national parks, federal lands, water projects and environmental clean-up.
\
International affairs: $304. This includes foreign economic and military assistance, operation of American embassies abroad, and contributions to organizations such as the United Nations. International spending has nearly doubled since Sept. 11.
\
Unemployment benefits: $299. Unemployment costs fluctuate based on the number of unemployed Americans. This year, unemployment costs are decreasing as job growth continues.
\
Community and regional development: $282. The doubling of spending in this category since 2004 comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is financing much of the Hurricane Katrina relief.
\
The programs listed above cover $23,655 per household. The remaining $451 is allocated to all other federal programs, including farm subsidies, social services, space exploration, air transportation and energy.
\
Taxpayers must decide for themselves if they're getting their money's worth.Brian Riedl is the Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal budgetary affairs in the Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.

278,"I would like to publicly request that both of our U.S. senators, Susan Collins and Angus King, begin to host regular open town hall meetings across Maine, starting now.\It appears that other senators do this, yet ours do not. It would give their Maine constituents an opportunity to ask some tough questions, versus the always-positive Facebook posts and news releases they are sending out.\In particular, I'd like to hear Sen. Collins defend her support of some of the federal judges she has recently voted to approve. The Portland Press Herald's publication of weekly coverage of ""How Maine's members of Congress voted"" has been very enlightening, and the senators should come home and explain their support or nonsupport of numerous bills in public forums.\If you agree, please contact their offices and make this request. They won't do it unless pressured.\Pamela Smith\North Yarmouth\Local-option tax would add to Mainers' burden\Increasingly, concerns arise with this legislative session about proposals to raise taxes on Mainers. One of the most egregious efforts resides in L.D. 1254, an effort to burden Mainers with local-option taxes under the cloak of helping rural parts of the state.\This misguided and harmful change would force the hotels and restaurants to suffer yet another increase in the tax rate. Not all that long ago, such increases were to be temporary, and in even closer memory, this governor said there would be no new taxes. Yet Mainers eating and traveling within the state account for, respectively, 70 percent of meals consumed in Maine restaurants and over 30 percent of nights in Maine lodging establishments. At our family business, visitors still complain about the last increase.\And this effort to help rural Maine is deceptive. While 75 percent of the funds raised would be returned to the town or city that raises them, the other 25 percent would go to the Maine Rural Development Authority - but this funding can only be used for redevelopment of industrial and manufacturing sites. It is not a windfall to rural Maine.\Additionally, with towns like Ogunquit and cities like Portland already collecting millions in parking and cruise ship docking fees, this will only serve to create greater disparity in the ""have"" and ""have-not"" communities. Study after study on local-option taxes as far back as the 1970s has shown that such mismanagement of tax policy makes wealthy towns and cities wealthier and poor ones poorer.\Local-option tax, seasonal gas tax, increased lodging tax - what's next for visitors and residents? A local sales tax, too? Mainers expected something different from this legislative session, but they are just getting more of the same: taxes.\Allyson Cavaretta\York\Utility takeover would advance climate fight\The most important climate bill in the current legislative session doesn't even have the word ""climate"" in it. I write to urge Gov. Mills and our legislators to support L.D. 1646, An Act to Restore Local Ownership and Control of Maine's Power Delivery Systems.\There are many compelling reasons to support this bill, which would buy out Central Maine Power and Emera Maine and replace them with a consumer-owned utility: Ratepayer savings. Better customer service. Ensuring that our grid is managed with safety and efficiency, and not profit-making, as the ultimate goal.\I support L.D. 1646 for all of those reasons, but even more importantly because CMP has been a climate obstructionist in recent years, lobbying to narrowly defeat renewable-energy bills for three straight years from 2016 through 2018.\If we are going to truly make strides in decarbonizing the grid in the coming years, we need to take dinosaurs CMP and Emera out of the picture and replace them with a consumer-owned utility, represented by a variety of local stakeholders, that would see beyond its fiscal bottom line on every climate-related question.\Rob Levin\Portland\For proven leadership, elect Sheldon to council\Falmouth Town Council candidate Valentine Sheldon urged hundreds of residents recently to attend public meetings where a large majority spoke favoring a rollback of rezoning ordinances enacted in 2016, because of a lack of transparency and citizen input.\A show of hands at these meetings reflected an overwhelming desire to roll back the ordinances. Sheldon and others have been pushing for more input and communications from the council.\Significantly, no impact studies on the key issues of the environment, education costs, local economy and traffic were conducted in 2016 before the council's decision. As a result of the disastrous change of ordinances, many people were negatively impacted, leading to crowded lots, development of Airbnbs, etc. One local developer in 2016 urged the town to move in the direction of ""dense, urban-type"" growth.\There are five candidates for three seats. Vote for Valentine Sheldon on June 11: He's uniquely qualified, transparent, inclusive and one of two candidates not accepting political or vested contributions.\Victoria Murphy\Falmouth"
279," The lack of funding for wildlife management in Maine puts not only the welfare, but the very ""existence of the state's outdoor recreation heritage'' in danger for future generations, according to a draft of a legislative study released Tuesday.\ The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife's financial woes and its future mission were outlined in the report compiled by the Futures Committee, which was established by the Legislature two years ago.\ DIF&W Commissioner Lee Perry said the report is useful in helping to educate the Legislature and the public on the rough road the department faces, but whether the report's recommendations point the Legislature to a reasonable path to take is harder to say.\ ""It's helpful in that it puts this issue to the forefront,'' Perry said. ""I will be somewhat disappointed if [the Legislature] can't come up with some solution for the long-term needs as far as securing sources of funding, or a commitment to funding. Whether the exact way the report recommends is the right way, I think that will be something opened to debate and a lot of consideration.''\ However, unlike past reports on the DIF&W's financial status, Perry said this one considers the growing needs of the department.\ ""It's more forward-looking,'' Perry said. ""The message is that there needs to be a way of restoring funds to programs.''\ Officially called the Citizens Advisory Committee to Secure the Future of Maine's Fish and Wildlife, the study group found that wildlife in Maine is threatened not only by a lack of funding, but also by the loss of habitat, the presence of pollution and toxins in the environment, the pressure from recreation activities, the competition from exotic and invasive species, and the lack of public awareness of wildlife management needs.\ Attempts have been made before to sort out the DIF&W's financial problems. In the past 40 years, six different legislative-appointed committees came up with ways to help fund the department, according to DIF&W spokesman Mark Latti.\ The Futures Committee was formed primarily because the year 2002 will bring a new era of hardship to the department, Latti said.\ The surplus DIF&W normally is left with when it spends less than expected will not be available when new labor costs for employees go into effect in 2002, Latti said. The department's annual budget is currently a little more than $23 million.\ ""While the sources of funding have remained the same, primarily the licenses and the scope of responsibility have increased with the advent of recreational vehicles and the management of wildlife species,'' Latti said. ""The last license hike was in 1996. So unless something changes before 2002, that's when the shortfall is expected to begin.''\ Unlike other reports that only looked at additional sources of funding from areas such as licenses or migratory bird stamps, the Futures Report looked at non-traditional sources of funding to try to secure DIF&W's finances.\ Among the recommendations it:\ . That the Constitution of Maine be amended to require that at least percent of the state sales tax be dedicated to fish and wildlife programs in state agencies.\ . That the share of the gas tax revenues distributed for the operation of boating, ATV and snowmobile programs will be equal to the share of taxes devoted to DIF&W from watercraft and recreational vehicle gas sales.\ . That DIF&W continue to receive from the state funds in addition to those required by the Constitution to cover the cost for search- and-rescue operations required by law and the cost of collective bargaining agreement increases.\ . That complimentary licenses for seniors will be phased out and replaced with lifetime licenses.\ . That in 2004, hunting and fishing license fees will begin to be adjusted to reflect the cost of providing hunting and fishing services.\ Part of the reason to look beyond the department's traditional means of funding is the fact that the era of ecotourism has meant more people are benefiting from its work.\ A 1996 study by the University of Maine that stated that more than $1 billion in economic activity was generated by hunting, fishing and wildlife recreation also found that $331 million was brought in from wildlife watchers alone.\ To propagate the longevity of Maine's outdoor treasures, Perry said, the DIF&W particularly needs funding in its efforts to monitor various species and to dispense information on those species.\ ""That is shown in the controversy over lynx,'' Perry said. ""There are hundreds of species that, because of the recourses, we are not monitoring. And once the information is available, there is not the funding to protect the species. It's one of our bigger needs. ''\ Perry also pointed to the growing problem of land access for outdoor sports and recreation as another area that needs funding. He said the DIF&W's little-known program is run on a part-time basis and paid for by the money brought in by Super Sport Licenses.\ Sgt. Dave Peppard, who runs the Landowner Relations program, has said access is the No. 1 issue facing the outdoors public today.\ ""Private landowners are the most important element to outdoor recreation,'' Peppard said. ""Without them and the ability to access their property, opportunities to enjoy the outdoors would be severely restricted.''\ On the other hand, Perry said the fact the committee was made up of a diverse group of people will help to educate different interest groups about the DIFW troubles, even if it's too early to tell what affect the report will have.\ ""The issue has been of concern for some time,'' Perry said. ''It's good for people to recognize the problem exists. Whether the solution is the exact solution needs to be debated further. I don't think the way is important. So long as it has the public's support and the legislature's support.''\ Deirdre Fleming covers outdoor sports and recreation for the NEWS.

280,"Vote Willette\As a college student, I know that many people my age do not take a great interest in politics, especially local elections. I have reason to look forward to voting on Nov. 6, however, because of the great candidate running for re-election to the Maine House in my hometown.\State Rep. Alex Willette just finished his first term as Maine's youngest legislator, and he has given me hope for my generation with all of the things he has accomplished in just two years.\Willette has emerged as a leader in the House, someone who stands out and gets things done. It is thanks to him that we can all get home a little quicker after he increased the speed limit on I-95 from Old Town to Houlton. As a member of the transportation committee, he was instrumental in ending the automatic annual gas tax increases that would have been driving gas prices even higher than they are now. Willette has even helped tackle the growing drug abuse problem by getting tough on methamphetamine.\These are real accomplishments that help real people, regardless of how old you are or how much money you have. They are the results of true leadership, and that is why we need Willette in Augusta for another term. I encourage everyone in the Mapleton area to vote for\Willette for the State House.\Jason Johnson\Mapleton\State Senate vote\Thank you for the ""Your Ballot"" tool on your website. It was great to have info about candidates in one place. The answers by the candidates for my state Senate district (Albion, Benton, Clinton, Detroit, Pittsfield, Waterville and Winslow) were particularly helpful.\Democrat Colleen Lachowicz provided thoughtful responses to each of the questions, from health care to jobs to the state budget. Republican Tom Martin did not provide informative responses.\Lachowicz explained her reasoning for her beliefs. Martin just said, ""Yes, I support this"" or ""No, I do not support this.""\I appreciate that Lachowicz is willing to have a conversation with voters. She obviously cared about communicating her views and ideas on the issues. If Martin doesn't have the time or interest to answer questions, why should we send him to Augusta to represent us? I'll be voting for Lachowicz for state Senate.\Anneliese Monkman\Clinton\King of the Hill\Several years ago Angus King met with a small group of us in the cultural and humanities profession to talk about how creativity, innovation and critical thinking are essential ingredients tobuilding betters places to live in Maine. He referred specifically to the central role of the creative economy and quality of place in development. What I appreciated was hearing a successful entrepreneur and former governor underscore that many diverse elements in our society contribute to fostering prosperity.\It wasn't lip service; King gets it. This speaks to his U.S. Senate campaign positions on caring for the environment, stewarding Maine's sense of place and identity and promoting our inherent assets. King spans boundaries. He has the ability to see the bigger picture, know how to use its differing elements and remain anchored to the practical. That's why I'll be voting for him in November.\Sheila Jans\Madawaska\Supporting Jethro Pease\I am writing this letter of endorsement for Republican Jethro Pease, who is running for the Maine House of Representatives. I have known Pease for many years. First as a parent in the school that I work at, then as the fire chief in the Morrill Volunteer Fire Department.\As the past president of the MVFD, I worked closely with Pease. He was always a go-getter, bringing the standards of the fire department up to par with any of the other fire departments around. With his help, we were able to bring our town's rating up so that we now pay lower home-insurance rates. He was instrumental in getting us newer trucks and making sure that all of our volunteer firemen got the best training and equipment that we could afford. Under his leadership, the MVFD grew. He was always finding ways to help us be the best that we could be.\I believe that Pease is just what this state needs. He will go above and beyond for us, he will give it his all.\Caroline Dodd\Morrill\Proud of King\I have lived in Maine for 58 years. Throughout that time I have been proud to be represented in government by some of the finest public servants in America. Among them were Republicans, Democrats and independents. These women and men have advanced the interests of Maine citizens vigorously, and they have done so with integrity.\Furthermore, the integrity of their campaigns for office was not compromised by lies and distortions about their opponents. In the current election cycle, we are being exposed to flat-out lies and distortions by outside groups who seek to demean the integrity of former Gov. Angus King and to misrepresent his remarkable service as governor.\I beg my fellow citizens of Maine not to allow this outsider poison to infect our political life by smearing King's life and public service. He is one more of whom we should be proud.\Rev. Dr. Ansley Coe Throckmorton\Bangor\Marriage commitment\Cobscook Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) has undertaken prayerful discussion of marriage on a number of occasions. We have held up marriage and same-gender relationships for worship sharing and discussion during business meetings. We have listened to how Spirit speaks to us as Friends, and we are tender to the many paths we have taken to our present affirmations.\Cobscook Friends monthly meeting affirms that couples wishing to be married under our care are welcomed to do so within the faith and practices outlined by New England Yearly Meeting. We affirm that, regardless of gender, all couples desiring before God and our faith community to join in a mutually sustaining relationship should take up the full rights, benefits and obligations that flow from such a commitment.\Our message to the secular community is that society is strengthened when the privileges, rights and responsibilities of marriage are extended to same-gender couples, and that we are all weakened when equality is denied to some while being freely granted to others.\Janet Weston\Trescott Township"

The five candidates on the Nov. 2 ballot for governor tried to woo business leaders Thursday during separate forums in two regions critical to winning the November election.
\
Before hundreds of Chamber of Commerce members in Lewiston and Bangor, the candidates sparred about topics such as the state's business climate, budget deficit, job creation, health care costs and welfare.
\
With recent polls showing Republican Paul LePage and Democrat Libby Mitchell running neck and neck, independent Eliot Cutler cast himself as an alternative to both, while independents Shawn Moody and Kevin Scott said they were outsiders with needed business experience.
\
They first met early in the morning at the Ramada Conference Center in Lewiston for a breakfast and forum hosted by the Androscoggin County Chamber of Commerce and attended by more than 400 people.
\
Asked to rate the state's ""business climate"" on a scale of one to 10, from worst to best, independent Eliot Cutler started out by rating the climate ""about two."" Republican Paul LePage gave it ""about three""; independent Kevin Scott, ""two to three, maybe""; and independent Shawn Moody said, ""two to three.""
\
Democrat Libby Mitchell gave the state's business climate a five.
\
""A lot of it is how we see ourselves, and we need to create a culture of how to make businesses grow,"" said Mitchell, the Maine Senate president.
\
LePage, who is mayor of Waterville and general manager of the Marden's stores, said the key to helping businesses is to review and relax state regulations, while lowering the utility costs by looking ""at all forms of energy."" LePage also said he's not a politician or lobbyist, but rather a ""businessman who has served his community as mayor.""
\
In a swipe at Mitchell's assertion that Maine's economy has been hurt by a ""global recession,"" LePage pointed to Mitchell's three decades of service in the Legislature. ""We've been in a recession for 35 years; it's time we change direction,"" he said. ""What the people of Maine need is a governor who will govern for the people.""
\
Cutler also cited reducing energy costs, health care and changing government, while Scott said he would ""reach out to corporations"" to attract new businesses while ""cultivating an environment of professional business analysis.""
\
Moody said he'd work on a ""small-business stimulus package,"" while also focusing on lowering health care costs by attracting more insurance companies to the state.
\
Asked how they'd address a coming state budget deficit of at least $800 million, the candidates offered few specifics. LePage said the state could save ""hundreds of millions"" by reforming welfare, while Mitchell said about $250 million would be cut by not funding schools at the 55 percent level.
\
Cutler blasted the recent ""balanced"" state budgets as not being truly balanced because, he said, costs were shifted onto towns, schools and others, while borrowing has ballooned the state's debt.
\
""We need to stop digging the hole deeper, making promises, which is what my opponents are doing,"" Cutler said. He added, ""I never thought I'd be the only fiscal conservative in this race, but I am,"" which produced a chuckle from LePage.
\
Scott cast the other candidates as part of an establishment that has led the state to an economic ""train wreck,"" saying he represents the positive, innovative solution as someone who places engineers with technology firms.
\
""We've heard from the cheerleaders; I am a player and I play in the high-tech industry,"" Scott said.
\
Moody floated his proposal to turn the Department of Health and Human Services into the department of health and human ""resources,"" saying people in need of state assistance should be given ""a lifeline, not a lifestyle.""
\
Asked about welfare, Moody said the focus should be on getting welfare recipients back to work as soon as possible. He noted that he sees a lot of tall weeds as he drives on Maine's highways.
\
""Somebody could pull those out,"" he said.
\
Cutler said the state needs to end welfare's ""cliff"" effect, in which general assistance recipients aren't ""weaned"" off aid.
\
LePage proposed a five-year, lifetime limit to welfare so it's ""a transition, not a career."" Welfare recipients could be working at soup kitchens and hospitals, he said, and ""we need to get them working and off the couch.""
\
Scott, however, countered that 40 percent of the state's welfare recipients are also working, and that he instead would take a ""business analysis"" approach by examining people ages 18 to 45 and ""find out who's not working and why.""
\
None of the candidates committed to raising any specific taxes, though Cutler said an increase in the gas tax and more tolls should be considered to meet transportation needs. Mitchell said she would continue to pursue ways of lowering the state income tax, noting that voters rejected the Legislature's proposal to do that by expanding the sales tax to additional goods and services.
\
""It costs money to reduce this tax,"" Mitchell said.
\
On Thursday evening, the candidates met again to discuss business issues, this time before the Bangor Region Chamber of Commerce.
\
At Husson University's Gracie Theatre in Bangor, the candidates were asked to specify one tax they would cut if they could.
\
Mitchell, LePage and Cutler all said the income tax, while Scott said he would lower the property tax. Moody said it's just not realistic to talk about lowering taxes while the state continues to face significant budget problems.
\
""If we can hold the line on taxes, that would be a good goal in itself,"" he said.
\
Also on the issue of taxes, all pledged not to raise broad-based taxes while the economy is struggling and before the budget stabilizes. LePage even took it a step further, saying he also would not raise fees to balance the budget.
\
The Bangor chamber asked the candidates whether they would resort to shutdown days if they got into a battle with the Legislature.
\
""A state shutdown would be a total failure for any governor,"" Mitchell said. ""It's radioactive.""
\
LePage said he's worked with Democrats in Waterville, so he believes he knows how to handle members of the opposition party. While saying shutdown days would not be his ""preferred way to operate,"" he wouldn't rule them out either.
\
""I am never going to say never when it comes to shutdown,"" he said.
\
The debate started on a political note, when Cutler called on voters to consider voting for the best person, not against another candidate.
\
""I know some of you are concerned about Paul becoming governor, so you want to vote for Libby to keep him from becoming governor,"" Cutler said as he noted that some also fear Mitchell so they are voting for LePage.
\
That prompted a response from Mitchell.
\
""Who will you vote for if you're afraid of Eliot?"" she said as Scott raised his hand.

\
The five candidates on the Nov. 2 ballot for governor tried to woo business leaders Thursday during separate forums in two regions critical to winning the November election.
\
Before hundreds of Chamber of Commerce members in Lewiston and Bangor, the candidates sparred about topics such as the state's business climate, budget deficit, job creation, health care costs and welfare.
\
With recent polls showing Republican Paul LePage and Democrat Libby Mitchell running neck and neck, independent Eliot Cutler cast himself as an alternative to both, while independents Shawn Moody and Kevin Scott said they were outsiders with needed business experience.
\
They first met early in the morning at the Ramada Conference Center in Lewiston for a breakfast and forum hosted by the Androscoggin County Chamber of Commerce and attended by more than 400 people.
\
Asked to rate the state's ""business climate"" on a scale of one to 10, from worst to best, independent Eliot Cutler started out by rating the climate ""about two."" Republican Paul LePage gave it ""about three""; independent Kevin Scott, ""two to three, maybe""; and independent Shawn Moody said, ""two to three.""
\
Democrat Libby Mitchell gave the state's business climate a five.
\
""A lot of it is how we see ourselves, and we need to create a culture of how to make businesses grow,"" said Mitchell, the Maine Senate president.
\
LePage, who is mayor of Waterville and general manager of the Marden's stores, said the key to helping businesses is to review and relax state regulations, while lowering the utility costs by looking ""at all forms of energy."" LePage also said he's not a politician or lobbyist, but rather a ""businessman who has served his community as mayor.""
\
In a swipe at Mitchell's assertion that Maine's economy has been hurt by a ""global recession,"" LePage pointed to Mitchell's three decades of service in the Legislature. ""We've been in a recession for 35 years; it's time we change direction,"" he said. ""What the people of Maine need is a governor who will govern for the people.""
\
Cutler also cited reducing energy costs, health care and changing government, while Scott said he would ""reach out to corporations"" to attract new businesses while ""cultivating an environment of professional business analysis.""
\
Moody said he'd wprk on a ""small-business stimulus package,"" while also focusing on lowering health care costs by attracting more insurance companies to the state.
\
Asked how they'd address a coming state budget deficit of at least $800 million, the candidates offered few specifics. LePage said the state could save ""hundreds of millions"" by reforming welfare, while Mitchell said about $250 million would be cut by not funding schools at the 55 percent level.
\
Cutler blasted the recent ""balanced"" state budgets as not being truly balanced because, he said, costs were shifted onto towns, schools and others, while borrowing has ballooned the state's debt.
\
""We need to stop digging the hole deeper, making promises, which is what my opponents are doing,"" Cutler said. He added, ""I never thought I'd be the only fiscal conservative in this race, but I am,"" which produced a chuckle from LePage.
\
Scott cast the other candidates as part of an establishment that has led the state to an economic ""train wreck,"" saying he represents the positive, innovative solution as someone who places engineers with technology firms.
\
""We've heard from the cheerleaders; I am a player and I play in the high-tech industry,"" Scott said.
\
Moody floated his proposal to turn the Department of Health and Human Services into the department of health and human ""resources,"" saying people in need of state assistance should be given ""a lifeline, not a lifestyle.""
\
Asked about welfare, Moody said the focus should be on getting welfare recipients back to work as soon as possible. He noted that he sees a lot of tall weeds as he drives on Maine's highways.
\
""Somebody could pull those out,"" he said.
\

283,"The arrest of Carlos Rafael in New Bedford sends a stark message to NOAA, our congressional delegation and everyone who cares about the future of fishing: It is time to make the full-fleet monitoring of commercial fishing boats a priority so we know what is happening on our oceans. \Currently, NOAA has no monitors aboard boats at a time when the New England cod fishery is in the midst of a historic collapse. That means right now we do not know what fishermen are catching and selling, or throwing back into the sea. The switch to more cost-effective electronic monitoring would not only end the widespread distrust of NOAA's scientific assessments, but it would increase confidence among fishermen that everyone is playing by the same rules. \Funding is available now to get electronic monitoring up and running. It's imperative that scientists, fishermen and regulators know what is happening at sea in this era of climate change, and that starts with full-fleet electronic monitoring. \Joshua Wiersma, Ph.D, Northeast Fisheries Manager, Environmental Defense Fund Boston \Don't discount lives saved when talking gun safety \Maryann Larson's Feb. 23 letter said studies have shown that we are safer without guns. \Try telling that to the hundreds of innocent children who died at Columbine, Newtown, the movie theater in Colorado and all the other massacre sites. How many hundreds of them could have been saved by one honest person with a gun? According to one study, someone with a gun saves someone's life or stops a crime from happening 2.5 million times a year in America. \What her letter didn't say is that every study that came to the conclusion that guns are dangerous has already been proven to be either junk science or outright lies. The World Health Organization has said there are 110 other countries more violent than America and everyone of them has banned the private ownership of guns. \One of the problems is people with phobias about guns try to cure their phobias by getting all guns banned everywhere. They want America to be one big gun-free zone. But you can not cure phobias with legislation. Phobias require treatment. Putting us in more danger with their gun free zones that have already been proven to be death traps is not going to cure their phobias about guns. \Instead of making the world more dangerous, tell the anti-gun nuts to seek treatment for their irrational phobias. \Thomas O'Connor Falmouth \High school students show true sportsmanship \February break was a bust for many of us - little snow on the mountains and snowmobile trails as well as weak ice on the lakes. \What to do that is both exciting and invigorating? Go watch some Maine high school basketball tournament games. \I had the pleasure to go to a number of games these last few weeks and I would like to take a moment to commend our high school athletes, their coaches and their communities. \High school students learn such valuable skills when they participate in various teams and much of what they learn has nothing to do with rather or not they can shoot from the three-point line or defend under the hoop. \Instead, as the Maine Principals Association so clearly outlines, our students learn that ""the purpose of activities in school programs is to develop and promote the physical, mental, moral, social, and emotional well-being of individual participants."" \As I was leaving the Expo or the Cross Center after various games, it was nice to see the respectful way our athletes and community members engaged with each other. Emotions can run high after a game, but overwhelmingly, communities understand that our school programs are successful when they create a positive environment for all. \Congratulations to all of the teams who have played with such passion and skill throughout this winter sports season. \Julie Blodgett Cumberland \Republicans should respect the office of the president \I saw a video that showed U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., throwing President Obama's proposal to close Guantanamo Bay in the trash. The U.S. Senate vows not to confirm the president's nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States. \These are the same people who claim love for the military. In the military, you don't have to like an officer, but you must respect his office. \The Republican Party would do well to respect the office of the president of the United States. What goes around comes around with amazing accuracy. \Tom Muradian Winslow \LePage wrong to say locals don't support national park \I can not and will not stand idly by while Governor LePage repeatedly claims that the only people who support the proposal for a new national park or monument in Maine are ""rich, out-of-state liberals and people from the Portland area."" This is a lie and a disrespectful one at that. \I am from Millinocket, and I support the proposal for a new national in the Katahdin region because I am dedicated to ensuring my hometown has a bright future. \The Katahdin region saw a lot of changes recently. As a small-business owner, I am not immune to the changes. \As more and more people have left Millinocket, I have had to lower my fees to attract customers. \I need more customers. This business is 23 years in practice and barely sustainable. A national park will bring more people to Millinocket. \Despite the changes to my community, one thing has remained the same: the natural resources that surround us. We need to capitalize on tourism and outdoor recreation. \A national park will help us do that. It will undoubtedly attract more people to this beautiful part of the state, which is good for me and my neighbors. \I can only hope that Sens. King and Collins can see past our governor's lies and look ahead to a proposal with guaranteed potential for economic growth. \Robin A. Burgess small business owner Millinocket \Distrust of government doesn't solve any problems \In your Feb. 28 Insight section, one commentary lends support to another. Cynthia Dill correctly observes: ""After years of hearing from members of Congress and the tea party and angry conservative pundits like Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin that government is very, very bad, the electorate is convinced."" \Now jump to Frank Green's Another View guest editorial asserting that we shouldn't raise the gas tax to repair Maine's crumbling infrastructure because, once enacted, the tax might become permanent (like deteriorating infrastructure isn't?) and because he doesn't trust politicians in Augusta not to ""raid"" the new funds for other purposes. \Frank Green has so little trust in our politicians in Augusta that he's using this as his justification to argue that we should do nothing! Apparently in his mind our government is so broken, we shouldn't even try to utilize it to solve any of our problems - even obvious ones that hinder economic growth (and that only government can address), such as crumbling roads and bridges. Sad, very sad. \The tea party and angry conservatives have done our country a great disservice. \Andy Wright Cumberland Foreside"
284," Construction equipment worth millions of dollars sits idle in the storage yard of CPM Constructors, one of the five major bridge construction firms in Maine.\ The state has run out of money for bridge and highway maintenance projects, and there's not enough work to keep the Freeport company busy. The company has only 50 workers now, a third of its usual work force at this time of year, explained president Eldon Morrison.\ ""Look at all these trucks,"" he said, pointing to a row of parked fuel trucks, water trucks, pickup trucks and rack trucks. ""Each one represents one job.""\ Morrison and others in the highway construction industry see hope on the horizon: the Legislature's decision last week to support the largest transportation bond package in the state's history. It would spend about $110 million for highways and bridges over a two-year period, a figure that increases to $291 million when the federal and local match is added.\ For the driving public, the issue is about balancing the need for safe and efficient highways with funding for other needs, such as schools and health care. For the state's manufacturers and retailers, highways are a critical piece of the economic infrastructure, allowing them to move products to market.\ But for the companies that are in the business of engineering, repairing and building highways and bridges, the size of the transportation bond has more immediate implications: It determines their profit levels and the size of their work force.\ About 5,600 Mainers are involved in road construction, with another 43,000 engaged in the business of moving goods and people on roads. That's one out of every 12 workers in the state.\ These are good-paying jobs. Construction jobs start at nearly $12 an hour, and the average wage is $18 an hour. Crane operators can make more than $30 an hour, and supervisors earn as much as $90,000 a year.\ Moreover, every job in the transportation sector supports at least one other job in another part of the economy, said Laurie Lachance, an economist who is president of the Maine Development Foundation.\ ""It's really important that we invest in this foundational piece of the economy,"" she said.\ Under last week's legislation, voters would be asked in June to approve the $110 million for highways and bridges, as well as several million dollars for other transportation projects involving rail, ports and public transportation.\ Separate ballot questions that call for investing in a range of public-policy initiatives also were approved by the Legislature as part of last week's package. They would go to voters in June, November and June of 2008, bringing the total in bond requests to $295 million.\ The last time voters approved a transportation bond package was 2005. That was for $33 million - just a fraction of what voters had authorized in previous years. Between 1997 and 1999, for example, voters had approved three transportation bonds totaling $153 million.\ As a result, there hasn't been enough work to keep road construction and asphalt companies going at their normal pace. Some, like CPM, have gone to New Hampshire and Vermont to find work.\ Don Paradis, who is a 58-year-old crane operator for CPM Constructors, said he collected unemployment benefits this winter for the first time in his 20-year career.\ ""It's been a struggle,"" he said.\ As many as 1,000 workers have lost their jobs over the past couple of years, according to John O'Dea of the Associated Constructors of Maine.\ Industry officials say the issue is bigger than their economic self-interest. Many road and bridge construction companies have lost expertise and capacity during this recent dry period, so ramping up to take on this work will cost additional tax money, said Tom Gorrill of Gorrill-Palmer Consulting Engineers Inc.\ The people who work in the industry are specialists. When they leave, they go to other industries and don't come back, said Jim Hanley, quality control manager for Pike Industries, which runs 14 asphalt plants in Maine. Hanley said his company's workload this year is about 40 percent blow average.\ ""Gearing back up is slow, arduous and very expensive,"" he said.\ For a more efficient use of tax dollars, Gorrill said, the state should develop a long-range plan for road and bridge maintenance to provide consistent funding levels year-to-year.\ ""This is the hard way to do this,"" he said. ""We can't be doing this in fits and starts.""\ The industry this year heavily lobbied the Legislature to support a substantial transportation bond. Although the size of this bond package is unprecedented, it still falls short of what is needed to maintain the state's 23,000 miles of public roads and streets and 3,000 bridges, according to industry officials.\ Because of double-digit inflation in the cost of construction materials in recent years, dollars spent on road projects don't go nearly as far as they used to, they said. Moreover, because the federal gas tax - at 18.3 cents for every gallon purchased - is not adjusted for inflation, the buying power of those revenues declines each year. The federal government pays as much as 80 percent of the cost of some state road projects.\ The trend toward more fuel-efficient cars, while good for the environment, also puts a crimp in budgets because the cars generate lower revenues for each mile traveled.\ Many of the state's highways and bridges were built during the Eisenhower administration, but there is not as much financial effort in maintaining them as there was building them, Gorrill said.\ A third of the state's bridges are expected to reach the end their useful lives in the next 10 to 20 years, but there is no plan for replacing them.\ A study by the Maine Economic Growth Council, a quasi-state agency charged with developing a long-range economic plan for the state, found that nearly a third of the state's major roads are in poor or mediocre condition.\ That's why people in the road construction business are expressing mixed feelings about the bond package.\ ""It's been a pretty dry spell for the last several years, and this does give us some hope,"" said Herb Sargent of the Sargent Corp., an earth-moving company with offices in Stillwater. ""But it's really a Band-Aid at best.""\ ""The problem we have is the long term,"" said Scott Leach, district manager of The Lane Construction Corp., a Connecticut- based highway and bridge contractor that has an office in Bangor.\ ""We have neglected putting money into the highway infrastructure for so long that we are getting ourselves into a hole,"" he said. ""It's going to take a long time to dig out of that.""\ Staff writer Tom Bell can be reached at 791-6369 or at:\ tbell@pressherald.com"
285,"The state of Maine could not float a $50 million transportation bond this week because traders told officials there was ""no market"" at all for large financial transactions such as this one.\The state hopes the national financial crisis will stabilize by next week, when it again tries to access capital, probably getting a higher interest rate than had been expected.\""In 34 years I have never had a trader say, 'I can't give you a sale price. There is no market,' "" said Maine Municipal Bond Bank Executive Director Robert Lenna, describing his efforts to sell the bond on Wall Street.\A week ago, Lenna said, the interest rate for the AA-rated revenue bond would have been about 3.8 percent or 3.9 percent. But on Tuesday, short-term interest rates, a factor used to calculate interest rates for municipal bonds, soared as high as 9 percent and 10 percent, effectively shutting down market activity.\""If there is any place the (national financial) crisis is affecting the citizens of Maine, it is here,"" Maine Treasurer David Lemoine said Wednesday.\The board of directors for the Maine Municipal Bond Bank voted Wednesday to sit out this period of turmoil in financial markets and try to sell the transportation bond sometime before Nov. 15 at a rate no higher than 5.5 percent. Even at that rate, the bond would cost taxpayers millions of dollars in extra interest payments over the life of the loan than might have been expected a week ago.\Lemoine said Thursday that the state's bond bank representatives made the right move by delaying.\""Congratulations on stepping back from the plate and having the courage to do that,"" he told Lenna at the bond bank's monthly board meeting Wednesday.\There were no immediate repercussions from failing to sell the bond this week because the state Department of Transportation did not need the funds immediately. However, there will be consequences if the market turmoil lingers, Lemoine said.\The $50 million TransCap bond is meant to pay for 10 highway reconstruction projects involving more than 20 miles of road in eight counties. It is part of a larger transportation package approved by the Legislature last session that includes $160 million in bonds earmarked for bridges. Those bonds are scheduled to be put on the market in annual $40 million issues, from 2009 through 2012.\Lemoine said the jobs associated with the 10 transportation projects covered by the $50 million bond could be jeopardized if the markets don't recover. As a rule of thumb, about 34 jobs are created for every $1 million in transportation funds, meaning that up to 1,700 jobs could be affected.\""If this problem is not fixed, then you can look at the list of projects and the jobs that they would have created and say that is not going to happen,"" Lemoine said Thursday.\Lenna said the ""frozen, distorted"" bond market is particularly surprising because municipal bonds are considered very stable, with a default rate of less than 1 percent. But that perceived stability has been knocked out of kilter by the financial crisis. ""It's like this poison has been introduced into the financial circulatory system,"" he said.\""(The bond market) is where governments and towns and counties go to borrow the money that lets them build schools and build sewer plants and pave roads and do all of that infrastructure that needs constant maintenance,"" Lenna said. ""If this market were to contract substantially, if investors decide it is not as secure as they thought it was or they thought there are other places to put their money, the impact on our ability to get money to build schools and hospitals and all of this stuff would be affected. ""It's a big deal. It's a really big deal,"" Lenna said.\In addition to re-floating the TransCap bond, the Maine Municipal Bond Bank is looking to re-enter the market next week for its semi-annual bond sale, with a $99 million bond representing local projects for more than 20 municipalities. Lenna said he hopes the market will have settled down by then.\Maine's situation is not unique, said Susan Gaffney, an executive with the Government Financial Officers Association, a nationwide trade association.\""We're hearing from many state and local entities that they are having problems with pricing and accessing the market,"" she said, noting that most are also choosing to delay activity until the market stabilizes. ""This is a problem with liquidity and not a problem with municipal securities as a product.""\If anything, Maine is in a better position than most, since it has a limited number of bonds in play. Some major cities have daily activity in the market. ""You are in better shape to wait and let the market recalibrate,"" Gaffney said.\The TransCap bond sale delay will not hurt the 10 transportation projects, state transportation officials said. One of the projects, to repave a section of Route 4 in Sandy River Plantation, is already under way, and a second project, to repair a section of Route 1 in downtown Kittery, has been put out to bid.\""Right now, we're fine. We're funding (the work) with money from elsewhere,"" said Mark Latti, spokesman for the Maine DOT. ""Now, if things continue and we're unable to sell the bond by the end of the year, it would pose some challenges. It would mean those projects would be delayed.""\Revenue to repay the TransCap bond will come from five sources, including 7.5 percent of annual receipts from the state gas tax, currently at 28.4 cents per gallon for gas and 29.6 cents for diesel. But gas consumption is down, eating into that revenue.\Other sources of TransCap revenue are $10 from each $25 vanity license plate fee and $10 from each $33 vehicle registration fee. Last month, Maine DOT announced it was suspending work on about 85 miles of road, a little more than 10 percent of the work planned for the year, because of rising asphalt prices.\""It's a difficult environment,"" Latti said. ""All state agencies are experiencing difficult times, and it's a balancing act between available funding and available contractors. We're really in extraordinary times.""\Staff Writer Noel K.

\
AUGUSTA -- Gov. James B. Longley told lawmakers he hoped he'd be more mature and wiser in his second year in office.
\
Gov. John McKernan admitted to learning a lot in his first year as chief executive.
\
Gov. Angus King declared that ""we are living in revolutionary times.""
\
From 1976 through 2004, five Maine governors have addressed lawmakers to recount the accomplishments of their first year and to set the agenda for the second. Some used humor; others talked about world and national events. All of them promised to make Maine a more vibrant state.
\
Gov. Paul LePage will deliver his first State of the State address at 7 p.m. today in the House chamber. With his tendency to go off-script and an eye toward an ambitious agenda, LePage will command center stage with his evening address.
\
Highlights from his predecessors show a variety of approaches as unique as the men who delivered the speeches.
\
Gov. James B. Longley, Jan. 19, 1976
\
Longley, the state's first independent governor, began his speech with a blunt assessment of himself.
\
""I hope I am a more mature, wiser governor than when I assumed office a year ago,"" he said.
\
Longley, first elected in 1974, was speaking to a Democratic House and a Republican Senate. He said what may have seemed like controversy in his first year were efforts by both parties and an independent governor to figure out how best to work together.
\
Longley was propelled to statewide significance in the early 1970s when he served as chairman of a cost-cutting commission. He continued to talk about the size and cost of government throughout his speech. Much of what he said more than 30 years ago is reminiscent of recent speeches by LePage.
\
""We must stop holding out false hopes and stop building dreams that turn into further nightmares,"" he said. ""We must stop misleading people into believing that government can give more than it takes.""
\
He left the Legislature with four goals, including a call to create a ""corporation of Maine people"" to emphasize the need for fiscal responsibility and to avoid increasing taxes. He also called for a fix to the school funding formula and wanted a raise for state workers.
\
""Finally, I would hope that you would agree with me that it is deceitful to lead people to believe government can be all things to all people; because when we try to be all things to all people, we end up being less things to most people,"" he said.
\
Gov. Joseph E. Brennan, Jan. 2, 1980
\
Brennan, a Democrat, began his speech with a global perspective -- and a call for a better decade ahead.
\
""We have survived a decade devastated by Vietnam, Watergate and, more recently, the insatiable greed of the OPEC nations, a decade that has drained the public's confidence and its institutions, a decade when many lost faith in our national purpose, and a decade in which our collective pride has been diminished,"" he said.
\
Brennan, who was attorney general and a legislator before being elected governor, then laid out four major policy areas he wanted to address.
\
First was agriculture. Brennan said he wanted to establish a state policy of preserving land, create a department to help farmers with financing and allocate $300,000 to promote industrial development.
\
Second, he called for continued energy conservation and set a goal of ""weatherization of every Maine home during the course of the next 10 years.""
\
Third, he called for bills to protect the environment, including a board to oversee pesticide use.

""We in Maine are fond of pointing to our magnificent wilderness, our clean air, pure water and blue skies as our greatest attractions,"" he said. ""But, as you know, the sad truth is that in some parts of Maine, for decades the air has not been so clean, the water has not been so pure and the sky has not been so blue.""

Fourth, he proposed the creation of the Department of Corrections and proposed to spend $1.5 million to improve to state prisons.
\
John R. McKernan Jr., Jan. 12, 1988
\
""I've learned much in the past year, and I've been reminded that the mark of a truly educated man is that he can talk for hours on any subject ... and doesn't,"" McKernan said at the beginning of his speech.
\
McKernan, a Republican, talked about his efforts to continue to meet with citizens through his Capitol for a Day program, which LePage revived last year. McKernan said he saw signs of ""growth and prosperity"" in southern Maine but noted that other parts of the state were seeing plant closings, layoffs or strikes.
\
His first goal for the new year focused on child care. He proposed a $3.5 million child care initiative.
\
""In 1988, we must realize that child care is everyone's business,"" he said. ""It is a family concern -- an oftentimes emotional and difficult one.""
\
He also promised additional money to lower property taxes, funds for at-home care for the elderly, a retraining program for displaced workers, a comprehensive program to address AIDS, and welfare reform.
\
""It is a proposal that views welfare not as a dead end but as a road to independence,"" he said.
\
His plan required those who receive welfare to agree to go back to school or participate in a job training program. Because of reduced federal funding, McKernan proposed a 5 cent increase in the gas tax to pay for road improvements.
\
""We still have distances to cover, and barriers to overcome, but in 1988, we are in a position to achieve new heights for Maine and its people,"" he said.
\
Angus S. King Jr., Jan. 23, 1996
\
King, the state's second independent governor, started his first State of the State address with a bold statement.
\
""We are living in revolutionary times,"" he said. ""I believe that we are in the middle of the greatest change in the way people work and organize their lives since the Industrial Revolution. The revolution I speak of is the globalization of the economy.""
\
King said Maine was well positioned to take advantage of the new economy, but that competition would be fierce. He wanted to focus on education as the key to the state's future prosperity.
\
""The days when a strong back was all you needed to get a good job are long gone, and more and more over the next dozen years decisions about where companies locate and grow will depend upon the quality of local education,"" he said.
\
To that end, King said, he wanted better educational standards, money to train teachers, consolidation of administrative functions, and Internet access in all schools.
\
To promote business growth, King launched the Plus One campaign, which encouraged each existing Maine business to add one employee. He said the Department of Environmental Protection would allow businesses to come forward if they have a violation without fearing retaliation from the state.
\
King ended his speech by saying that politics in Maine, when compared to the national stage, were like ""Ozzie and Harriet.""
\
""We're sometimes opponents but never enemies,"" he said. ""We differ on the means but rarely the ends; and we're grateful to you, the people of Maine, for giving us this extraordinary opportunity.""
\
John E. Baldacci, Jan. 20, 2004
\
Just eight years ago, Baldacci, a Democrat, promised to make Maine the envy of all other states by expanding King's laptop program to high schools and letting parents use the technology.
\
""Maine is poised to develop an entire generation with one of the most marketable skills in the world,"" he said. ""In the process, we're becoming the envy of every other state in the nation.""
\
He expressed hope that the new year would bring more jobs, but said the state's high tax burden continued to be a problem.
\
He also announced a goal of raising Maine's high school-to-college rate from 55 percent to 70 percent by the end of the decade.
\
""This will take Maine from the middle of the pack to among the best in the nation in college attainment,"" he said.
\
Baldacci ended his speech with a tribute to the men and women in the military serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. He announced a new tax form checkoff to create a relief fund for families of National Guard members and reservists who are on active duty.
\
""Providing for the common good, making people feel secure in their communities and homes, this is the central job of government,"" he said. ""It's why all of us are here serving our state and our people.""

From 1976 through 2004, five Maine governors have addressed lawmakers to recount the accomplishments of their first year and to set the agenda for the second. Some used humor; others talked about world and national events. All of them promised to make Maine a more vibrant state.
\
Gov. Paul LePage will deliver his first State of the State address at 7 tonight in the House chamber. With his tendency to go off-script and an eye toward an ambitious agenda, LePage will command center stage with his evening address.
\
Highlights from his predecessors show a variety of approaches as unique as the men who delivered the speeches.

Jan. 19, 1976
\
Longley, the state's first independent governor, began his speech with a blunt assessment of himself.
\
""I hope I am a more mature, wiser governor than when I assumed office a year ago,"" he said.
\
Longley, first elected in 1974, was speaking to a Democratic House and a Republican Senate. He said what may have seemed like controversy in his first year were efforts by both parties and an independent governor to figure out how best to work together.
\
Longley was propelled to statewide significance in the early 1970s when he served as chairman of a cost-cutting commission. He continued to talk about the size and cost of government throughout his speech. Much of what he said more than 30 years ago is reminiscent of recent speeches by LePage.

""We have survived a decade devastated by Vietnam, Watergate and, more recently, the insatiable greed of the OPEC nations, a decade that has drained the public's confidence and its institutions, a decade when many lost faith in our national purpose, and a decade in which our collective pride has been diminished,"" he said.
\
Brennan, who was attorney general and a legislator before being elected governor, then laid out four major policy areas he wanted to address.
\
First was agriculture. Brennan said he wanted to establish a state policy of preserving land, create a department to help farmers with financing and allocate $300,000 to promote industrial development.
\
Second, he called for continued energy conservation and set a goal of ""weatherization of every Maine home during the course of the next 10 years.""
\
Third, he called for bills to protect the environment, including a board to oversee pesticide use.

289,"As expected, Gov. Paul LePage has vetoed a bill dealing with net metering for solar energy.\AUGUSTA -- As expected, Gov. Paul LePage has vetoed a solar energy bill strongly supported by environmental groups and solar installation companies. \The bill, L.D. 1504, would direct the Maine Public Utilities Commission to adopt new rules that would keep so-called ""net metering"" solar energy incentives but reduce them over time. Supporters proposed the bill after the PUC voted earlier this year to phase out net metering - also known as net energy billing - in which homeowners with solar energy panels receive credit for 100 percent of the full retail value of excess electricity they feed back into the power grid. \But in his veto letter, LePage repeated his contention that net metering ""subsidizes the cost of solar panels at the expense of the elderly and poor who can least afford it."" Supporters, who will need to maintain the two-thirds majorities they had in both chambers to override the veto, countered by accusing LePage of blatantly misrepresenting the bill's intentions in order to turn Republican votes. \""It is a very cynical attempt to flip more Republican votes by lying to them,"" said Steve Hinchman, legal counsel for ReVision Energy, the largest solar installation company in Maine. \Solar policy has been a major issue in Maine since last session, when LePage successfully vetoed a net metering bill that had divided the industry. \After multiple changes, the current version of the bill that passed the Legislature late last month would reduce that credit to 90 percent for new customers applying between Dec. 31, 2017, and Dec. 31, 2018, and then to 80 percent the next year. The bill also would allow the PUC to further reduce the credit amount for future net metering customers, but customers could keep receiving credits for up to 15 years. The legislation would also require the PUC to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the policy. \An outspoken critic of net metering, LePage contended in his veto letter that L.D. 1504 continues the ""unsustainable practice"" of net metering. \""Even the Natural Resources Council of Maine has acknowledged that net energy billing 'is not a preferred long-term policy,' "" LePage wrote. ""However, rather than moving away from this practice to a more sustainable approach, L.D. 1504 sets net energy billing into statute in perpetuity."" \He also said that the bill contains ""serious drafting errors that will result in irrational outcomes,"" such as solar customers seeing their power bills drop even if they don't generate any electricity. \Not so, according to ReVision Energy's Hinchman. The language in the current bill, he said, mirrors the existing PUC language on net metering. The only change, he said, is that it would allow the ""step-down"" of compensation rates to apply to the excess electricity being sold back into the grid. \""That is the governor's attempt to mislead legislators,"" Hinchman said. ""It is flat-out not true."" \LePage's veto of the bill sets the stage for what could be another close vote on solar energy in the Maine House. The current bill passed the House on a 105-40 vote and the Senate by a vote of 29-6, which are both veto-proof margins. But LePage has successfully vetoed even bills that passed unanimously in both chambers thanks, in large part, to his ability to flip enough Republican votes in the Democratic-controlled House. The Legislature has scheduled a veto session for July 20. \Last year, the House upheld a LePage veto of a much more sweeping solar bill by just a few votes, thereby setting in motion the controversial PUC decision to begin phasing out net metering. \Beth Ahearn, political director of the organization Maine Conservation Voters, said LePage was ""wiping away bipartisan progress for the second year in a row"" on solar energy issues. \""The governor's actions could threaten good-paying solar jobs, our environment, and our climate future,"" Ahearn said in a statement. ""This veto is bad for Maine, and goes against the majority of Maine people who have made their support for solar power known for over two years. We are calling on our state legislators to stand with the Maine people who want to see our great state move forward and benefit from solar power by voting to override the governor's veto of the solar bill.""

290,"Solar power installers have never been busier in Maine. \They're covering roofs at dozens of homes. They're putting up high-profile commercial projects, such as the Maine Beer Co. brewery on Route 1 in Freeport, which features 212 panels with two ""tracker"" arrays that follow the sun to maximize output. In April, a developer announced plans to build the state's largest solar project. It would feature 9,500 panels at an abandoned naval facility in Gouldsboro and sell power to The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor. \But all the activity, which echoes a national solar boom, masks the fact that solar energy is at a crossroads in Maine. Despite strong public interest, political support is eroding at a crucial time, making growth here uncertain in the near term. \Solar's stellar rise is being subsidized by a 30 percent federal tax credit that has been essential to consumer affordability. The credit is set to expire for homeowners at the end of 2016, and drop to 10 percent for utilities and businesses. Congress could renew or modify the program, but the industry is pessimistic about winning a tax subsidy with divided government in a presidential election year. \If the solar investment tax credit goes away, the impact will be keenly felt in Maine. \Maine is the only New England state lacking a clear policy to promote solar development. Clean energy advocates were excited last winter when a handful of bills aimed at providing financial incentives for solar were introduced in the Legislature. But their hopes were largely dashed by opposition from Gov. Paul LePage and ideological differences between Republicans and Democrats. \One bill that would have offered a modest rebate for farmers who installed solar was carried over until next year. Although it was approved in the Legislature, supporters calculated that it didn't have enough votes to survive an expected veto from LePage. \A far-reaching solar bill, championed by Rep. Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, the assistant House majority leader, was reduced to a study process of alternative ways to compensate solar generation, known as net metering. That study process, called a resolve, is expected to be vetoed by LePage and will face an override vote when the Legislature reconvenes Tuesday. Assuming the veto is overridden, that process will get underway this summer at the Maine Public Utilities Commission. It will include the Maine Office of the Public Advocate, lawmakers, solar installers, clean-energy advocates and utilities. They'll try to reach a consensus the Legislature can consider next year. \In an interview last week, Gideon said she's not discouraged by the outcome. Finding an alternative to net metering, she said, is crucial to the long-term growth of the solar industry, and the concepts being discussed in Maine are drawing national attention. \""We are setting ourselves up for the next generation,"" she said. \The fate of Gideon's bill, however, may doom the Gouldsboro solar project. The $9 million venture would have generated enough power for 500 or so average homes. But financing hinged on an element in the bill that would have required electricity suppliers to include new solar generation in their power portfolios. ""I'm not sure whether the project is doable without the (solar renewable energy credits) but I'm continuing to explore alternatives,"" Kim Kenway, president of Gouldsboro Solar LLC, said last week. \'UNCERTAINTY ON THE HORIZON' \Nationally, solar electricity is still less than 1 percent of total generation, but it accounted for nearly one-third of new capacity during the first six months of last year, trailing only natural gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Falling panel prices are contributing to the trend, putting solar power on par with coal and gas. \In Maine, however, doubts about the federal tax credit and the future of net metering, and Le- Page's hostility toward subsidies for renewable energy, have solar installers pondering their business plans. One strategy is to expand elsewhere. \""We're trying to respond to a strong marketplace demand,"" said Phil Coupe, co-founder of the state's largest solar company, ReVision Energy in Portland. ""But there's uncertainty on the horizon, between the tax credit and net metering, and we're reluctant to buy more trucks and hire employees. If we had a stable environment, we could double our business in the next 24 months."" \Coupe has 60 workers in Maine. He said he's backed up 10 weeks on installation jobs. \The lack of support in Maine has ReVision expanding in New Hampshire, which offers a rebate up to $3,750 on top of the federal credit. The company has an office there with 40 workers. \One of Maine's oldest solar installers, Talmage Solar Engineering in Arundel, is using its proximity to the border to work in other states. It installed a 9,562-panel array in Sharon, Vermont, that generates enough power for 440 homes. The project is valued for taxes at $4.2 million by the town and benefits from a state law encouraging long-term contracts for solar power. \""I am having to leave Maine,"" said Naoto Inoue, the company's president. ""I don't do much in Maine. Maine happens to have the worst incentives in New England."" \MINI-SURGE UNDERWAY \Maine's ambivalence toward solar is reflected in related economic activity. \Perhaps not surprising, California leads the nation in solar industry jobs, with 54,700 workers, according to The Solar Foundation. But the second-place state might be unexpected - Massachusetts, with 9,400 jobs at 353 companies. Maine ranks 43rd, with 400 jobs at 43 companies. \Nationally, companies are racing to finance and build projects before the federal tax credit expires. Much of the effort involves giant installations in the West, notably in California and Texas. \A mini-surge is underway in Maine, where a marketing campaign called Solarize Freeport has 39 homes signed up. The Solarize concept started six years ago in Oregon. In Freeport, the community discount for bulk purchase is worth about $800 for each home. Coupled with the 30 percent tax credit, it knocks more than $5,000 from a typical $15,000 installation, if participants sign up by Sept. 30. \""Every morning I wake up and think about January 1, 2017,"" said Vaughan Woodruff, owner of Insource Renewables in Pittsfield. ""Next year is going to be a total seller's market. People are going to be calling off the hook and we're going to be able to pick projects because we can't do them all."" \Woodruff has seven employees and said his business could double in size to handle the workload. Much of his work is in Freeport and southern Maine, where there are more affluent homeowners. He'd like to stay closer to home and says the solar incentives could have created business in rural Maine. Ideally, he said, he'd train laid-off paper millworkers as solar installers. \Woodruff's view is echoed by Rob Taisey, co-owner of Assured Solar Energy in North Yarmouth. He's working with Solarize Freeport and installed the Maine Beer Co. array, as part of an earlier contract. \""It's a shame,"" he said. ""While (the Legislature) has been fiddling for the last three years, Mainers are losing out on the ability to leverage a lot of private capital to improve the economy.""

294,"
HALLOWELL -- Despite the gray overcast of a mid-December day, a coalition of advocates, who say state regulators need to do more to embrace and promote solar energy rallied outside the Maine Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday.
\
""Maine needs solar jobs,"" the group of about 50 people chanted at one point during their rally.
\
Moments earlier, inside the PUC, commission members, along with a broad panel of individuals representing solar energy stakeholders, including homeowners, environmental groups, solar panel installation firms, power companies and utility ratepayers were reviewing policy proposals aimed at helping the state reach its clean-energy goals and grow jobs in the process.
\
As a result of a legislative resolve passed into law earlier this year, the PUC, along with Maine's Public Advocate Timothy Schneider, have been working with the diverse group to recast state energy policy in ways that could have an impact on how those who generate excess solar power are compensated when they send that juice back to the grid.
\
A practice, known as net metering, requires power companies such as Central Maine Power to credit those who generate solar electricity at a rate of one kilowatt for every extra kilowatt they send to the grid.
\
In many cases, this system, which also allows homeowners to use the energy they generate when they need it, is fueling solar installations across the country.
\
But power companies are leery as they absorb more and more costs for metering, monitoring and banking energy credits for homeowners while the explosion of more locally generated electricity is undermining the financial model on which expensive expansions of power transmission lines are designed.
\
As more homeowners install solar energy and improve efficiencies, the demand for energy provided via that transmission infrastructure logically declines.
\
One change could be a system that sees solar generators lose some of those credits in exchange for a fixed rate for the power they generate over the long term.
\
And while some see a change in the system as inevitable, others are concerned that homeowners and businesses will begin to shy away from installing solar if incentives are eroded to the point they no longer make financial sense.
\
Kurt Penney, a solar roof systems business development specialist with the Lewiston-based Industrial Roofing Companies, said most of the companies' solar work is in Massachusetts, where he is based.
\
And while growth is surging, Maine has largely lagged behind the rest of New England when it comes to installing solar panels for businesses and homes, Penney said.
\
He said Maine's solar industry needs to and can catch up if the PUC and the state Legislature can set thoughtful policies.
\
As of Dec. 31, 2014, Maine, last in New England, had about 11 megawatts of installed solar power capacity. Massachusetts, a national leader by comparison, had more than 660 megawatts. Maine has a goal of 255 megawatts of installed solar capacity by 2021.
\
""I hope that Maine will recognize the importance of this technology,"" Penney said during the rally, which was organized by the Natural Resources Council of Maine and the Maine Chapter of the Sierra Club.
\
""We are here to tell you that this industry is real -- we can reduce costs, we can make this attractive to commercial business owners and we hope to tie together our roofing and solar skills to make this truly a practical and economic, as well as environmental, choice for business owners in Maine,"" Penney said.
\
Penney later said the state must create a regulatory environment that is not only supportive of solar and other types of renewable energy but also a stable and dependable one so homeowners and businesses can trust that their investments in clean energy will pay off -- or at a minimum, will help pay for themselves.
\
He also said the power companies must stop seeing those who generate solar energy as a threat to their business models and start to see them as what he describes as ""channel partners.""
\
""We should be considered as an opportunity so that we don't have to spend so much money on utility upgrades,"" Penney said.
\
Environmental advocates, including those with the Sierra Club and the NRCM, note that the installation of clean energy, along with increased energy efficiencies, help in reducing the demand on fossil fuels and carbon emissions.
\
Those advocates said that retooling the way solar producers are compensated with net metering systems should be a careful and deliberate move.
\
""We want there to be an incentive for people to build solar, but we also want to fairly recognize the value of solar, and that's the same thing,"" said Dylan Voorhees, the clean energy project director for NRCM. ""People use different labels to describe that, but we actually want people to be paid a fair way for what solar is worth and that creates an incentive for people to invest in solar.""
\
Jason Keyes, a California-based attorney with The Alliance for Solar Choice, a national organization that advocates for solar energy, said the policy of net metering should not be dismantled because it's proven to work in growing solar investment. Keyes, who was a participant in the solar stakeholders group in Maine, said net metering should remain one of multiple options that businesses and homeowners have when they decide to become solar producers and consumers.
\
According to Keyes, Maine should first work to set up sound policies to support large-scale solar developments and leave net metering as it pertains to homeowners as it is for the time being.
\
""They should focus on those because those are meeting market segments that aren't being met now,"" Keyes said. ""They can come back to the residential market two to three years from now and (look at alternatives).""
\
The alliance noted in a release issued Wednesday that more than 2,700 Mainers have signed a petition urging the Maine PUC to keep net metering for homeowners as it is and to enhance it with alternatives.
\
And while the PUC may be able to make some changes to the programs aimed at solar producers and consumers, any large changes to Maine energy policy would likely first be subject to legislative debate.

"
295,"The country's two largest installers of rooftop solar panels fought along side Maine politicians who oppose financial incentives for the industry to defeat a landmark solar bill in the Legislature.\The Maine lawmakers who last month defeated a landmark bill that would have expanded solar energy had unusual allies: national companies that are the country's largest installers of rooftop solar panels. \The companies, led by California-based Sunrun Inc. and SolarCity, hired lobbyists to fight the bill, donated money to political action committees that benefit the bill's opponents and used social media to push an alternative measure that created a smokescreen for the bill's detractors. \The conflict between national solar companies and their Maine counterparts reflects deep divisions over how to credit the homeowners and small businesses for the power they generate on rooftops and in backyards. \Those credits are seen as essential to the expansion of solar power because they provide a payback for the upfront investments in solar equipment. A solar system can cost $15,000 to $18,000 for a typical Maine home, with a payback period of up to 12 years after a 30 percent federal tax credit, depending on electricity prices. \But the credit system, known in the industry as net metering, is also politically unpopular - especially with Gov. Paul LePage - because it is seen as a subsidy, funded by all utility customers, that increases the price of electricity. \In the end, LePage vetoed the measure and the Legislature failed to override the veto by two votes. \Assistant House Majority Leader Sara Gideon, a Freeport Democrat who was the principal champion of the bill, said national solar company support for a Republican effort to amend the bill - which the bill's supporters rejected - created confusion around an already complex piece of legislation. \""Instead of fighting a lobbying effort with one opponent,"" she said, ""now there were multiple opponents, and one was the solar industry itself. That's hard to overcome. It creates confusion and was the final nail in the coffin, when you come down to a two-vote margin."" \SOUGHT TO PROTECT NET METERING \The Maine solar bill would have replaced net metering with an innovative but untested alternative credit system that was crafted by a coalition of local solar installers, top Democrats, the state's public advocate, utility companies and the state's clean-energy and conservation groups. \But the national solar installers, committed to the net metering system, didn't like Maine's alternative proposal. They were afraid it would catch on in other states where net metering is also under fire, so they came to Augusta to fight it. \""If Maine had abandoned net metering (for an alternative) it would have been unprecedented in New England and across the country,"" said Suzanne Merkelson, a spokeswoman for SolarCity. ""We just wanted to protect net metering, at all costs."" \Although the solar bill was defeated, the conflict over compensation for utility customers who generate power with small solar systems isn't over. It's moving now to a new battleground: the Public Utilities Commission. \Under an existing Maine law, the PUC must review net metering once the amount of energy generated by the sun hits 1 percent of total power generation. That threshold was crossed on a hot day last summer in Central Maine Power's service area. \The PUC is expected to announce its review plan soon, and the national solar installers will once again be fully engaged in the process. \But their strategy is a gamble. The three PUC commissioners were appointed by LePage. Democrats and clean-energy advocates fear the panel will modify net metering in ways that will stunt the growth of solar power and the 400 jobs it now provides for local installers. \THE 'NEXT METERING' ALTERNATIVE \The number of Mainers with solar arrays on their rooftops or in their yards is still relatively small - about 1,900 homes and 200 small businesses or institutions in CMP's service area in southern and central Maine. \Customers who own those systems are getting a one-to-one credit on their electric bills at the so-called retail rate, the total of power supply, distribution and transmission costs. Maintaining this retail rate is the definition of net metering. \The failed solar bill would have replaced the current form of net metering with an untested alternative that supporters dubbed ""next metering."" Utilities would have bought the solar power in combined, long-term contracts at rates that would have decreased over time as prices fell and solar penetration grew. This idea had drawn national interest, as a possible model for updating net-metering policies. \That was a threat to the national installers, SolarCity and Sunrun, the lead member of The Alliance for Solar Choice, a trade group made up of roughly 15 big installers and the country's chief advocate for rooftop solar. \Chris Rauscher, public policy director for Sunrun, said he worked with all sides to try to craft a bill that also maintained net metering in its current form, but he was unsuccessful in persuading lawmakers to embrace a side-by-side pilot program. He said the failed solar bill would have given excessive control to utilities and created uncertainty in the market over time. \""So now we will need the (PUC) to step in and ensure the full value of solar net metering to Maine's economy is recognized,"" Rauscher said. \A POTENTIAL NATIONAL MODEL \Merkelson, the SolarCity spokeswoman, said Maine's solar bill would have hurt rooftop customers in the long run. It would have favored larger-scale projects and given utilities too much control of solar. That's why Central Maine Power and Emera Maine embraced it, she said, and why the utility industry saw Maine's bill as a potential national model. \SolarCity hired Steve Hudson, a lobbyist and partner at the Preti Flaherty law firm. Hudson declined to discuss his role, although he acknowledged making a minor addition to a letter to Senate Republicans from Ken Fletcher, a former Republican lawmaker and LePage's first energy director.

National companies take chance on PUC with net metering
\
The Maine lawmakers who last month defeated a landmark bill that would have expanded solar energy had unusual allies: national companies that are the country's largest installers of rooftop solar panels.
\
The companies, led by California-based Sunrun Inc. and Solar City, hired lobbyists to fight the bill, donated money to political action committees that benefit the bill's opponents and used social media to push an alternative measure that created a smokescreen for the bill's detractors.
\
The conflict between national solar companies and their Maine counterparts reflects deep divisions over how to credit the homeowners and small businesses for the power they generate on rooftops and in backyards.
\
Those credits are seen as essential to the expansion of solar power because they provide a payback for the upfront investments in solar equipment. A solar system can cost $15,000 to $18,000 for a typical Maine home, with a payback period of up to 12 years after a 30 percent federal tax credit, depending on electricity prices.
\
But the credit system, known in the industry as net metering, is also politically unpopular -- especially with Gov. Paul LePage -- because it is seen as a subsidy, funded by all utility customers, that increases the price of electricity.
\
In the end, LePage vetoed the measure and the Legislature failed to override the veto by two votes.
\
Assistant House Majority Leader Sara Gideon, a Freeport Democrat who was the bill's principal champion, said national solar company support for a Republican effort to amend the bill -- which the bill's supporters rejected -- created confusion around an already complex piece of legislation.
\
""Instead of fighting a lobbying effort with one opponent,"" she said, ""now there were multiple opponents, and one was the solar industry itself. That's hard to overcome. It creates confusion and was the final nail in the coffin, when you come down to a two-vote margin.""
\
The Maine solar bill would have replaced net metering with an innovative but untested alternative credit system that was crafted by a coalition of local solar installers, top Democrats, the state's public advocate, utility companies and the state's clean-energy and conservation groups.
\
But the national solar installers, committed to the net metering system, didn't like Maine's alternative proposal. They were afraid it would catch on in other states where net metering is also under fire, so they came to Augusta to fight it.
\
""If Maine had abandoned net metering (for an alternative), it would have been unprecedented in New England and across the country,"" said Suzanne Merkelson, a spokeswoman for SolarCity. ""We just wanted to protect net metering, at all costs.""
\
Although the solar bill was defeated, the conflict over compensation for utility customers who generate power with small solar systems isn't over. It's moving now to a new battleground: the Public Utilities Commission.
\
Under an existing Maine law, the PUC must review net metering once the amount of energy generated by the sun hits 1 percent of total power generation. That threshold was crossed on a hot day last summer in Central Maine Power's service area.
\
The PUC is expected to announce its review plan soon, and the national solar installers once again will be fully engaged in the process.
\
But their strategy is a gamble. The three PUC commissioners were appointed by LePage. Democrats and clean-energy advocates fear the panel will modify net metering in ways that will stunt the growth of solar power and the 400 jobs it now provides for local installers.
\
The number of Mainers with solar arrays on their rooftops or in their yards is still relatively small -- about 1,900 homes and 200 small businesses or institutions in CMP's service area in southern and central Maine.
\
Customers who own those systems are getting a one-to-one credit on their electric bills at the so-called retail rate, the total of power supply, distribution and transmission costs. Maintaining this retail rate is the definition of net metering.
\
The failed solar bill would have replaced the current form of net metering with an untested alternative that supporters dubbed ""next metering."" Utilities would have bought the solar power in combined, long-term contracts at rates that would have decreased over time as prices fell and solar penetration grew. This idea had drawn national interest as a possible model for updating net-metering policies.
\
That was a threat to the national installers, Solar City and Sunrun, the lead member of The Alliance for Solar Choice, a trade group made up of roughly 15 big installers and the country's chief advocate for rooftop solar.
\
Chris Rauscher, public policy director for Sunrun, said he worked with all sides to try to craft a bill that also maintained net metering in its current form, but he was unsuccessful in persuading lawmakers to embrace a side-by-side pilot program. He said the failed solar bill would have given excessive control to utilities and created uncertainty in the market over time.
\
""So now we will need the (PUC) to step in and ensure the full value of solar net metering to Maine's economy is recognized,"" Rauscher said.
\
Merkelson, the Solar City spokeswoman, said Maine's solar bill would have hurt rooftop customers in the long run. It would have favored larger-scale projects and given utilities too much control of solar. That's why CMP and Emera Maine embraced it, she said, and why the utility industry saw Maine's bill as a potential national model.
\
SolarCity hired Steve Hudson, a lobbyist and partner at the Preti Flaherty law firm. Hudson declined to discuss his role, although he acknowledged making a minor addition to a letter to Senate Republicans from Ken Fletcher, a former Republican lawmaker and LePage's first energy director. The letter detailed the high cost ratepayers would endure if the bill passed.
\
The bill that finally was voted on by lawmakers contained compromises developed with the help of two Republicans on the Legislature's Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee. But LePage sought additional, last-minute concessions, including a request to slash the rate solar customers get for net metering in half over 18 months.

"
298,"At least 2,000 Maine homeowners have sunk thousands of dollars into solar power arrays. Part of their calculation in making the purchase is the ability to sell excess power back to the grid, called net metering.\That means their electricity meters can reverse during times when their system generates more power than they use at home. The power companies pay them for it, and the savings help solar customers recover the cost of the equipment faster.\It's only fair that they get paid something for their power, right? But the question is how much.\Maine's now taking on a debate playing out across the country over how to value that power, how to adapt the simplistic incentive of net metering to a maturing market, and whether it's fair to change the game on existing customers.\(For the basics on net metering, and how it affects everyone's power bill, read this.)\The stakes for solar in Maine are small, but growing.\A report issued last week by Environment Maine shows that solar capacity in Maine lags much of the country and the region. But it's clear that the industry's momentum is at stake.\According to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Maine's small-scale solar capacity rose 63 percent in the last year, compared with about 42 percent across New England. Only Rhode Island had a lower estimate of small solar capacity, at about 11 megawatts, to Maine's 16.1 megawatts.\Maine outpaced the region and country for the amount of solar it generated in the past year, although the state's relatively low capacity makes it easier to grow quickly.\After a law to replace net metering with new incentives failed, solar installers say keeping net metering is crucial to maintaining that growth.\Some say net metering customers are paid too little.\One study, updated last week, showed that a solar installation generating power for 25 years would deliver a value of 27.2 cents per kilowatt-hour back to the grid. That includes all of the avoided costs of building transmission lines and the environmental benefits of reducing emissions.\Maine solar installer ReVision Energy argued that net metered solar customers are actually getting paid too little, with residential customers getting around 13 cents per kilowatt-hour and small commercial customers getting less than 12 cents per kilowatt-hour.\In comments to the PUC, ReVision Energy wrote that net metering ""is not perfect, but it provides ' rough justice'"" for the value small solar generators provide to the grid.\[documentcloud url=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2997908-Revision-Energy-NEB-Comments/annotations/310411.html""]\Others argue that net metering customers are paid too much.\Prices for solar installations continue to fall, but they still cost the typical homeowner more than $15,000. Not everyone can afford that.\The Dirigo Electric Cooperative criticized net metering as ""a reverse Robin Hood program, taking from those who cannot afford self-generation to give to those who can,"" in a 2008 case cited in comments by the Governor's Energy Office.\Central Maine Power Co., in its comments, advanced the idea, writing that the commission's review of net metering should ""address the inappropriate subsidization between net energy billing customers and other utility customers.""\And the Maine Public Advocate's Office has argued that state and federal solar policy largely limits the benefits to landowners with high federal tax liability. In other words, the well-to-do.\The federal tax credit for solar installations does not come to taxpayers as a cash rebate, but instead discounts any existing tax liability. The Public Advocate's Office wrote that then ""requires that customers have sufficient tax liability to realize this benefit.""\""If all customers bear the costs of the program, all customers should have the opportunity to participate and obtain those benefits,"" the Public Advocate wrote.\There's no way for renters to benefit from net metered systems either.\But the solar industry and others argue that doesn't mean net metering should go away for the relatively small group that has it now and counted on it to help recover their investment in the equipment.\Net metering customers worry that what happened in Vegas won't stay in Vegas.\In Nevada, things got heated when regulators changed the rates of about 17,000 solar customers who had installed the photovoltaic systems.\The case rankled entrepreneur Elon Musk's SolarCity and installer SunRun, leading to a lawsuit, a November ballot initiative and calls for a special session of the legislature.\The fate for existing customers poses a lingering question in Maine as well. National and local solar installers want customers to be grandfathered into current net metering rates ""in perpetuity.""\But utilities and the Governor's Energy Office have argued those customers should eventually transition away from their current arrangements, being grandfathered for no more than three years.\That prompted sharp criticism from Assistant House Majority Leader Sara Gideon of Freeport, who called the governor's suggestion a ""reckless, ill-conceived plan."" Gideon sponsored a solar policy bill last session that proposed a successor to net metering and would have grandfathered existing customers for 12 years.\The Office of the Public Advocate, which represents ratepayers, suggested grandfathering current net metering customers for 10 years from the start of the operation of their solar systems.\CMP and Emera Maine said they were not opposed to grandfathering current customers, with CMP suggesting that around 10 years would be appropriate for customers to get a payback on their initial investment.\Environmental advocates echoed the solar industry, arguing that current customers should keep their net billing arrangements for the life of their existing solar installations.\""In the event that changes are proposed, it would be massively disruptive, legally questionable and virtually unprecedented to change net metering rules for existing customers,"" the Conservation Law Foundation wrote.\Now the issue is in the hands of regulators.\Public Advocate Tim Schneider led a compromise last year among utilities, solar installers, his office and others to give small solar generators access to long-term contracts. The proposal promised to keep solar adoption on track for growth projected under net metering, while introducing some market dynamics into the pricing.\The system would have set up a ""standard buyer"" for solar power -- likely the utilities -- that would solicit bids and could enter long-term contracts with certain solar generators, grouped by size. The utilities would aggregate renewable energy credits for each megawatt those customers generated, selling that into the regional cap-and-trade program and using those proceeds to defray costs for all electricity customers.\That plan's failure landed the solar policy back in the laps of regulators. They will now play referee and consider whether they, without the Legislature, can or should dust off the compromise plan and enact it themselves.\Credit: Darren Fishell BDN Staff"

Advocates want to keep net metering; opponents say deal unfair
\
Clean-energy advocates in Maine are seeking a path forward to save a controversial financial incentive for rooftop solar panels, following an election that may make it harder to overcome opposition from Gov. Paul LePage.
\
Generating power at home has broad public interest in Maine, for reasons that range from cutting electric costs to fighting climate change. Installing solar panels also creates jobs, and could bring economic activity to rural areas hit by factory closures. But LePage and others say solar homeowners are receiving a subsidy from the majority of electric customers who don't have panels, and question why the industry still needs financial support when equipment prices have fallen sharply.
\
These opposing views have created a political divide that couldn't be bridged in the last Legislature, and will face similar or even steeper challenges next year.
\
The divisions in Maine are happening against a national backdrop in which President-elect Donald Trump has spoken out against renewable energy and expressed support for fossil fuel industries.
\
Despite that, the solar industry is cautiously optimistic that the existing federal 30 percent investment tax credit for solar panels -- which Congress voted in 2015 to fully extend for five more years -- will stay in place. That's because the solar extension was part of a bipartisan bargain which lifted a 40-year ban on crude oil exports.
\
Beyond that, some Trump-leaning states are embracing solar energy. The power grid operator in Texas, for instance, is projecting that the bulk of the state's new generation over the next 15 years will come from solar.
\
Assuming the tax credit remains stable, the next-biggest incentive for solar is state-sponsored financial arrangements in which homeowners are compensated for the full retail price of generating power. The practice is called net energy billing or net metering. So what happens in Augusta over the next several months is considered crucial to the near-term growth of solar in Maine.
\
Last spring, a wide-ranging solar energy bill that was the product of a yearlong study and negotiations among stakeholders failed to become law. Supporters fell two votes short of overriding a veto from LePage, who relied on Republican allies in the House of Representatives to kill the measure.
\
This winter, a new Legislature will convene with a House in which Democrats maintain a slim majority, but where Republicans have picked up three more seats.
\
Meanwhile, the Maine Public Utilities Commission has proposed changes to the net metering rule that would gradually reduce financial incentives over 10 years. Existing customers would continue to receive the full incentives, but only for 15 years.
\
The commission held a public hearing on its proposal in October. Residents who attended overwhelmingly opposed the rule changes. More than 300 interested parties filed written comments, many expressing views similar to this letter from Donna Busch, a resident of Union.
\
""I am writing to express my disappointment concerning the PUC draft changes to roll back solar net metering starting 1 Jan. 2017. Through net metering, thousands of homes, including ours, are able to produce their own solar power. Maine should be in the forefront of installing and using solar power to support local energy production, not lagging behind the rest of the region and the world. ... Please leave net metering alone and allow the Legislature to institute a broad solar policy to benefit Maine's economy, solar producers, and our precious environment -- one of the greatest assets of this state.""
\
The PUC plans to make a final decision by year's end.
\
Solar supporters are waiting to see the final PUC ruling. Whatever happens, Democrats plan to introduce at least one solar bill next year, although the specifics are still being refined. If, in their view, the PUC diminishes net metering's current incentives, they will propose a law aimed at restoring the benefits.
\
To succeed, Democrats will have to convince enough Republicans that net metering in its current form is good for all ratepayers, and to override an expected veto from LePage.
\
""I don't have a head count for Republican legislators who would vote for solar,"" said Rep. Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, who will be speaker of the House next session. ""But why be in lock-step with the governor in his last two years? There's no advantage of doing that.""
\
Gideon said she plans to introduce at least one solar bill. Beyond preserving net metering, other proposals may pick up on last year's efforts to craft new incentives to replace net metering while maintaining similar benefits for homeowners, as well as boosting solar in other sectors, such as commercial buildings.
\
LePage's position will be championed in the Legislature by Rep. Ken Fredette, R-Newport, who has been re-elected House minority leader. Asked if he supports the PUC's proposal, or would agree to keeping net metering as it is, Fredette offered a limited response.
\
""We have a lot of work to do this session and we look forward to having a positive conversation about solar,"" he said.
\
Net metering is a decades-old rule that requires utilities to credit the bills of homeowners with roof-top solar panels for the full retail price of all the electricity they send into the grid. Those credits help homeowners recover the costs of solar-electric panels, which can average $10,000 or so. The credits continue to be paid as long as power is generated.
\
Net-metering was set up in the 1980s to help jump-start solar when the technology was new. But panel costs have fallen sharply in recent years, and utilities and some policymakers, including LePage, say it's time to trim the incentive. As solar's popularity grows, they say, the credits are shifting the cost of serving homes with solar panels onto other customers.
\
Solar supporters dispute this point of view, and say net metering isn't a subsidy. They say the value of this energy actually is greater than its cost. That debate is going on in states across the country, as utility regulators try to agree on how to value the power produced by thousands of homes.
\
In Maine, solar supporters know they need to focus their efforts on House Republicans. Vaughan Woodruff, owner of Insource Renewables in Pittsfield, said he will again try to convince lawmakers that some of the layoffs at shuttered paper mills can be replaced with solar-installer jobs.
\
""This election showed the gap between urban and rural voters,"" said Woodruff, who built a successful solar business in central Maine. ""We have to make the case for what solar can do for our small communities.""
\
Dylan Voorhees, clean energy director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said a survey his group did earlier this year found 61 percent of Mainers want lawmakers to enact strong solar policies. The PUC's proposal fails to do that, he said. Voorhees said the makeup of the incoming Legislature presents an opportunity to change some minds, especially with a solar bill that isn't as complex and far-reaching as what was proposed last session.
\
""We were only two votes short,"" he said. ""That's really close.""
\
Moderate Republicans, then, may hold the key to the future of net metering.
\
Sen. David Woodsome, R-Waterboro, said he thinks the level of compensation for homeowners should be reduced, but he still wants to encourage people to install rooftop panels.
\
""I don't have a solution, but I'd like to see something worked out,"" he said.
\
Woodsome has been co-chairman of the legislative committee that handles energy issues and is likely to retain that position next year. D
\
uring the debate last spring on the comprehensive solar bill, he and a Republican House member from rural Maine worked together to find a way to keep the measure alive.
\
""We came close,"" Woodsome said. ""Maybe something like that can happen again.""

300,"Cancel classes during stormy weather\I agree with with Lance Lajoie's March 25 Bangor Daily News letter to the editor criticizing the University of Maine for its reluctance to not cancel classes during inclement weather, and I want to take the idea a step further.\The university runs a transport van for disabled students. On stormy days, UMaine cancels the operation of the van so that no one gets hurt if there is a crash. The students that rely on that van must then find their own way to the classes (since the school has not canceled classes) and sometimes get to the classroom only to find that the professor has canceled the class (because they did not want to jeopardize their own life getting to the university for work).\What is the sense in this? This policy needs to be scrutinized and clarified so that everyone is safe.\Deb Mansell\Hampden\I-395 connector questions unanswered\I am opposed to the Interstate 395-Route 9 connector. Shortly after I addressed the March 25 Bangor Area Comprehensive Transportation System meeting, Scott Rollins of the Maine Department of Transportation claimed what we've heard is not true. Deputy Commissioner Jon Nass pointed to several books, saying the project has been thoroughly vetted. One of them contains 67 pages of my own questions to the 2012 draft environmental impact statement, the majority of which the Department of Transportation considered not substantive, neatly packaged and unanswered.\That's what these people do: control the conversation by dissimulation. Maybe it's time the public demands real answers as our tax dollars drive these events. As of February 2015, $2.8 million had been spent on this study and the cost to construct the 2B2 route is $61 million.\I have asked the following question of many state and federal officials and no one has answered. FOAA documents of emails starting on Dec. 16, 2011, indicate that the Federal Highway Administration study co-manager advised his Maine Department of Transportation counterpart that because of criteria changes, the preferred alternative, the 2B2, does not satisfy the purpose and need and moving forward with the analysis is now an apples-to-oranges comparison. We would learn two years later that the Federal Highway Administration study co-manager was overruled by his superiors. The administration needs to explain why they allowed this study to continue and why they suppressed such serious concerns from their own transportation professional.\This has been and continues to be an unethical process locking out private citizens and their municipal leaders.\Larry Adams\Brewer\Keep solar regulations simple\Net metering for residential solar power producers is a great practice that benefits both the homeowners with solar panels on their roofs and electric utility companies. The homeowner benefits by being able to ""bank"" electricity credits during our long summer days to use during our short winter days while paying a fee to the utility for distribution of the electricity. The utility company benefits from net metering almost twice what it costs them, according to Maine Public Utility Commission analysis.\LD 1649, under consideration in the Legislature, proposes to grandfather existing solar net metering contracts. That is one of the many good features of the bill. But the bill as it is written now will deny net metering to new residential solar producers. Instead of net metering, LD 1649 proposes having new residential producers sell their electricity to the utilities then buy it back. That is fine for businesses, but let's keep it simple for homeowners who want to produce enough solar electricity for their use with perhaps some to spare.\Our legislators should support LD 1649 and make the changes necessary so net metering is available not only for those of us who already have a few solar panels on our roofs or in our yards but also for new residential solar producers.\Jill Martel\Dedham\Rockland should revise zoning rules\Rockland's City Council held a planning meeting March 24 to propose regulations to protect the city against companies building power plants, such as the proposed natural gas-fired plant, that could hurt our people, our environment and our community's ability to grow and prosper.\One serious omission in the plan was zoning restrictions on where power plants, even on a small scale, could be located. The plan calls for prohibiting these facilities from zones A and AA only. Without tighter zoning restrictions, developments such as Bartlett's Woods Retirement Community, which is zoned B, could have a noisy, intrusive, possibly polluting plant constructed right next door. And the most bizarre part is this plant could belong to a company located miles away, which just found it convenient or cheaper to locate it in someone else's backyard. Imagine the disastrous effect on property values this ordinance would cause.\The ordinance would also damage the character and potential for growth for the entire city by allowing such lax zoning regulations. Who would want to invest in property in a city when there were no assurances that power plants could become their next-door neighbor? No one.\Zoning laws exist to to protect people and the communities in which they invest and live. They assure us that our investments are safe and our communities remain livable. Let's make sure the City Council continues to offer those assurances by revising this zoning proposal.\Randle Christian\Rockland\Second Amendment not obsolete\I am writing in response to Steve Perrin claiming in a March 21 BDN letter to the editor that the Second Amendment is now obsolete because the times have changed and so have guns. He also claims to know that the ratifiers of the Bill of Rights did not have today's guns in mind when they wrote it.\He is not the first person to ask this question and probably not the last, but I never see any call for an overhaul or abandonment of the First Amendment because of today's communications systems. I also doubt very much that Perrin wrote his letter with a quill and inkwell. The world has modernized, but the Constitution still is needed and useful.\If somebody is breaking into your house in the night, would you rather have a gun in your bedstand or a cellphone and wait 10 to 30 minutes for help to arrive?\Merle Cousins\Southwest Harbor"

Augusta City Council meets Thursday to discuss a propsal to use methane from the landfill for electricity. The initial cost would be close to $400,000 but landfill officials say it will quickly pay for itself in the electricity cost savings. Also, the heavy equipment needed to run the solid waste facility and recycling center demands a more robust energy source. LATE
\
Proposal to use methane would rely on net metering
\
AUGUSTA -- City councilors reacted favorably Thursday to a proposal to invest $375,000 to bring three-phase electrical power to the Hatch Hill landfill, which could allow the city to make electricity using methane gas produced by rotting garbage.
\
While using methane gas already being produced and captured at the landfill to produce electricity would require roughly $2 million in additional investment beyond adding three-phase power, that investment, city administrators and a consultant say, could be paid back, and then some, in savings in the city's electricity bills.
\
However, that payback would rely on controversial net metering rules, which could be changed by the state Public Utilities Commission. Under net metering, utilities credit the bills of small energy generators for the full retail price of all the electricity they send into the grid.
\
The city proposal would rely on net metering provisions that would allow the city to get about 8.5 cents per kilowatt hour in credits it could use to pay electricity bills at some of the city and schools' biggest energy-using buildings, such as the Augusta Civic Center and Cony High School. And it would cost an estimated 6 cents per kilowatt hour to generate that electricity at Hatch Hill, using methane from the landfill to power generators that would produce electricity.
\
The PUC is considering changes that could make net metering less beneficial to small power producers, which the city would be.
\
However, Richard Silkman, a founder and partner of Competitive Energy Services, an energy services consultant working for the city on the proposal, said the curvrently proposed new rules before the PUC still would allow the city to pay for the energy project and bring the city savings beyond the investment payback.
\
""Net metering arrangements are essential to this kind of project, because there is (little demand for electricity) at the landfill; so whatever you generate there, you've got to bring it somewhere to be used,"" Silkman said. ""Should those rules, or law, change at some point, then you'd have to re-evaluate. But we think there is value, to the city, in savings to be realized.""
\
Ralph St. Pierre, finance director and assistant city manager, said if the city gets a system up and running and then the net metering rules change, he anticipates the city would be grandfathered, and would be allowed to continue getting a credit for its electricity produced by the system under the rules in place at the time the system went online. He said that has been the PUC standard practice previously.
\
But before the city could build a system to generate power at Hatch Hill, three-phase power needs to be in place.
\
And having three-phase power would have other benefits at Hatch Hill, Public Works Director Lesley Jones said, by allowing heavy equipment there to run more efficiently and reliably.
\
But perhaps the most intriguing benefit of having that higher-grade form of electricity at Hatch Hill landfill is that it could allow the city to move forward with the proposal to build a system to use methane gas produced as mountains of garbage at the landfill decompose, to produce electricity that would be fed into the electrical grid and reduce the city's electricity costs.
\
The city already captures, and burns off with a flare, methane gas produced at the landfill to prevent it from escaping into the environment and harming it.
\
City Manager William Bridgeo said a recently completed engineering report by Competitive Energy Services confirmed city staff's previous assessment that the city could generate enough electricity at Hatch Hill for the potential project to return a positive payback on the city's investment.
\
But three-phase power would be needed at Hatch Hill to handle the new system, and the landfill has only singe-phase power, which comes via a line through the woods from Route 3 installed in the 1960s, according to Jones.
\
Bridgeo and Jones said even if the city never moves forward with a proposal to build a facility to convert methane to electricity, having three-phase power at Hatch Hill would have benefits.
\
Jones said several pieces of equipment at Hatch Hill should operate on three-phase power, such as recycling balers and leachate pumps. Without access to it, the city instead uses converters and variable frequency drives to run that equipment, but she said doing so makes it less efficient and shortens the life span of the motors.
\
Bringing three-phase power to the site would cost about $375,000, which Bridgeo said could come out of the Hatch Hill enterprise fund, with no effect on the city's property tax rate. Jones said Bob LaBreck, the city facilities manager, has been working with CMP on a proposal to bring three-phase power to Hatch Hill from South Belfast Avenue, which would be less costly than bringing it from Route 3.
\
Jones said three-phase power also would be more reliable, resulting in fewer power outages at the landfill.
\
While the current landfill is projected to be full in 12 to 15 years, the facility, Bridgeo and Jones said, probably still will be used as a disposal site, where three-phase power would be needed. And the waste there will continue to produce methane gas, Jones said, for about 25 years after the last day solid waste is put there.
\
Bridgeo said the city also, longer term, plans to study the potential for installing solar panels at Hatch Hill, which could allow the site to produce more electricity on top of that potentially produced by the methane conversion system.
\
Councilors are scheduled to vote on the proposal to bring three-phase power to Hatch Hill at their next business meeting, scheduled for Thursday.
\
Bridgeo said if councilors approve and the proposal move forward, the system could go online in early 2018.
\
Over the last several years, the city has made other energy system upgrades at city facilities, including installing heat pumps and microturbines at Augusta City Center, as recommended by a study.
\
St. Pierre said the energy-producing part of the proposal will come back to councilors for consideration later, and consultants and the city staff will work to provide details on the cost and potential payback of the proposal.

306,"Dear Jim: With potential Y2K power outages and just normal ones due to storms, summer brownouts, etc., I am considering adding a PV system to my house. What do you think of this and do you have any tips? -- Russ A.\Dear Russ: Installing a PV, or photovoltaic electricity generating system, is an effective method to provide electricity during power outages. PV systems use solar cells that convert the sun's rays into electricity. Some small systems, like Evergreen, are sold as complete simple-to-install homeowner kits.\There have been improvements in solar cell efficiency and the costs have dropped. If your house needs a new roof, consider solar shingles. Solar cells are built into the shingles. These solar shingles are attached with nails just like ordinary shingles.\Solar cell panels are thin, lightweight and easy to handle. They can be tilted up on the roof or laid flat against it so they are barely visible from the ground. Since a PV system continuously generates electricity during daylight hours, at times it will produce more electricity than you need. Some of the excess electricity is used to keep several deep-draw backup batteries charged.\In many states and municipalities, utility companies must offer net metering billing. For your home, this means that your electric meter slows down or runs in reverse when the PV system is generating electricity. The primary reasons to install a PV system are for backup electricity or concern for the environment and your children's future. PV systems are silent, require very little maintenance (no moving parts) and create no pollution.\To plan a PV system, first determine the power usage of the appliances you need to keep running during an emergency. This often includes the refrigerator, a water or sump pump, lights and a radio or TV. With Y2K problems occurring in January, you may want to include your furnace blower.\The total of the wattages of these necessary electrical appliances determines the size of the battery pack that is required. During a power outage at night, all the electricity comes from the batteries. During the day, the solar panels provide electricity and keep the batteries charged.\Knowing the total wattage also determines the number of PV solar cell panels needed. This varies depending on the solar cell technology you choose, your budget and the amount of sun energy available in your area of the country. The two basic types of PV solar cells are crystalline and thin film. Crystalline has proven reliability and some kits have a 20-year warranty. Thin film is newer and less expensive, but requires larger panels and more area.\Write for (or instantly download -- www.dulley.com) Update Bulletin 812 -- buyer's guide of PV systems, kits, PV shingle manufacturers, selection-sizing guide and prices. Send $3 and a business-size SASE to James Dulley, Bangor Daily News, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244.\Dear Jim: We use our central air conditioner most of the summer. We have screen-storm doors and we leave the glass in year-round for security. Is the weatherstripping important and how can we tell if it's OK? -- Mandy N.\Dear Mandy: Although the condition of the weatherstripping on a storm door is not as important as on your primary door, it helps lower your utility bills if it seals well. The crack around the glass panels is often the most leaky area.\First adjust the storm door latch so that it closes as tightly as possible without hanging open. Pull your primary door open quickly. If you feel a suction air resistance as you pull it open, the storm door is sealing well."
307,"Why can't Maine be more like Massachusetts? That's a lament of clean energy advocates, who want to grow the amount of solar power generated in Maine. Massachusetts ranks first this year among states for having the best financial and policy incentives to encourage the installation of panels that convert sunlight into electricity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. By contrast, Maine is ranked 28th, tied with Indiana. But within these rankings are statistics that most solar advocates in Maine downplay or fail to recognize. In Massachusetts, nearly two-thirds of the output is generated by commercial and utility-scale projects. Since 2013, four times more solar output is coming from larger projects than from home installations. The Bay State's largest utility says these big solar projects are a better deal for utility customers, because the power generated is much less expensive than what comes from home rooftops. This is an important perspective in Maine. In a state where the focus is on small-scale rooftop solar, a battle is ramping up at the Public Utilities Commission over how much ratepayers benefit from the key financial reward that drives homeowners to put panels on their properties.\On a former landfill in Springfield, Massachusetts, 12,980 solar panels produce enough electricity to serve 850 homes. The Cottage Street project is one of three solar arrays in western Massachusetts that provide power to customers of the regional utility, Eversource Energy. \Taken together, these three projects produce more power than 40 percent of the entire installed solar capacity in the state of Maine. \Solar power is emerging as a key strategy to combat climate change and lower New England's dependence on fossil fuels. Massachusetts has become a national leader in solar, while Maine is a middle-of-the-pack laggard. \For example: Massachusetts ranks first in the country this year for having the best financial and policy incentives for solar, according to Solar Power Rocks.com, an advocacy website for homeowners. Maine is ranked 28th, tied with Indiana. \Massachusetts is rocking the solar world in part because it encourages big projects that can produce lower-cost power, including some utility-owned generation that's sold directly to customers. Maine law bans utility-owned generation, including solar. \In Maine, the ongoing debate over the future of solar energy is concentrated on small-scale, rooftop units and the rights of homeowners. \The potential benefits of big solar projects are overshadowed by the battle ramping up now at the Maine Public Utilities Commission over how to handle net energy billing, the decades-old practice of paying homeowners the full retail price of the surplus power they send to the grid. Sometimes called net metering, this practice is the key financial incentive that helps make solar electricity affordable to homeowners. \Whatever happens at the PUC, the outcome won't do much to advance Maine's overall solar standing. \In Massachusetts, nearly two-thirds of solar electricity is generated by commercial and utility-scale projects, according to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association. And since 2013, four times more solar output is coming from these larger projects than from home installations, figures from the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources show. \These facts highlight an important perspective that's largely missing in Maine, where the future of solar has deteriorated into a political spat between Democrats and Republicans over rooftop panels. \Utilities and Gov. Paul LePage say net metering forces other electric customers to subsidize solar for homeowners, a cost that will grow as more rooftop solar is installed. This view was at the core of LePage's veto of a hard-fought solar energy bill last spring in the Maine Legislature, a veto upheld largely with the help of Republicans. \Solar advocates and their Democratic allies, though, point to studies that show net metering in its current form actually saves more than it costs. One of those studies was done for Maine's PUC, and recently updated. \This dispute is happening in states across the country. Meanwhile, falling panel prices, government clean-energy policies and mounting evidence of climate change are leading to explosive solar growth in the United States. \As of March of this year, 27,455 megawatts of solar capacity were installed nationwide, according to the SEIA trade group. That's enough electricity to serve 5 million average homes. More than half of it came from utility-scale projects. A quarter came from commercial, community and institutional-size projects. A final 23 percent was generated at residential installations. \In Maine, there's plenty of political muscle behind the sector with the smallest capacity. \National solar installers that have built their business models on residential rooftop have emerged as active lobbyists in Maine's net metering war. Sunrun Inc., a noteworthy donor to Maine political action committees, as well as Solar City, through a recently formed group called Energy Freedom Coalition of America, are key participants in the PUC case. The state's solar installers also rely heavily on residential rooftop installations. They are backed by influential environmental groups, led by the Natural Resources Council of Maine. \The PUC has received more than 260 public comments on its case docket. Many come from residents who have installed panels on their homes or want to, citing concern for climate change and the environment. Many are form letters that begin: ""Please reject any attempt to get rid of net metering in Maine."" \CONSTRICTED INVESTING \Maine's 16-year-old electric industry restructuring law bans private utilities from generating any power, effectively keeping the well-financed parent companies of Central Maine Power and Emera Maine out of solar. \This policy has consequences, according to John Carroll, a spokesman for Avangrid, which owns CMP. Avangrid has 53 wind farms in 18 states and solar farms with a combined capacity of 50 megawatts in Colorado and Arizona. But a continuing legal challenge in Maine over the conditions under which utility affiliates could own generation is keeping Avangrid from directly investing in solar here, he said. \""Who are you benefiting by keeping out one of the largest, best-capitalized players?"" Carroll asked. \Maine has 19.4 megawatts of installed solar capacity. One utility-scale project, Carroll said, could double Maine's output. \""The problem is, we don't have enough solar, not that we don't have enough rooftop solar,"" he said. ""That's why we're lagging behind other states. We're arguing about the best way to protect a really inefficient solution."" \The vast majority of the larger-scale projects being built or proposed in Maine are by private companies that have signed power purchase agreements to sell the electricity to specific customers or utilities, either here or out of state. \For instance: Publicly owned Madison Electric works has contracted for a 4.8 megawatt solar farm that can serve 880 homes. It will be built and financed through a partnership and power-selling contract that includes IGS Energy of Dublin, Ohio, and Pittsfield-based Cianbro Corp. \Ranger Solar, a Yarmouth-based startup, has submitted proposals for a giant, 50-megawatt solar farm in Sanford. The power would be sold in Connecticut, but the project is contingent on Ranger winning a regionwide, clean-energy bidding competition. \Dirigo Solar, which has an office in Westbrook, says it's hoping to finalize power purchase agreements by year's end with CMP and Emera to build solar arrays ranging from five to 20 megawatts. It won PUC approval to install up to 75 megawatts of capacity, enough to power 10,000 homes. \Community solar farms, in which homeowners buy a share of the generation from a big solar array, are another way solar could grow. But Maine law currently limits farm shares to 10 customers. An attempt to increase the number died with the failed solar bill. \ECONOMIES OF SCALE \While big solar tries to get a footing in Maine, a law in Massachusetts, updated last spring, allows utilities to generate up to 35 megawatts of capacity from the sun.  \In addition to the 3.9 megawatt Cottage Street project, Eversource Energy owns the 2.3 megawatt Indian Orchard Solar project, which can serve 500 homes. It also is located on a former landfill in Springfield, and has 8,200 panels. \The oldest project is 1.8 megawatt Silver Lake Solar, located on formerly contaminated industrial land in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The 6-year-old array has 6,500 panels and can serve 300 homes. \Eversource has plans under the revised law to build 70 megawatts of solar on company-owned land that will help lower customer rates, according to James Daly, the vice president for energy supply at Eversource. Daly said the company can build big solar arrays at an installed cost of $3 a watt, compared to $4.50 a watt for small rooftop installations. \""The biggest economies are the economies of scale,"" he said. \It's less costly to buy panels by the thousands, Daly said, and it's cheaper to install them on the ground, rather than a roof. Eversource also realizes investment tax credits and can receive special capacity payments from the region's grid operator. \But Steve Hinchman, the financing director at Maine's largest solar installer, ReVision Energy in Portland, said there's a difference between cost and value. While a variety of incentives may make utility-owned solar cheaper to produce, he said, locally sited solar has a greater value for Mainers. \Homeowners pay the bulk of the cost of installing rooftop solar, Hinchman noted, while ratepayers finance utility-scale projects. He also said customers end up paying the cost of renewable energy credits that utilities receive for producing or buying clean power. Hinchman noted that studies, including the recently updated one for the Maine PUC, show that the value of solar energy greatly exceeds what homeowners are being paid under net metering, especially at times of high electricity demand. \""When you generate power on a summer afternoon, you're sending out more-valuable power than you are being paid for,"" he said. ""The utility's position is 'solar is only good if we own it.' That's a recipe to gouge ratepayers."" \Rooftop solar in Maine supports more than 56 companies and 330 workers who are involved in installing and servicing small-scale solar installations, SEIA data show. Rooftop solar gives homeowners control over their electric rates and a sense of independence. And with gains in battery technology and efficiency, some homeowners see a day coming when they can cut the utility cord and generate all their own power. \A newly formed group of solar installers and customers called the Solar Energy Association of Maine is asking the PUC to extend the net metering rule and protect existing customers. But the threat from climate change is so dire that Maine needs an ""all of the above"" approach, according to Steve Weems, who heads the group. \""We need a solar policy that supports small scale, intermediate and large scale,"" Weems said. ""All of it, in the interest in really moving the needle to a much greater penetration of solar.""

308,"AUGUSTA, Maine -- Gov. Paul LePage said Friday he would urge the three-member Maine Public Utilities Commission ""to resign in a heartbeat,"" saying their ""absolutely horrendous"" January decision on solar policy will hurt most of the state's electricity ratepayers.\The Republican governor called a rare news conference in Augusta to expand on remarks made during Tuesday's State of the State speech, when he said that he'd fire the three utility commissioners -- whom LePage appointed -- if he had the authority.\The conflict arises from a commission decision that rolled back ""net metering"" -- a policy in effect since the 1980s in Maine that allows homeowners with solar panels to be credited by utilities, including Central Maine Power, for excess power sent to the grid.\LePage has called for the policy's elimination, labeling it an unfair subsidy, and he vetoed a comprehensive solar bill last year that aimed to increase solar production tenfold in Maine.\For opposite reasons, LePage and environmentalists were angered by the decision, which will allow existing net-metered customers and those signing up before 2018 to be grandfathered at current rates for 15 years, but give reduced credits to those who enter the program through 2042.\Tim Schneider, Maine's public advocate who led a group of utilities, solar companies and others that developed last year's failed solar bill, said he was disappointed that LePage did not discuss a fix for the state's net-metering policy.\""I think that there is a constructive role that the governor's office could play in trying to fix this rule, which nobody likes,"" he said, ""and I think what was disappointing coming out of the briefing today is that they aren't planning on engaging to try and fix the problem.""\Patrick Woodcock, former head of the Governor's Energy Office, resigned in December, and LePage said Friday that he has no intention of filling the role.\On Friday, LePage reiterated his frustration with the commission, saying his only demand is to ""lower the cost"" of energy and ""do no harm to the environment."" LePage can't fire commissioners, but the term of one, former LePage chief lawyer Carlisle McLean, expires in March.\""The people who generate the solar power on their roof pay for the generation, but CMP is still going to bill you,"" he said.\PUC spokesman Harry Lanphear declined comment and commissioners didn't respond to requests for reaction. LePage also said Friday that he'd like to increase the commission from three to five members to add greater business experience to the panel.\During his six-year tenure, LePage has hammered state policy that he says picks ""winners and losers"" through subsidies, which has led to confrontations with environmentalists and clean energy industries.\That tension over short-term and long-term costs has defined energy debates during his tenure. On Friday, he noted that Maine has the nation's 11th-highest energy costs and handed out packets of letters from businesses dating back to 2014 mentioning it as an obstacle.\Solar advocates have argued that net metering helps sustain a small industry with growth potential. A 2015 report from Environment Maine found that Maine had the second-to-lowest capacity in New England, and The Solar Foundation pegged Maine's total of 330 jobs in the industry as last in the region.\Vaughan Woodruff, owner of the Pittsfield-based solar installer Insource Renewables, said Friday that it's extreme for LePage's attack on the PUC ruling, a decision he said includes ""some of the most anti-solar stances in the entire country.""\""The governor continues to use his office as a bully pulpit to push an anti-solar ideology,"" Woodruff said.

A strong solar policy, like L.D. 1504, makes jobs for electricians, engineers, installers and office workers like me. \If the Legislature fails to pass L.D. 1504, the Maine Public Utilities Commission's flawed net metering rule would take effect.

310,"
Earlier this year, a stakeholders group showed Maine how government is supposed to work.
\
Tasked with finding a fair way to expand the state's solar energy portfolio, representatives of interests that did not agree on much hammered out a compromise plan that would expand capacity while sharing the benefits among all ratepayers. Their ideas were drafted into a bill, and it passed both houses of the Legislature with strong bipartisan support.
\
Then Gov. Paul LePage and his allies in the Maine House of Representatives showed us how -- all too often -- government really does work. Le-Page vetoed the bill, and House Republican leaders made sure that it fell two votes short of the two-thirds required to override, dumping a year's work out the window.
\
Now we are seeing the consequences of that vote. The Maine Public Utilities Commission, made up of three LePage appointees, is proposing the phase-out of net energy billing, also known as net metering, the one program Maine has to encourage solar investment.
\
This is the wrong policy. It creates uncertainty for investors that would kill jobs in the solar industry, a rare bright spot in the Maine economy because of its potential for growth. Slowing solar expansion also means that the dirtiest electric plants will continue to come online in the summer to meet peak demand, contributing to air pollution and the greenhouse gas emissions that are changing the climate.
\
But not only is this the wrong policy, it's also the wrong process.
\
The PUC is treating this about-face as a technical change to the rules and something that it can do on its own. Since the politician who appointed the commissioners has a well-known prejudice against solar energy, this is a problem.
\
The executive branch has a role to play in developing energy policy, but it should not be the entire show. This issue should go back to the Legislature in January, where representatives of a broad range of Maine people can build on the work that has already been done by the stakeholders group and move the state in the right direction.
\
The best analysis of the issue is the Value of Solar Study, commissioned by the PUC in 2014 and conducted by an independent consultant. Because solar investment decreases demand for generation and transmission, and because it benefits the environment, the study's authors concluded that the power it produces would have a value of 33.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, much more than the 7 cents- to 13 cents-per-kwh rate at which solar customers are credited.
\
If the environmental benefits are not counted, the avoided costs alone would represent a value of 17 cents -- still less than the rate at which utilities compensate solar producers. It's a good deal.
\
But conversion to solar won't happen fast enough without the right financial incentives, even though the technology has dramatically come down in price. The insecurity that has come from merely talking about eliminating net metering has already discouraged investment. Slowing solar expansion not only kills jobs, but also hurts all Mainers by forcing them to buy dirtier and more expensive electricity during the summer peak.
\
Many states accept that logic and have put programs in place to make it easier to finance solar power. New York state, for example, has tax incentives and assistance for low-income customers who install solar, as well as net metering. For renters and others who cannot install solar panels where they live, the state also offers the option of belonging to community solar farms, saving these customers money and reducing demand for power.
\
New York now has about twice as much solar power as Maine on a per capita basis, and is anxious to bring on more. Massachusetts now produces 10 times more per capita solar power than Maine, and its Legislature passed a renewable energy law this year that will expand it even more.
\
These are complicated issues, and what's done in other states may not make sense here. Pushing too far in one direction could have negative consequences elsewhere. But balancing many interests in a policy for the whole state is what the Legislature is for. This is not a one-man job, no matter what the governor thinks.
\
For the benefit of our environment and our economy, Maine deserves to have a modern solar policy that facilitates more home-grown renewable energy. The Legislature should take back the lead on this issue and make the state government function the right way.

Paul LePage said Friday that he believes Maine's three Public Utilities Commission should resign and called for expanding the panel's membership in response to a solar energy decision that he predicted will have ""a devastating impact on the state.""\However, advocates for Maine's solar industry dismissed the governor's statements while predicting the PUC decision did not go far enough and will limit -- not foster -- solar energy's growth in the state.\Employing a prop of two model houses to illustrate his point, LePage suggested that the PUC's recent decision to continue offering financial incentives for rooftop solar panels will benefit only solar energy customers and the solar industry, not the average ratepayer. \LePage said the decision to continue a form of net-energy billing or ""net metering"" -- in which homeowners receive credits on their electric bills for excess solar energy they feed back into the grid -- will lead to a massive expansion in the solar industry and, in the process, make Maine even less competitive for businesses.\LePage said he would ""ask them to resign in a heartbeat"" and he repeated a statement that, if he had the authority, he would fire all three of his PUC appointees.\""I will tell you, and I make no bones about it, I am enormously disappointed in the PUC,"" LePage said. ""Those were all appointments that I have made. I thought that they understood that my only request, my only request on energy was this: Lower the cost and do no harm to the environment.""\The three commissioners -- Chairman Mark Vannoy, Bruce Williamson and Carlisle McLean -- declined to comment through a PUC spokesman. While LePage cannot remove commissioners during their terms, he will have an opportunity to fill one of the three seats with a new appointee when McLean's term ends in March. McLean was LePage's former chief legal counsel and senior natural resources policy adviser before joining the commission in February 2015 to complete an unexpired term.\In a Jan. 31 decision, the three-member PUC sought to find middle ground on net metering, which was the focus of a contentious political fight among the Legislature, LePage and different segments of the industry last year.\The PUC said homeowners who already have solar panels can continue to be paid at the full retail rate for the power they produce for 15 years. Those who install solar energy systems in 2018 or later would see the credits gradually reduced over time.\Solar installation companies and representatives of Maine's environmental community believe the PUC decision will cost jobs and said it creates more ""political volatility"" around a growing industry.\""Maine is already dead-last in New England for the solar industry, and the PUC decision ... is going to take us backward,"" said Phil Coupe, co-founder of the state's largest solar installation company, ReVision Energy. ""It is going to chill the appetite of people for solar because it diminishes their return on investment.""\Solar energy represents a tiny fraction of the energy production in Maine, and the net metering credits or incentives currently add a relatively small amount onto ratepayer bills. Central Maine Power Co., for instance, estimated that solar net metering cost ratepayers $1.3 million in 2015, although LePage said he believes the total amount for all utilities is now closer to $7 million.\LePage often blames solar energy, PUC decisions and lawmakers for driving up electricity prices. While Maine has the least-expensive retail electricity prices in New England, it currently ranks 11th highest in the nation. But Maine's small solar industry is not responsible for a dramatic shift in costs.\Instead, some larger electricity users in southern and central Maine have endured cost increases of, on average, 19 percent since last summer as a result of a complicated series of events that drove up delivery charges on CMP bills. Those factors include the conclusion of refunds for transmission line investments, additional money for the Efficiency Maine Trust and a pause in federal damage awards of lawsuits over defunct nuclear plants such as Maine Yankee in Wiscasset.\Asked how the PUC decision contributed to significant price increases given the small size of Maine's solar industry, LePage clarified that he is concerned about future prices since some level of net metering will continue through 2042.\""The reason I am so concerned is this opens up an industry that is going to skyrocket. Everybody is going to get these subsidies,"" LePage said. ""It's going to be a runaway industry and we are going to (have) stranded costs forever. We'd never get out of it.""\Nationwide, many homeowners who install solar energy panels rely on some form of net metering to help them recoup or offset the high, upfront installation costs. Those policies, combined with a dramatic drop in the prices for solar energy technology, have led to a national boom in which the industry has experienced an annual compound growth rate of 60 percent for the past decade, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association trade group.\As of last year, New England had roughly 1,774 megawatts of installed solar capacity, led by Massachusetts with 1,241 megawatts, Connecticut with 273 megawatts and Vermont with 154. Maine had by far the least of the six states, at 20 megawatts.\LePage had made lowering energy costs a top priority of his two terms on grounds that Maine's higher costs threaten the state's manufacturing sector and limit future economic growth. The Republican often dismisses the potential of the wind and solar energy industries -- two bright spots in the state's economy in recent years -- because he contends they are not cost-competitive.\""You are building an industry that doesn't pay for itself,"" LePage said Friday, adding that growth in the industry will only create temporary construction jobs.\Such statements anger renewable-energy advocates.\A 2015 PUC study suggested solar energy would have greater total monetary value -- when environmental and social benefits are included -- than conventional power generation if the technology were widely adopted. That is because solar energy systems reduce the costs of building or maintaining transmission and distribution infrastructure, natural gas pipelines, voltage regulation and environmental controls involved in traditional electricity generation.\Coupe accused LePage of ""repeatedly ignoring the facts of the world"" as he proposes policies hostile to renewable energy and casts the solar energy industry as a burden on all ratepayers. In fact, Coupe pointed to a January 2016 study by the federal government's National Renewable Energy Lab that showed Maine as having the second-highest percentage in the nation of installation of small-scale, low-priced solar energy systems.\""What that signals is that we are an incredibly efficient and lean industry in Maine, and we have to be to survive in this LePage era,"" Coupe said.

312,"legislature needs to take back energy policy\Earlier this year, a stakeholders group showed Maine how government is supposed to work. \Tasked with finding a fair way to expand the state's solar energy portfolio, representatives of interests that did not agree on much hammered out a compromise plan that would expand capacity while sharing the benefits among all ratepayers. Their ideas were drafted into a bill, and it passed both houses of the Legislature with strong bipartisan support. \Then Gov. LePage and his allies in the Maine House of Representatives showed us how - all too often - government really does work. LePage vetoed the bill, and House Republican leaders made sure that it fell two votes short of the two-thirds required to override, dumping a year's work out the window. \Now we are seeing the consequences of that vote. The Maine Public Utilities Commission, made up of three LePage appointees, is proposing the phase-out of net energy billing, also known as net metering, the one program Maine has to encourage solar investment. \WRONG DIRECTION \This is the wrong policy. It creates uncertainty for investors that would kill jobs in the solar industry, a rare bright spot in the Maine economy because of its potential for growth. Slowing solar expansion also means that the dirtiest electric plants will continue to come online in the summer to meet peak demand, contributing to air pollution and the greenhouse gas emissions that are changing the climate. \But not only is this the wrong policy, it's also the wrong process. \The PUC is treating this about-face as a technical change to the rules and something that it can do on its own. Since the politician who appointed the commissioners has a well-known prejudice against solar energy, this is a problem. \The executive branch has a role to play in developing energy policy, but it should not be the entire show. This issue should go back to the Legislature in January, where representatives of a broad range of Maine people can build on the work that has already been done by the stakeholders group and move the state in the right direction. \The best analysis of the issue is the Value of Solar Study, commissioned by the PUC in 2014 and conducted by an independent consultant. Because solar investment decreases demand for generation and transmission, and because it benefits the environment, the study's authors concluded that the power it produces would have a value of 33.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, much more than the 7 cents- to 13 cents-per-kwh rate at which solar customers are credited. \If the environmental benefits are not counted, the avoided costs alone would represent a value of 17 cents - still less than the rate at which utilities compensate solar producers. It's a good deal. \But conversion to solar won't happen fast enough without the right financial incentives, even though the technology has dramatically come down in price. The insecurity that has come from merely talking about eliminating net metering has already discouraged investment. Slowing solar expansion not only kills jobs, but also hurts all Mainers by forcing them to buy dirtier and more expensive electricity during the summer peak. \WORKING ELSEWHERE \Many states accept that logic and have put programs in place to make it easier to finance solar power. New York state, for example, has tax incentives and assistance for low-income customers who install solar, as well as net metering. For renters and others who cannot install solar panels where they live, the state also offers the option of belonging to community solar farms, saving these customers money and reducing demand for power. \New York now has about twice as much solar power as Maine on a per capita basis, and is anxious to bring on more. Massachusetts now produces 10 times more per capita solar power than Maine, and its Legislature passed a renewable energy law this year that will expand it even more. \These are complicated issues, and what's done in other states may not make sense here. Pushing too far in one direction could have negative consequences elsewhere. But balancing many interests in a policy for the whole state is what the Legislature is for. This is not a one-man job, no matter what the governor thinks. \For the benefit of our environment and our economy, Maine deserves to have a modern solar policy that facilitates more home-grown renewable energy. The Legislature should take back the lead on this issue and make the state government function the right way."

316,"Augusta City Council on Thursday is expected to approve the expenditure of about $240,000 to pay for preliminary design for a project to use methane gas from the landfill to generate power. Meeting at 6:30 p.m. LATE\City to spend $240K to turn methane gas into electricity\AUGUSTA ï¿½ City councilors on Thursday approved a plan to spend about $240,000 to design a system to use methane gas produced by decomposing garbage at Hatch Hill landfill to make electricity and reduce the cityï¿½s electric bills.\The city-owned landfill that takes solid waste from residents in several area municipalities is expected to produce enough methane gas from decomposing garbage to power generators for the next 15 years, according to a report produced as officials consider building the system to use landfill gas to produce electricity.\The electricity the system produces would be fed into the electrical grid, for which the city would receive a credit on its Central Maine Power electric bill to offset the cost of powering up to nine different city and school buildings.\Councilors voted 5-0 on Thursday to appropriate $240,000 from the Hatch Hill expense fund to be used to pay for the system to be designed.\At-Large Councilor Marci Alexander reminded city staff they need to do a more in depth analysis of the return on investment expected from the project before it proceeds too far.\ï¿½I want to make sure weï¿½re still in agreement,ï¿½ she said. ï¿½Weï¿½re going to have the life-cycle cost analysis done at the beginning of the project.ï¿½\Ralph St. Pierre, finance director and assistant city manager, said that would be done. St. Pierre told councilors last week an estimated return on investment could be produced by June. He said, however, heï¿½d like to keep work on the proposal moving.\St. Pierre said if the numbers donï¿½t look good, the city can halt the project at any time, though he expressed confidence the project will be able to pay for itself, and then some.\Engineers with Portland engineering firm Woodard and Curran who studied the landfillï¿½s potential as a source of fuel said it should produce enough gas to produce 350 kilowatt hours of electricity a year, for 15 years, and potentially more.\City officials said the project could be considered viable if it can reliably produce 350 kilowatts of electricity a year, which would be enough to pay back the estimated $1.9 million cost of building the system in 12 to 15 years, with the potential to return revenues beyond that.\Projections in the Woodard and Curran report indicate it can produce that much electricity.\The city already captures, and burns off with a flare, methane gas produced at the landfill to prevent it from escaping into the environment.\The payback on the project would rely on controversial net metering rules, which could be changed by the state Public Utilities Commission. Under net metering, utilities credit the bills of small energy generators for the full retail price of all the electricity they send into the grid. The city proposal would rely on net metering provisions that could allow the city to get about 8.5 cents per kilowatt hour in credits it could use to pay electricity bills at some of the city and schoolsï¿½ biggest energy-using buildings, such as the Augusta Civic Center and Cony High School. And it would cost an estimated 6 cents per kilowatt hour to generate that electricity at Hatch Hill, using methane from the landfill to power generators that would produce electricity, according to a previous study.\The city could designate up to nine sites where the electricity usage would be included in the net-metering plan.\The PUC has recommended changes that could make net metering less beneficial to small power producers, which the city would be. However, an energy services consultant working for the city on the proposal said previously the currently proposed new rules still could allow the city to pay for the energy project and bring the city savings beyond the investment payback.\Producing electricity at Hatch Hill would require the addition of three-phase power at the site, which could be done as part of a separate, approximately $375,000 project. Councilors approved that project in a previous vote.\While the current landfill is projected to be full in 12 to 15 years, the facility is expected by city officials to still be used as a disposal site, where three-phase power would be needed. And the waste there will continue to produce methane gas, Public Works Director Lesley Jones said, for about 25 years after the last day solid waste is put there.\Credit: By KEITH EDWARDS Staff Writer"
317,"AUGUSTA, Maine -- It didn't go far enough for Gov. Paul LePage, but Maine utility regulators rankled advocates on Tuesday when they rolled back a policy allowing homeowners with solar panels to be credited for excess power sent to the grid.\The move was opposed by pro-solar groups, and it's likely to be followed by another bid in the Maine Legislature to liberalize solar policy. Much of the dispute has been over ""net metering,"" the credit from utilities that Maine's more than 2,000 residential solar power users can be eligible for.\Advocates for the policy call it a necessary incentive supporting Maine's small solar industry, but LePage has long called for its elimination, saying it's an unfair subsidy. Last year, the Republican vetoed a bill that aimed to increase solar production tenfold in the state.\Net metering was established in the 1980s to help users recoup the initial investment in a systems, but costs to do so have since dropped. Last year, Central Maine Power said these users made up 1 percent of peak demand, triggering Maine Public Utilities Commission review.\The final rule package was finalized on Tuesday, allowing existing customers and those signing up before 2018 to be grandfathered at current rates for 15 years, but those who enter the program after that will get reduced credits.\LePage blasted the commission's decision in a statement, saying that by continuing net metering, the commission ""continues to shift the burden away from those who choose to install and have the resources to afford roof-top solar installations"" and onto ratepayers and businesses.\Maine's solar industry saw more than 50 percent growth in the past year, but that belies a small capacity. A report from Environment Maine found that the state's cumulative solar capacity in 2015 was second to last in New England, while The Solar Foundation found that the state's 330 jobs in the solar industry was last in the region on a total and per-capita basis.\Dylan Voorhees, clean energy director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, called the commission's move ""a roll-back of the one thing that is sustaining some amount of a solar market in the state.""\Advocates will now turn their attention to the Legislature, where Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, is proposing a bill that would enshrine net metering in statute, roll back barriers to community solar projects -- now capped in at 10 users here -- and re-establish a solar rebate program.\Voorhees said that after the commission's move, the Legislature must act at a ""critical moment"" for the industry.\""We're in last place,"" he said.

No surprise, really, to see a photovoltaic system outside a company that sells the hardware.\[image removed] Caption:\Naoto Inoue, owner of Solar Market in Arundel, installed 144 solar panels on his property. The electricity allows him to fully power his business and provides nearly 70 percent of his heat.\Gabe Souza/Staff Photographer\But this set-up is way larger than needed to run lights and appliances. And therein lies the surprise: These solar panels generated enough power last winter to supply nearly 70 percent of the building's warmth -- with electric heat.\The falling price of photovoltaic panels, along with the advent of special heat pumps and super insulation, is creating an opportunity in Maine that energy experts could hardly imagine a few years ago. Now some of the state's leading solar installers, including Solar Market, have begun installing so-called PV panels on homes and businesses to harvest sunshine for baseboard heaters.\The new economics of PV panels also has some companies moving away from promoting solar-thermal collectors designed to heat water, a mainstay of the business in Maine for 30 years.\""We stopped selling solar hot water three years ago,"" said Naoto Inoue, who owns Solar Market and has hot-water panels on his house. ""I would never do it again. I would put up all PV.""\What's starting to happen in Maine reflects an era of dizzying change taking place in the global solar industry.\PV module prices are down 50 percent in the past three years; they've fallen by roughly one-third in the past 12 months. Manufacturing growth in China, among other factors, has led to overcapacity and financial losses. Trade publications predict that competition will continue to drive down prices next year, as the industry struggles to consolidate and match supply with demand.\Maine solar installers are taking advantage of this environment, as well as state and federal laws that encourage the use of renewable energy. A visit to Solar Market's 3,500-square-foot office shows one way to do it.\Out back, the oversized solar system has a capacity of 50 kilowatts. In the summer, it can produce up to 300 percent more power than the business needs. The system is tied into the power grid, and Maine's net-metering law requires utilities to buy renewable power and credit any surplus to the customer's account. That allows Solar Market to bank much of its surplus for winter, when days are short and the office needs heat.\Typical electric resistance heaters would eat up too much energy, however. In the basement, Inoue has a high-efficiency, air-source heat pump. This device uses a relatively small amount of electricity to extract the marginal heat in cold, outside air. The heat is transferred to water, which is stored in an insulated tank and circulated through baseboards.\This approach wouldn't work if the building was drafty and poorly insulated. Inoue gutted the walls of the old farmhouse and barn to create an 18-inch- thick cavity of foam block and cellulose. The walls now have an R-value of 40, twice that of a typical home. The roof is R-60. The building's tight enough now to be warmed with only 17 feet of baseboards, a radiant floor loop and a couple of infrared, electric space heaters.\Critical to this equation is a 30 percent federal tax credit that cuts the cost of the PV system to $105,000. That's still not cheap. But Inoue figures he's getting electricity at under 10 cents a kilowatt hour for the 25-year life of the system. That's already less than today's utility rates.\Homeowners thinking about this approach typically undertake new construction, but not always. In Sanford, Cliff Babkirk has been able to get 40 percent of the space heat at an existing house from PV panels. Babkirk heavily insulated and air-sealed the home, installed a heat pump and is careful with electric use. He also kept his oil boiler to heat water, using 100 gallons a year.\Babkirk's system costs $17,600 after tax credits and a state rebate. He's happy enough with the performance that he plans to add more panels and pull another 20 percent of his heat from the sun. Earlier this month, he hosted an open house that was part of a national tour of solar and energy-efficient homes.\""We wanted to let people see a regular house,"" he said.\The project was installed by ReVision Energy in Portland. The company has done more than a dozen PV-heat systems over the past year.\Most are in new construction, where heavy insulation can be installed from scratch. The company also favors newly developed air-source heat pumps that work well in Maine's cold climate, and cost roughly $4,000.\""It has opened the door to these opportunities, which seemed remote in 2008,"" said Fortunat Mueller, a partner.\Homeowners looking to heat with solar electricity need a frugal refrigerator, washing machine and lights. If they can cut their power demand to around 265 kilowatt hours a month, they can do a lot of the job with a 3.5 kilowatt PV system. That would cost roughly $14,000 after tax credits and rebates, Mueller estimated, plus the cost of one of two heat pumps.\""For that you are essentially prepaying your entire electric and fuel bill for the life of the home,"" he said. ""It is pretty amazing.""\Solar hot water, heated with thermal collectors, is a different story.\Hot water panels remain cheaper than solar electric. But in Maine, the panels produce more hot water in the summer than most homes need, and not enough in winter. Hot water can't be stored indefinitely, and there's no way to bank the energy in the form of utility credits.\These factors have tipped the balance away from solar hot water in Maine, in Inoue's view. Mueller, however, isn't ready to make that break.\""I don't think we're at a point yet where solar thermal stops making sense,"" he said.\But another variable for hot water has entered the picture in recent years: Hybrid water heaters. Available now at home improvement stores, they look like conventional water heaters, but use heat-pump technology to warm water for a fraction of the cost. That's making solar-electric panels an option for heating water, too, Mueller said.\Staff Writer Tux Turkel can be contacted at 791-6462 or\tturkel@pressherald.com\Credit: By Tux Turkel tturkel@mainetoday.com Staff Writer"
319,"AUGUSTA, Maine -- With the term of Maine Public Utilities Commission member Carlisle McLean due to expire in March, Gov. Paul LePage has said he wants to nominate a new person to the three-member regulatory board.\But you can rule out one person: Jim LaBrecque, a self-taught electrical engineer, heat pump evangelist and alternative energy critic from Bangor whom LePage floated Tuesday on WVOM as a potential pick for the commission. LaBrecque told the Bangor Daily News on Tuesday that he and the governor haven't discussed an appointment.\The Republican governor still is fuming over utility regulators' decision in late January to roll back and not eliminate ""net metering,"" the solar energy policy that allows people with panels to claim credits for energy sent to the grid.\All three commissioners were nominated by LePage, but in his State of the State speech last week, he said he'd fire them if he had the authority. On Friday, he urged them to resign.\And on Tuesday, he said he was ""looking for a new PUC commissioner"" to replace McLean, his former chief lawyer who was appointed in 2015 to complete the term vacated by Tom Welch, the commission's previous chairman. McLean is the only commissioner whose term will end before LePage leaves office in January 2019.\During a radio interview in which he repeated his criticism of the commission's net metering decision, LePage floated LaBrecque's name as potential replacement that he's considering, though LePage noted that LaBrecque would have ""difficulty getting confirmed.""\But LaBrecque said he didn't want the job, citing his businesses and a special-needs son. He said he and LePage also haven't talked about such a job, although he said he plans to join LePage's office as a staff adviser later in the year so he can speak more formally on behalf of the administration.\""I think he's like myself,"" LaBrecque said of LePage's remark. ""We're just pronto, right off the cuff and I'm sure if he had to think about what he said and make a formal statement, he would have said something different.""\LaBrecque said serving as a utilities regulator wouldn't fit his ""technical expertise"" and agreed with LePage that confirmation would be difficult, saying ""armies of people"" would be ""trying to do me in because I'm not supporting their stuff.""\He also said he enjoyed his informal role advising LePage.\""I can speak the way I want to speak and talk frankly to the facts because nobody can fire me,"" he said. ""They can't call my mother; she's dead. They can't call my boss; that's me.""\Democrats say LePage is ""180 degrees wrong"" about solar and wrong to attack the PUC. Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, who is co-chairman of the Legislature's energy committee, said many lawmakers and the majority of Mainers understand that the spread of solar-generated energy is good for both the economy and the environment.\""What independent studies have shown is that solar is actually contributing not only to job creation in Maine but also to keep energy prices down overall,"" he said Tuesday. ""If anything, the subsidy is being provided by solar owners to others. If we're going to talk about subsidy, let's talk about how we would be subsidizing Canadian hydro. Let's talk about how we have subsidized biomass and really open up the conversation to a level playing field.""\Berry had no comment about the prospect of LaBrecque being nominated to the PUC.\Credit: Christopher Cousins and Michael Shepherd BDN Staff"
320,"Environmental organization seeking reversal of new 'net metering' policies\AUGUSTA -- Maine's largest environmental organization pledged Wednesday to ""pursue every opportunity"" to reverse controversial solar energy rules adopted by the Public Utilities Commission.\In late January, the PUC approved new rules that change ""net metering"" policies providing homeowners with credits on their electricity bills for excess solar energy they feed back into the grid. Under the new rules, which were finalized Wednesday, homeowners who already have solar panels can continue to receive credit at the full retail rate for the power they produce for 15 years. Those who install solar energy systems in 2018 or later would see the credits gradually reduced over time.\The PUC's changes were criticized strongly by installation companies and environmental groups, as well as by Gov.

321,"kj.augustamethane.0511: Late. Covering Augusta City Council. They're to get update, and presumably discuss (but not vote on) proposal to have a generator system built at Hatch Hill landfill that'd use methane gas generated by rotting garbage there to produce electricity which would go into the grid in exchange for credits which could be applied to city's electric bills for its big users such as Cony/CATC, maybe City Center or Civic Center. A consultant looked into the feasibility and whether the numbers would work. From my initial read of that report, it looks like ""probably"" is the answer to that. Potential issue could be whether it produces enough, or converserly too much, gas to take advantage of the convoluted PUC rules for such things. They're already capturing methane there, but are flaring it off just to prevent it from going into atmosphere as pollution.\AUGUSTA -- The Hatch Hill landfill is expected to produce enough methane gas from decomposing garbage to power generators for the next 15 years, according to a report produced as officials ponder building a system to use landfill gas to produce electricity to power some city and school buildings.\City councilors, after hearing from consultants who produced the report, expressed support for moving ahead with the proposal Thursday, but said they want to see more detailed numbers before committing to it fully.\Paul Porada, an engineer with Portland engineering firm Woodard and Curran, said the landfill should produce enough gas to produce 350 kilowatt hours of electricity a year, for 15 years, and potentially more.\""There is methane being produced today, and that will continue for the foreseeable future,"" Porada said.\City officials said the project could be considered viable if it can reliably produce 350 kilowatts of electricity a year, which would be enough to pay back the estimated $1.9 million cost of building the system in 12 to 15 years, with the potential to return revenues beyond that.\Projections in the Woodard and Curran report indicate it can produce that much electricity.\In fact, they anticipate the landfill will generate ""significantly"" more gas than will be used for power generation, and recommend the city seek other ways to take financial advantage of the additional available landfill gas.\City councilors expressed interest, but At-large Councilor Marci Alexander said she wanted to see a solid estimate of the return on investment before committing to the next step, which would be authorizing the expenditure of about $240,000 to pay for preliminary design for the project.\""I'd like to see the return on investment now, before we spend the $240,000\Ralph St. Pierre, finance director and assistant city manager, said an estimated return on investment could be produced by June. He said, however, he'd like to keep work on the proposal moving.\Mayor David Rollins said he will sponsor an order for councilors to consider, at their business meeting next week, authorizing the expenditure of $240,000 to begin.\St. Pierre said if the numbers don't look good, the city can halt the project at any time, though he expressed confidence the project will be able to pay for itself, and then some.\The city already captures, and burns off with a flare, methane gas produced at the landfill to prevent it from escaping into the environment.\The payback on the project would rely on controversial net metering rules, which could be changed by the state Public Utilities Commission. Under net metering, utilities credit the bills of small energy generators for the full retail price of all the electricity they send into the grid. The city proposal would rely on net metering provisions that could allow the city to get about 8.5 cents per kilowatt hour in credits it could use to pay electricity bills at some of the city and schools' biggest energy-using buildings, such as the Augusta Civic Center and Cony High School. And it would cost an estimated 6 cents per kilowatt hour to generate that electricity at Hatch Hill, using methane from the landfill to power generators that would produce electricity.\The city could designate up to nine sites where the electricity usage would be included in the net-metering plan.\The PUC has recommended changes that could make net metering less beneficial to small power producers, which the city would be. However, an energy services consultant working for the city on the proposal said previously the currently proposed new rules still could allow the city to pay for the energy project and bring the city savings beyond the investment payback.\Producing electricity at Hatch Hill would require the addition of three-phase power at the site, which could be done as part of a separate, approximately $375,000 project. Councilors approved that project in a previous vote.\""I'm ready to move forward on this,"" At-large Councilor Corey Wilson said. ""It's a risk, but in my mind I already took that risk when said OK to spending $400,000 to bring in three-phase power.""\While the current landfill is projected to be full in 12 to 15 years, the facility, city officials have said, probably still will be used as a disposal site, where three-phase power would be needed. And the waste there will continue to produce methane gas, Public Works Director Lesley Jones said, for about 25 years after the last day solid waste is put there.\Credit: By KEITH EDWARDS Staff Writer"

323,"BAR HARBOR, Maine -- When it comes to renewable energy development projects and finding new ways to finance them, there have been many ""firsts"" in Maine over the past decade or so.\Solar projects, using photovoltaic cells to generate electricity, have become popular throughout the state in recent years, and one that recently has been approved in Bar Harbor was celebrated Monday as the first community solar ""farm"" to be permitted on a publicly owned property.\A small crowd gathered Monday morning at the town's public works site off Crooked Road to mark the start of the development of the solar array, which will involve the installation of 188 panels on the roof of a vehicle storage building. Local residents and municipal officials, officials with ReVision Energy, and U.S. Sen. Angus King were among the 40 or so people at the event.\The project is expected to generate 59,000 kilowatt-hours each year for six local electricity users -- four homeowners, one apartment building and Peekytoe Provisions, a retail seafood business on Main Street.\Though located on town property, the solar project is not being financed by the town, nor is it generating electricity for the town, which already has installed its own solar panels on the same property on the roof of the main public works building. The new solar array will generate lease income for the town, but it is being paid for solely by the cooperative's members, who each contributed $1,000 or more to get the project up and running.\John Luft, branch manager for ReVision Energy, said Monday that there are six other private, member-financed solar farms in Maine, all of which are located on private property and are in Central Maine Power's service area in southern and western Maine. The one in Bar Harbor will be the first on publicly owned land and the first in Emera's transmission area in eastern and northern Maine, he said.\Josh Ehrlich, a member of the local solar cooperative, said he is glad that construction of the Bar Harbor project is getting under way.\""It's the right thing to do,"" he said, adding that it took more than a year of planning and permitting before work could start. ""It's exciting that we're finally moving forward.""\Ehrlich said that the practice of net-metering -- a regulated process by which entities that generate electricity for themselves can get credit for excess power they send back into the grid at the same rate that they pay for power when they need it -- helps make solar power development financially feasible for small-scale residential users such as himself. The state is considering whether to alter the mandated financial equation for net-metering, however, which could alter the financial implications for small-scale users looking to install their own power-generation devices, such as solar panels or wind turbines.\""We hope that the Public Utilities Commission supports what we're doing, as opposed to trying to take away our ability to invest in our own future,"" Ehrlich said.\Gary Friedmann, vice chairman of the local Town Council and a proponent of the project, said the solar farm fits into a separate, citizen-led initiative on Mount Desert Island called "" A Climate to Thrive,"" which has a goal of making MDI energy independent by 2030. He said that if every existing and suitable rooftop on the island were outfitted with solar panels, they could generate 85 percent of the entire island's energy needs.\But he said the state needs to do more to help preserve financial incentives for small-scale solar power development.\Renewable energy generation is needed in order to reduce Maine's dependence on fossil fuels, the use of which is causing climate change and threatening the environment for future generations, Friedmann added.\""If Maine is going to continue to lead in the sustainable economy we're going to have to come up with better legislation and better ways of integrating and encouraging solar energy in this state,"" Friedmann said.\Sen. King steered clear of political criticism in his remarks about the budding solar farm in Bar Harbor. He spoke about the practical aspects of pursuing renewable power development in Maine.\""We have a tremendous solar resource and tremendous solar potential in this state,"" King said.\The economics of installing solar panels, for which the cost has come down through improved technology and increased demand, is much more viable than it was a few decades ago, King said. Not only is solar power development good for the environment, he said, but it's good for consumers, too.\""Solar is now competitive with virtually any [other] form of energy -- competitive,"" King said, stressing the last word. ""And it's going to become more so.""\Many other businesses, municipalities and nonprofit institutions in Maine have implemented or are pursuing similar solar power development projects. For example, last year Belfast installed 180 panels on the roof of its fire station while in Freeport, town officials are helping to arrange group purchases of solar panels that residents would have installed on their properties.\Credit: Bill Trotter BDN Staff"

Paul LePage is waging a war on solar energy in Maine. LD 1649, An Act To Modernize Maine's Solar Power Policy and Encourage Economic Development, has passed the House and Senate and faces an almost certain veto by our bought-by-fossil-fuel-interests governor.\If LePage's veto is not overridden, the Maine Public Utilities Commission will decide how to deal with net metering, which determines compensation for producers of solar electricity. All three commissioners have been appointed by LePage, and if given the opportunity, they are expected to weaken or kill net metering.\What is at stake is the survival of the solar energy industry in Maine. If net metering is eliminated or weakened, companies will be forced to close their doors, good paying solar jobs will be lost and Maine will continue to lag behind other states transitioning to clean energy.\The only way to stop this from happening is to override the veto. At this time both the House and Senate lack the votes to override.

I understand their desire to alleviate the poverty of their families in their native lands. But unlike immigration from the past, that $68 billion earned from American jobs is not being spent in American communities. No one suggests we stop this money flow. But it raises the question, should we increase immigration in the future as bipartisan elites are promoting, increasing this financial loss to local businesses?\Remittances increase consumption in poor countries. But this money does not promote the political reforms and structural changes that poor countries need in order to provide their citizens with good jobs and fair government. In fact, just the opposite. Remittances alleviate the pressure on corrupt and wealthy elites to share the wealth and tackle poverty in their countries. How convenient.\What would we think if our politicians encouraged America's poor to run to Canada, defy their immigration laws, provide documentation to help them get driver's licenses, open bank accounts, use Canadian public services, and then scream ""racism"" and ""hate,"" if Canadians began to demand that their immigration laws be enforced?\Julie Tosswill\Hope\Reduce carbon emissions\Earth Day is a good time to reflect on how we each affect the environment. Climate change and ocean acidification are critical issues facing us, and it is urgent to take action. Most experts agree that a global carbon tax is urgently needed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and slow climate change and ocean acidification.\Meanwhile, many of us can take personal action and help to make the transition to a world where the use of fossil fuels is minimized. We can reduce our personal carbon emissions with improved home insulation, better gas mileage, flying and driving less, and purchasing fewer goods. We can also purchase 100 percent Maine-sourced renewable electricity.\Even with such actions, almost all of us will cause the burning of substantial fossil fuels to support our lifestyle. We can help to reduce the effect of this by buying carbon offsets. One source of these is CarbonFund.org. This nonprofit organization sells carbon offsets where the money is used to reduce carbon emissions, using several different approaches. You can choose the approach that you prefer. One approach is to fund renewable sources of electricity that replace electricity generated from fossil fuels. Another is to prevent deforestation. There also are projects that result in more efficient use of electricity.\Maine Green Power offers Mainers the option to use local renewable energy to power their homes with a fixed $3.75 or $7.50 added to their monthly electricity bill. In addition to helping the environment, buying Maine Green Power also supports good jobs within our state.\John Tjepkema\Orono"
325,"DRESDEN, Maine Like many farms across Maine, Goranson Farm is in the early stages of a generational shift.\Carl Johanson, 26, is poised to take over the reins of the farm with his younger brother Goran, 21, when their parents Jan Goranson and Rob Johanson are ready to step back from the daily operations of the 80-acre farm, which Goranson's parents began as a potato operation in the 1960s.\But succession plans haven't been delineated just yet, and for the present moment, the family is at a point where they are working together, each doing their part running different aspects of the organic diversified vegetable farm.\This collaborative phase is allowing the members of the Goranson-Johanson clan to each pursue what they are interested in on the farm. And while the younger generation is channeling nostalgic farming practices by expanding horse-driven cultivation on the farm, Rob Johanson is using new technology -- in the form of a recently installed solar array -- to power the farm toward a more sustainable future.\""It's a really cool juxtaposition. You've got the horses, which are kind of the original form of renewable energy, and then you've got the technological solution to energy generation with the solar array,"" Carl Johanson said.\The farm's 25,000-kilowatt grid-tied solar installation, consisting of four large mounted solar arrays, has the potential to cover the farm's entire power needs, including the Goranson homestead located on farm grounds.\While he's admittedly the skeptic in the family when it comes the solar panels, Carl Johanson is grateful that his father is thinking about the future of the farm's energy independence, which someday will be in his hands.\""My dad sets a pretty strong example,"" Carl Johanson said. ""He has always described the progression of society in terms of the innovators, early adopters, and then everybody else who follows after, and he's definitely one of those people who wants to be an early adopter.""\A progressive history\But this isn't the first generational shift that has brought changes to the operations at Goranson Farm.\Thirty years ago, when Goranson came back to the farm from California, where she was attending school, she brought with her fresh ideas about the possibility of local agriculture.\Being out West in an urban area and experiencing the local markets that were a stronghold there, Goranson was inspired to diversify her parents' potato farm and expand beyond simply selling to commodity markets.\""It planted this seed that maybe we could grow something other than potatoes on the farm,"" Goranson said.

326,"DRESDEN, Maine -- Like many farms across Maine, Goranson Farm is in the early stages of a generational shift.\Carl Johanson, 26, is poised to take over the reins of the farm with his younger brother Goran, 21, when their parents Jan Goranson and Rob Johanson are ready to step back from the daily operations of the 80-acre farm, which Goranson's parents began as a potato operation in the 1960s.\But succession plans haven't been delineated just yet, and for the present moment the family is at a point where they are working together, each doing their part running different aspects of the organic diversified vegetable farm.\This collaborative phase is allowing the members of the Goranson-Johanson clan to each pursue what they are interested in on the farm. And while the younger generation is channeling nostalgic farming practices by expanding horse-driven cultivation on the farm, Rob Johanson is using new technology -- in the form of a recently installed solar array -- to power the farm toward a more sustainable future.\""It's a really cool juxtaposition. You've got the horses, which are kind of the original form of renewable energy, and then you've got the technological solution to energy generation with the solar array,"" Carl Johanson said.\The farm's 25,000-watt grid-tied solar installation, consisting of four large mounted solar arrays, has the potential to cover the farm's entire power needs, including the Goranson homestead located on farm grounds.\While he admittedly is the skeptic in the family when it comes the solar panels, Carl Johanson is grateful his father is thinking about the future of the farm's energy independence, which someday will be in his hands.\""My dad sets a pretty strong example,"" Carl Johanson said. ""He has always described the progression of society in terms of the innovators, early adopters, and then everybody else who follows after, and he's definitely one of those people who wants to be an early adopter.""\A progressive history\But this isn't the first generational shift that has brought changes to the operations at Goranson Farm.\Thirty years ago, when Goranson came back to the farm from California, where she was attending school, she brought with her fresh ideas about the possibility of local agriculture.\Being out West in an urban area and experiencing the local markets that were a stronghold there, Goranson was inspired to diversify her parents' potato farm and expand beyond simply selling to commodity markets.\""It planted this seed that maybe we could grow something other than potatoes on the farm,"" Goranson said. ""We decided that we really wanted to not be a commodity farmer, relying strictly on wholesalers and [having them] set the price for our crops.""\In 1986, Goranson joined a farmers market, the first for her family's farm.

327,"As a public school teacher and concerned citizen of Maine, I was disappointed to learn of the LePage-appointed Maine PUC commissioners' decision to phase out net-metering for roof-top solar.\According to two surveys taken in 2016, more than 60 percent of Mainers support net-metering. Contrary to what Gov. LePage purports, solar arrays, in addition to providing many blue collar jobs to Mainers, also reduce our electric costs because they lessen the need for new pipelines, transmission lines and substations. Maine is the perfect place for solar energy because our greatest need for electricity comes when we have the longest, sunniest days -- summertime. And during peak times, electricity from rarely used generating plants costs considerably more to produce.\Thankfully, Rep. Seth Berry will be bringing a bill (LD 1373) to the Legislature on Thursday, May 4, which will:\[bullet] Protect net-metering;\[bullet] Re-establish the solar rebate fund and allow for third-party ownership of a solar installation, assisting people with the up-front cost of installing solar panels.\I hope others will join me in urging their representatives to pass this bill. It makes good sense economically and environmentally and provides good jobs to Maine people. It also keeps our power local and lessens our reliance on sources outside of Maine.\Keeps Maine jobs, saves consumers some money and protects the environment -- it is a win-win-win solution to Maine's energy needs.\Wendy Schlotterbeck, Auburn"
328,"Throughout the world, the nation and our region, governments are partnering with the private sector to foster the critical transition to clean, renewable energy. Maine has lagged far behind and continues to see valuable green energy jobs and billions of energy dollars leave the state each year. Maine’s regressive solar policy stands in the way of a just and equitable transition to a clean, green economy. Now is the time for Maine lawmakers to step up and stem the tide of capital and talent leaving this state and bolster Maine’s reputation as an environmental leader.\In 2017-2018, The Center for an Ecology Based Economy, a climate action organization in the town of Norway, participated in the Solar in Your Community Challenge, a U.S. Department of Energy program to “bring solar to all Americans, especially underserved communities …” CEBE was one of nearly 200 groups nationwide selected to participate. We were awarded $20,000 in technical support to develop a detailed and replicable business model to serve low- and moderate-income households in our rural western Maine community who want access to solar power. CEBE’s Energy Working Group dedicated more than a thousand hours to work with a variety of community members and expert consultants to hammer out a plan.\Through a series of public forums attended by more than 100 citizens, as well as through individual meetings, CEBE reached out to small businesses and low- and moderate-income community members, finding overwhelming support for community solar. Especially attractive to both individuals and businesses was the predictability of their energy bills over the next three to four decades, regardless of potential volatility in fossil energy markets. Many, however, simply expressed a desire to do the right thing for the environment.\Despite the strong desires of many in our community to transition to clean renewable energy, our community solar farm remains unbuilt, due in large part to Maine’s confusing, regressive and unstable solar policy. Three issues, in particular, hampered us.\First, the arbitrary limit of 10 subscribers that can participate in a community solar project made it difficult to achieve economies of scale, especially since low- and moderate-income households tend to be more frugal users of electricity than more affluent consumers.\Second, many local small businesses owners are being excluded from accessing solar power through the state’s current net metering policy. They pay less for actual kilowatt hours used, but are often faced with excessive and expensive “demand charges” that are not compensated for through current net-metering policy, thus making solar energy cost-prohibitive. Solar energy is a great way for Maine businesses to control energy costs and we should make that transition easier, not more difficult.\Third, many potential investors were justifiably wary of the project due to the lack of consistent policy. The cap on participants, which limited the project size, also limited their projected return on investment.\LD 1711, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Dana Dow, would lift the cap for community solar participants to 200. It would also create an opt-in pilot project for non-residential customers, including our local businesses, that would provide monetary credits as an alternative to net-metering. Finally, it provides specific targets for expanding access to low and moderate income families, so we can provide all Mainers, regardless of their income, the opportunity to take advantage of the clean, affordable energy they so desire and deserve.\Now is the time for bold, transformational leadership to propel Maine to the forefront of the much-needed transition to a stable, prosperous, ecology-based economy with living wages and a tenable future for generations to come. By enabling Mainers to become more energy independent, Sen. Dow’s solar bill is an important step in the right direction.\We can and must do this. Maine has the resources and ingenuity to help lead this clean energy transition and the clock is ticking. Please join CEBE in supporting this critical piece of legislation. There is a public hearing for LD 1711 scheduled for Thursday May 16.\The time is now and now is our time.\  Scott Vlaun is executive director for the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy in Norway."
329,"something's happening with the solar bill. or not.\Gov. Paul LePage vetoed a landmark solar energy bill Wednesday, after failed attempts by Democratic leadership to reach a compromise during extensive negotiations. \Solar advocates now plan to press lawmakers to override the veto when they reconvene Friday. \Rep. Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, the assistant majority leader, said a request by the governor to cap at a very low level the price that homeowners receive for solar power they generate was a deal breaker. \""That would have tanked this market immediately,"" she said. \The controversy centered on ""net metering,"" the state rule by which utility companies provide a one-to-one credit to home customers for solar power they generate and feed back into the grid. The credit is based on the retail price of power. \Net metering rules across the country are under fire by politicians and utility representatives, who say the price amounts to a subsidy that's forced on all utility customers. In Maine, however, the bill was supported by Central Maine Power and Emera Maine. \According to Gideon, LePage asked for a price cap that would have started at 10 cents per kilowatt hour and declined in 18 months to the standard offer price for energy supply, which is around 6 cents. By comparison, the retail price, which includes energy and distribution charges, is around 12 cents in southern Maine. \Democrats and their allies, which include environmental groups and many small businesses, have been trying to gain support for a bill that would increase the use of solar energy in Maine, which lags behind other northeastern states. \The Legislature approved the measure last week after changes were made to better insulate utility customers from rate increases. But the margin of support falls short of the two-thirds majority needed to overturn the veto by the governor, a frequent critic of Maine's renewable energy policies. \The bill aims to add 196 megawatts of solar energy to the state's energy portfolio over the next four years, down from the 248 megawatts called for in the original version. Maine has roughly 20 megawatts of installed solar energy today. It also would replace net metering for new solar customers with a complicated, alternative system involving hourly metering and the Public Utilities Commission entering into long-term contracts. \BACKERS WANT INDUSTRY BOOST \Supporters argue that the bill would provide a much-needed boost in Maine to an industry that is thriving elsewhere and stands to add as many as 650 jobs, while protecting 300 current jobs. \But Republican critics dismiss the bill as another policy that will force all electric ratepayers to help subsidize the solar energy systems of the wealthy households that can afford to install them. Throughout the debate, critics have portrayed the initiative as largely benefiting wealthier areas of southern Maine at the expense of ratepayers in poorer, more rural areas, where solar energy systems are less common. \In his veto letter, LePage said the bill would increase energy prices for homes and businesses that cannot afford solar panels ""by tens of millions of dollars - picking winners and losers in Maine's energy mix."" He said the bill would only increase the cost of doing business in Maine, adding that he has heard from executives at companies such as Bath Iron Works, Barber Foods and Pratt-Whitney ""imploring us to lower the cost of energy."" \""I tried to negotiate in good faith with Democrats to reach a compromise that would not add to the burden of ratepayers,"" LePage wrote. ""I requested that the bill include all renewables, return all renewable energy credits (RECs) to ratepayers and have a cap on the price we pay in long-term contracts. We could not reach an agreement. They are not serious about reducing the price of energy for Maine families or job creators."" \TWO EARLIER CONCESSIONS GIVEN \Gideon said the governor asked for, and received, two earlier concessions in the bill. One would have opened up the PUC contract process to other renewable energy sources, not just solar. Another would have used the above-market value of renewable energy credits for so-called stranded costs, expenses that customers pay on their bills for past investments in power plants. \Clean energy advocates said they weren't happy about either of those compromises, but went along with Gideon in hopes of persuading the governor to support the bill in some form. But the price cap request, they said, would have killed the existing solar industry. \""The governor's final request,"" said Vaughan Woodruff, owner of Insource Renewables in Pittsfield, ""was a deal breaker because it sought to eliminate the solar industry that currently exists in Maine by undercutting the value that solar customers provide to the grid."" \Woodruff said he already has had to lay off two workers because of the uncertainty surrounding the bill. \He called on legislators to override the governor's veto. \""This bill does exactly what many of them championed during their campaigns,"" he said, ""creating good-paying Maine jobs, reducing energy prices, and making Maine companies more competitive."" \Dylan Voorhees, clean energy director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine, indicated that the outcome wasn't surprising because LePage had threatened to veto the bill all along. \""This bill represents the very best of people working together to find solutions and common ground,"" he said. ""We don't often see such diverse interests align to do something that benefits jobs, consumers and the environment.""

""Good policy translates into good projects. Solar is making money now, and this initiative would enable economies of scale that just aren't allowed right now.""\The three municipal energy priorities would:\[bullet] Revise net metering rules to allow municipal solar arrays that exceed the current 660-kilowatt limit and have more than nine off-site meters or users, among other changes.\[bullet] Update Maine's Uniform Building and Energy Code so cities and towns can develop so-called stretch codes, which phase in stricter requirements for energy-efficient construction and move communities toward net-zero buildings that produce as much energy as they use.\[bullet] Streamline access to building energy-use data by aggregating utility accounts in a building and providing the data to building owners through an easy-to-use web portal. This would help cities such as South Portland and Portland that have adopted benchmarking ordinances to gauge energy consumption in buildings and provide incentives to make them more energy-efficient.\Buildings account for 40 percent of all energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the New Building Institute. Maine is a major contributor, with some of the oldest housing stock and most inefficient heating systems in the nation, Rosenbach said.\Trying to do its part, South Portland has adopted an ambitious climate action plan that calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent citywide by 2050 and running municipal operations 100 percent on clean energy by 2040.\The city's effort to form a municipal coalition comes at a critical time in state, national and international politics. Since President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the U.N. Paris Agreement on climate change in 2017, 16 states and Puerto Rico have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, staying committed to the agreement's goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.\In Maine, the fledgling municipal coalition anticipates a pending shift in leadership and energy policy at the State House now that Mills, a Democrat, has replaced two-term Republican Gov. Paul LePage and Democrats now control both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\While LePage espoused the need to lower energy costs, he railed against solar and wind energy and successfully blocked three bills meant to promote solar installations.\He was especially critical of net metering, a billing practice that pays homeowners with rooftop solar for excess electricity they send to the grid. The Maine Public Utilities Commission ruled to phase out the practice, which is now tied up in court. LePage said the practice forces lower-income Mainers to subsidize the solar installations of wealthier Mainers.\Mills, by comparison, made climate action and renewable energy top priorities of her campaign, calling for an ambitious goal to reduce Maine's climate-warming pollution 80 percent by 2030. The current state goal is to reduce emissions 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.\In her inaugural address last week, Mills said her administration would ""embrace"" clean energy, promote alternative transportation modes and building weatherization, and set a goal to get 50 percent of Maine's electricity from renewable resources.\""These actions will create good-paying jobs, preserve our environment, and welcome young people to build a green future here in Maine,"" Mills said.\ ""And, by the way, when you drive by the Blaine House in the next few weeks, look for the new solar panels that we are going to install!""\Mills also has said she supports strengthening net metering. Solar supporters and Democratic lawmakers are expected to resubmit a legislative fix that LePage repeatedly vetoed. And she supports changing regulations to allow larger municipal solar projects that serve more users.\""I'm really hoping Janet Mills is going to fix that,"" Darling said, noting that Falmouth is developing plans for a municipal solar array on its former landfill.\South Portland took a major step toward its own climate action goals in October 2017, when it started operating a solar array consisting of 2,944 photovoltaic panels installed on a 34-acre former landfill off Highland Avenue.\At the time, it was the largest municipal solar array in the state, expected to generate 1.2 million kilowatt-hours of energy per year, roughly 12 percent of the electricity used by the city's municipal and school buildings.\South Portland developed the solar facility in partnership with neighboring Portland, which started operating a similar facility last month on its former landfill off Ocean Avenue.\The two cities already are working together on various projects to address shared sustainability concerns and anticipated climate change impacts on Casco Bay and Portland Harbor, including a plan to respond to sea-level rise resulting from global warming.\Portland's participation in the municipal coalition would be a natural extension of an existing partnership, said Troy Moon, Portland's sustainability coordinator.\""We already share many of the same goals,"" Moon said. ""The more municipalities can work together to affect policy at the state level, the more successful we will be.""\Credit: By KELLEY BOUCHARD Portland Press Herald"

Berry and other Democrats thought they could clarify the language, by using L.D. 1373 as a template for a new amendment.\This turned out to be a mistake. LePage's Republican allies skillfully used the amendment bill to sow doubt about solar.\House Republican Leader Ken Fredette rose and said he was confused.

As climate change threatens Maine's economy and way of life in countless ways, it is vital that we embrace and encourage new forms of energy production. Energy independence and stronger local economies can be achieved here in Maine with the encouragement and security of more homegrown renewable energy.
\
Solar power can be generated in every Maine town, urban or rural; the fuel is free, does not pollute our environment and creates jobs by putting folks to work installing solar panels. Above all, it fixes costs for all ratepayers, specifically in a volatile, fossil-fuel driven energy market.
\
The technology for rooftop solar panels is mature and reliable, resulting in systems that are expected to work for 40 to 50 years even in New England's tough climate. Maine industries such as fishing, tourism, and farming rely on a clean, healthy environment, and close to 75 percent of Mainers support renewable energy.
\
Distributed rooftop solar power is increasingly seen as a way to limit high costs of the transmission and distribution of electricity, which are a driving force behind rising electric rates for Mainers. A recent solar study conducted by the Maine Public Utilities Commission concludes that the value of solar electricity is enormous -- twice what current solar customers are credited by the utility. Solar electricity reduces the need to develop and install new fossil fuel power plants and is a cost-competitive solution to any further infrastructure development.
\
Best of all, solar is most effective during the times when the grid is most stressed, on hot summer days when air conditioners hum across Maine. Net metering allows homeowners and businesses to store excess power on the grid and build up their ""credits"" during our long, sunny summer days. These banked credits then are used to offset future power usage any time the sun is not shinning.
\
Additionally, a new community-based option is also available. For many folks, the optimal orientation, sun exposure and roof pitch is not achievable on their limited roof space or specific site.
\
In these instances, with the adoption of community solar farms, neighbors can come together and build their own shared solar array. A community solar farm, or solar garden, is a cooperatively owned solar array that produces clean solar power and feeds it into the grid as a dedicated electric service.
\
Up to nine individuals can join a community solar farm and own a portion of the electricity that is produced. The electricity then is credited directly to the customers' bills through net metering. Community solar farms have been built since the early 2000s; however, in the last few years as the cost of solar power has become increasingly competitive with traditional energy, the development of community solar farms has taken off.
\
Community solar farms can be found in Colorado, Massachusetts, Vermont, Florida, California and Utah, as well as many countries around the globe. Maine's first community solar farm was built by, and is owned and managed by ReVision Energy. Operational since autumn of 2014, the project was built on an old chicken barn in Paris.
\
Anyone can join a community solar farm, the concept of which is to empower individuals, neighborhoods and communities to come together as a collective group. The community solar farm lease is designed for homes that are not well-situated for solar panels or for customers who, for any reason, would prefer a system that is not on their own roof. Anyone whose meter is in Central Maine Power territory can join community solar farm. The only requirement for membership is that the homeowner be a CMP customer.
\
One of the great advantages of a shared solar array is that the investment is portable. Renters or homeowners who are considering moving within the region can still invest in solar and take that investment with them when they move, so long as they stay within CMP's utility territory. And, if they move outside of CMP's territory, they can sell their shares, which are entirely transferable.
\
A community solar farm is a true shared-ownership project. The system, owned by a mutual-benefit nonprofit corporation, is set up by and for its members, who own the solar asset in proportion to their investment. The association also governs the maintenance and operation of the system in perpetuity.
\
As tools and resources such as these and other new energy opportunities make their way into Maine communities, it increasingly is time for neighbors to gather together to build their own community solar farm in the Kennebec Valley.
\

She was forced to put the House into recess for 18 minutes while she consulted Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure, the official parliamentary guidebook. \No one knew that the seed for Malaby's diatribe was planted months ago, by a LePage energy adviser with a long history of undermining solar. \When the vote finally came, solar supporters failed by three votes to get the two-thirds majority needed to override the governor's veto. \Malaby's speech is being cited as an example of how tactics, including his out-of-the-blue comments, an alleged misinformation campaign by Central Maine Power and a strategic legislative blunder, combined to create confusion and defeat the solar lobby for a second year in a row. In the aftermath, some solar advocates say facts fell victim to politics. \""Facts do matter and they will eventually prevail,"" said James Cote, a lobbyist who represents an alliance of solar installers. ""But we're in a pretty toxic environment with solar policy and anything with the word 'solar' in it."" \The vote has created more uncertainty in Maine's solar industry, which employs about 500 people, and keeps Maine in the back of the pack of states developing solar power as a means of energy independence. Solar advocates have also filed a lawsuit, challenging the state's authority to phase out existing solar incentives. \Solar power generation has been growing nationally by double digits, driven in part by renewable energy mandates in states such as California and Massachusetts. But growth has been stunted in Maine, which lacks state incentives and has a governor who is hostile to an energy source he sees as shifting costs onto other electric customers. \Last year, a bill was introduced that aimed to update net metering, a 1990s rule that gives panel owners a 100 percent credit for the retail value of excess power they feed back into the electric grid. It passed, but lawmakers failed to override LePage's veto by two votes. \This year, after another expansive solar bill ran into opposition, supporters tried a scaled-back approach. L.D. 1504 sought to keep current net metering laws in place while the Public Utilities Commission - which had enacted its own rule to gradually phase out net metering - did a cost-benefit study. \But solar supporters never got buy-in from CMP. To the contrary, Maine's largest utility doubled down. \On July 18, Sara Burns, CMP's president and chief executive, wrote a column published in the Portland Press Herald that asserted incentives for rooftop solar owners could add $150 million to customer bills through 2035. That and other factors led lawmakers to put off a planned vote on the veto override, when they first convened to consider outstanding bills on July 20. \Solar supporters accused Burns of scare tactics, and she later acknowledged that her $150 million figure reflected a worst-case scenario. It contradicted estimates from the Maine Office of the Public Advocate that the bill would actually provide customers with a modest savings. But the column had its desired effect: It made some lawmakers who had supported the solar bill think twice. \A CONTROVERSIAL AMENDMENT \The blur of competing facts formed a backdrop on Aug. 2, when lawmakers returned to finally end the longest legislative session in state history. Facing decisions on major public issues such as cellphone use while driving and the legal age for buying cigarettes, the House was asked to consider a new solar bill few members had heard of. \L.D. 1373 had been introduced earlier this year by Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham. It began life as an environmental activist wish list of incentives and rebates, but could never win enough support to move ahead. \On Aug. 2, the bill was reborn as a vehicle to fix a perceived problem. Emera Maine, which serves electric customers in northern and eastern Maine, had raised concerns about legal language in the solar bill. Berry and other Democrats thought they could clarify the language, by using L.D. 1373 as a template for a new amendment. \This turned out to be a mistake. LePage's Republican allies skillfully used the amendment bill to sow doubt about solar. \House Republican Leader Ken Fredette rose and said he was confused. The solar bill had been vetoed by the governor, he pointed out. But now comes an amendment, which has been turned into a new bill, on the last day of the session, which hasn't gone through the committee process and which he hadn't seen until five minutes ago. \""A bill that amends a bill that the chief executive has vetoed,"" Fredette said, sounding exasperated. \Minutes later, Rep. Beth O'Connor, R-Berwick, took the floor. A member of the committee that handles energy issues and a critic of renewable energy subsidies, she said she couldn't possibly understand the amendment bill in five minutes. Her voice rising in anger, O'Connor called the bill a desperate attempt to just pass something. \Berry then rose to apologize for any confusion. The amendment, he said, was just two sentences. It didn't change any current practices, just clarified how rooftop solar owners are compensated. \But when a vote was called at the urging of Republicans, the House voted 73-64 to indefinitely postpone the amendment. \Cote, the solar lobbyist, said his side didn't have time to explain the measure to lawmakers. \""We thought it made sense,"" he said. ""It was meant to be an olive branch. But it was easy at that point for opponents to take it and just confuse the issue even further."" \THE IMPACT OF DOUBT \Confusion intensified later that afternoon, when the solar bill came up. \Gideon was caught off guard by Rep. Malaby's contention that the House had no standing to consider the bill. In his view, the bill redistributed funds, which amounted to a tax on non-solar users. He thought that was unconstitutional, based on wording in Maine law and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the individual mandate for health insurance, which he read aloud. \Masking her displeasure, Gideon replied that Malaby had presented a well thought-out argument ""that took some time for someone to put together."" After reviewing the parliamentary rules, though, she determined the House could proceed. \But this unexpected debate over whether the solar bill was a tax gave Republicans new ammunition. Fredette rose to say that the tax question, combined with the failure of L.D. 1373, exposed the ""gaping hole"" in L.D. 1504. \Rep. Heather Sirocki, R-Scarborough, agreed, saying she found Malaby's argument ""compelling."" Then she said she would ""share a few words from Sara Burns,"" and began reading passages from the CMP chief's July 18 newspaper column, repeating the disputed projection of a $150 million hit to ratepayers. \Democrats tried to quell the growing rebellion. A member of the energy committee, Rep. Heather Sanborn, D-Portland, calmly listed the limited steps that would be taken under the bill. Rep. Janice Cooper, D-Yarmouth, urged members not to be sidetracked by a false argument, and emphasized that the bill contained no taxes. \But the tide had already turned. While the veto override easily passed in the Senate, 28-6, it failed in the House, 88-48, three votes short of the two-thirds majority needed. Fourteen House members were absent from the vote, and seven Republicans who initially supported the measure changed their positions. \In an interview last week, Malaby said he got the idea for his speech months ago from one of LePage's energy advisers, Jim LaBrecque, a vocal opponent of solar energy. Malaby said he first thought the analogy between provisions of the solar bill and the Affordable Care Act was ""crazy."" But LaBrecque persisted, providing him with appeals court rulings meant to back the claim. \Then, while watching a Red Sox game in mid-July, Malaby said something jogged his memory and led him to get on the internet and do his own research. What he learned formed the basis of his speech to the House, he said. \""I think I swayed a few Republicans who voted against the bill, because they are more constitutionally oriented,"" Malaby said. ""I think it made a difference."" \After the vote, solar supporters were left trying to sort out what happened. \""What's so frustrating is, it's not about policy,"" said Chris Rauscher, public policy director for Sunrun Inc., a top national rooftop installer that lobbied for the Maine bill. ""This is complicated stuff. So it's disingenuous to inject (misinformation) into the debate. The best way to kill a bill like this is to inject more doubt.""

340,"From bans on plastic bags and Styrofoam containers to boosts for solar and other renewable energy, the climate in the Maine Legislature this session was decidedly pro-environment.\Pro-envirnonmental push by lawmakers includes energy, bans\ \LEWISTON — As he loaded plastic bags full of groceries into his car, Roger Potvin said he was in favor of banning them.\“I hate them,” he said, adding that so much plastic “is stupid. You hear about how they hurt the fish in the ocean all the time.”\Outlawing plastic grocery bags is good, the Lewiston resident said, “because if they’re not around, we won’t use them. The problem is, they’re so convenient. But we don’t need them. We can bring our own bags.”\The Maine Legislature this year passed a law banning the bags. It will take effect on Earth Day — April 22 — in 2020. The ban was supported by the Maine Grocers Association and the Maine Retail Association, in part out of concern that various municipal bans would make compliance difficult. Retailers wanted consistency.\Consumers are becoming aware “that plastic pollution is big,” said Pete Didisheim, of the Natural Resources Council of Maine. Worldwide, about 1 million plastic bags are distributed per minute.\“We use those bags for five minutes,” Didisheim said. “Then the plastic lasts for hundreds of years.”\Overall, this recently ended legislative session was a big win for the environment.\Legislators passed a host of new laws that boosted solar and other renewable-energy production, encouraged the use of heat pumps, sought to improve recycling and reduce materials harmful to the environment and health, and strove to reduce climate change pollution. A ban on Styrofoam food containers begins in 2021.\In her State of the State address in February, Gov. Janet Mills said the environment and fighting climate change were a priority for her, and that her administration was working on a climate agenda. Without using additional tax dollars, she pledged, the state would help with the research and development of offshore wind power, provide incentives for community and residential solar power, promote energy efficiency and weatherization, increase the use of heat pumps, build charging stations for and create incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles, and help local and state governments become more “green.”\All of that, and more, happened after that address.\Since then, Maine has joined the U.S. Climate Alliance and withdrawn from the Outer Continental Shelf Governors Coalition, which wanted to drill offshore for oil and gas. Mills has announced that Maine will create the Maine Offshore Wind Initiative, a state-based effort to identify offshore wind development in the Gulf of Maine, and will work to develop offshore wind power with New Hampshire and Massachusetts in a federally led Gulf of Maine Intergovernmental Regional Task Force.\This has environmentalists giddy.\“This was the best year for the environment in a generation,” Didisheim said. “I’ve been here 23 years. It’s the most productive legislative session on environmental policy that I have seen.”\Maine’s new laws signal that the state is “moving strongly towards renewable energy, reducing carbon pollution created by energy, creating more clean energy jobs and keeping more money in our pockets instead of sending it out of state for fossil fuel,” he said.\For decades, Maine has been a leader in protecting the environment, Didisheim said. “It’s only been in the last eight years that has been put on pause. There’s been too much partisanship” and too many efforts to weaken existing regulations, from Maine’s bottle bill to protective shoreland zoning.\“We’ve seen in this session a return to the normal path of lawmakers working to protect the character of Maine,” he said.\Environmentalist Silver Moore-Leamon, of Auburn, called the Legislature’s work this session “a breath of fresh air after the last eight years of government rancor.”\She’s especially pleased with the passage of L.D. 1431, a law that will help municipal recycling programs by having the state work with retail and packaging manufacturers to reduce packaging and pick up some of the cost of recycling.\While many many agree with lawmakers’ reasons for banning some plastic, it doesn’t mean they’ll stop using single-use bags before the deadline. \On a recent shopping trip to Auburn, Loreena Lindberg of Winthrop was pushing her cart filled with groceries in plastic bags. Well-aware that on April 22, 2020, the plastic bags will no longer be available, she grinned and said, “I’m saving them.”\“Yes, I agree with no plastic bags,” Lindberg said. “They say they’re bad for the environment. They fly around. They never dissolve.”\As an independent voter and citizen who worries about plastic pollution and other environmental hazards, Greg D’Augustine, of Greene, said he was disappointed that L.D. 640, a bill that would have examined the climate impact of a proposed CMP transmission line from Quebec through Maine to Massachusetts, was rejected.\He was pleased to see passage of the bill making Maine the first state to ban plastic foam.\From an environmental perspective, this session wasn’t perfect, D’Augustine said. “However, it went way beyond anything we’ve seen under the last administration. The governor and Legislature deserve a round of applause for a job well done.”\Highlights of environmental laws passed by state lawmakers in the recent session include:\• L.D. 289, sponsored by Rep. Stanley Ziegler, D-Montville, bans plastic foam food packaging, from coffee cups to clam-shell-shaped containers. Plastic foam is not recyclable and contaminates recycling streams. It is now banned in 15 Maine towns, including Freeport.\• L.D. 955 bans offshore drilling in Maine. It was sponsored by Rep. Michael Devin, D-Newcastle.\• L.D. 1711, sponsored by Sen. Dana Dow, R-Waldoboro, will promote solar energy significantly. The law creates two incentives, one for commercial and institutional organizations, another for community-shared projects. It lifts a previous cap that limited how many people could buy into a community solar farm, expanding solar power access for low- and moderate-income Mainers. The effort is expected to create 500 jobs by expanding solar power projects to homes, businesses, municipalities and schools.\• L.D. 1679, sponsored by Mills, directs the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to reduce carbon pollution by 80% by 2050, a goal consistent with the Paris Accord.\• L.D. 91, sponsored by Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, restores net metering for solar power, which will allow consumers who generate more solar power electricity than they need to send that power to the grid and get credit for it.\• L.D. 1431, sponsored by Rep. Michael Devin, D-Newcastle, will help municipal recycling programs. The new law directs the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to work with producers of packaging to reduce packaging and solid waste and have them help pay for municipal recycling programs. The DEP must report back to lawmakers with recommendations in December.\• L.D. 1766, sponsored by Mills, aims to increase the number of heat pumps in use in Maine by 100,000 — doubling the total number in use — in the next five years through more financial incentives, especially for lower-income households. The law takes effect in September.\“We are reviewing the law to develop a thoughtful strategy for how to achieve the goal,” said Michael Stoddard, of Efficiency Maine. The state plans to “make Maine No. 1 in the nation on a per-capita basis for lowering heating costs.”\• L.D. 1739, sponsored by Rep. Jessica Fay, D-Raymond, reduces toxins in food packaging by prohibiting the sale of food packaging with phthalates, or PFAs, which are considered “forever” chemicals because they don’t break down in the environment. PFAs are coming under increasing scrutiny in Maine and across the nation because of health concerns and because they have been found in sludge used by farms as fertilizer. A recent Food and Drug Administration test found substantial levels of PFAs in grocery store meats, seafood and other foods.\During the legislative session, Mills also announced an initiative by her administration to use $5.1 million from a settlement with Volkswagen to develop new Efficiency Maine programs that would provide rebates for the purchase of electric cars and the installation of electric car chargers across Maine."
341,"I just read the Maine Voices column on solar power, written by Barbara Alexander, former director of the Consumer Assistance Division of the Maine Public Utilities Commission. She claims your recent editorial of Sept. 18 was ""based on incorrect facts and . . . did not examine the real issue with net metering."" \I felt your editorial was one of the clearest articles I have read about this issue. I am a person who owns a solar array and uses net metering. I paid upfront for that array. A partial federal credit for my installation is available to me and I will take advantage of it. I currently receive credit (no money) for excess electricity I generate. That excess energy goes to the grid and is used by other electric customers. During times when my array does not generate all the electricity I need, I can access the credits I have accumulated for up to a year. I lose those credits if I have not used them within a year of when they were generated. Even during months in which I generate all the power I use, I pay delivery charges to my power company. \My electricity is generated by a renewable resource that does not pollute our environment. These are my facts. I don't see how I am being ""subsidized by lower-incomed customers,"" as claimed in the Oct. 2 article. In fact, it appears to me that all electric customers are subsidizing the construction of large electric plants that depend on fossil fuels and emit many pollutants into our atmosphere. \Electric companies need to look more closely at how they do business, because things need to change. I know there will be losses in this process, but an opportunity exists to access cleaner power that doesn't rape our world in the making. There is only one truth here. Let's stop approaching the issue with information that is manipulated to divide groups and distort the facts."

The governor and Legislature deserve a round of applause for a job well-done.”\Highlights of environmental laws passed by state lawmakers in the recent session include:\<img class=""size-medium wp-image-6904493"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/IMG_3856.jpg?resize=218%2C300&ssl=1"" alt="""" width=""218"" height=""300"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" />\LD 289, sponsored by Rep. Stanley Ziegler, D-Montville, bans plastic foam food packaging, from coffee cups to clam-shell-shaped containers. Plastic foam is not recyclable and contaminates recycling streams. It is now banned in 15 Maine towns, including Freeport.\LD 955 bans offshore drilling in Maine. It was sponsored by Rep. Michael Devin, D-Newcastle.\LD 1711 will significantly promote solar energy It is sponsored by Sen. Dana Dow, R-Waldoboro. The bill creates two incentives, one for commercial and institutional organizations, another for community-shared projects. It lifts a previous cap that limited how many people could buy into a community solar farm, expanding solar power access for low- and moderate-income Mainers. The effort is expected to create 500 jobs by expanding solar power projects to homes, businesses, municipalities and schools.\LD 1679, sponsored by Mills, directs the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to reduce carbon pollution by 80% by 2050, a goal consistent with the Paris Accord.\LD 91, sponsored by Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, restores net metering for solar power, which will allow consumers who generate more solar power electricity than they need to send that power to the grid and get credit for it.\LD 1431, sponsored by Rep. Michael Devin, D-Newcastle, will help municipal recycling programs. The new law directs the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to work with producers of packaging to reduce packaging and solid waste, and have them help pay for municipal recycling programs. The DEP must report back to lawmakers with recommendations in December.\LD 1766, sponsored by Mills, aims to increase the number of heat pumps in use in Maine by 100,000 — doubling the total number in use — in the next five years through more financial incentives, especially for lower-income households. The law takes effect in September.\“We are reviewing the law to develop a thoughtful strategy for how to achieve the goal,” said Michael Stoddard of Efficiency Maine. The state plans to “make Maine No. 1 in the nation on a per-capita basis for lowering heating costs.”\<img class=""size-medium wp-image-6904365"" src=""https://i2.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/IMG_3855.jpg?resize=300%2C233&ssl=1"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""233"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" />\LD 1739, sponsored by Rep. Jessica Fay, D-Raymond, reduces toxins in food packaging by prohibiting the sale of food packaging with phthalates, or PFAs, which are considered “forever” chemicals because they don’t break down in the environment. PFAs are coming under increasing scrutiny in Maine and across the nation because of health concerns and because they have been found in sludge used by farms as fertilizer. A recent Food and Drug Administration test found substantial levels of PFAs in grocery store meats, seafood and other foods.\During the legislative session Mills also announced an initiative by her administration to use $5.1 million from a settlement with Volkswagen to develop new Efficiency Maine programs that would provide rebates for the purchase of electric cars and the installation of electric car chargers across Maine."
343,"Maine's largest environmental organization pledged Wednesday to ""pursue every opportunity to overturn"" controversial solar energy rules adopted by the Public Utilities Commission.\AUGUSTA -- Maine's largest environmental organization pledged Wednesday to ""pursue every opportunity"" to reverse controversial solar energy rules adopted by the state Public Utilities Commission. \In late-January, the PUC approved new rules changing ""net metering"" policies that provide homeowners with credits on their electricity bills for excess solar energy they feed back into the grid. Under the new rules, which were finalized Wednesday, homeowners who already have solar panels can continue to receive credit at the full retail rate for the power they produce for 15 years. Those who install solar energy systems in 2018 or later would see the credits gradually reduced over time. \The PUC's changes were strongly criticized by installation companies and environmental groups, as well as by Gov. Paul LePage, a critic of the state's renewable energy policies. \On Wednesday, the Natural Resources Council of Maine denounced the three-member PUC for adopting ""some of the most extreme anti-solar elements in the nation."" Dylan Voorhees, NRCM's climate and clean energy director, predicted the rules will ""stifle investment in clean, local, solar power"" and accused the commission of adopting the rules without analyzing the costs and benefits of net metering. \""NRCM will pursue every opportunity to overturn the PUC's extreme anti-solar rules,"" Voorhees said in a written statement. ""The best and swiftest solution is for the Legislature to enact an effective law to move Maine forward this session, before these extreme rules take effect at the end of 2017. The Legislature should be setting solar policy in Maine, not the PUC. With others, NRCM is also likely to file a 'motion for reconsideration' with the PUC, giving them one last chance to set aside these extreme changes."" \However, it is unclear whether such a bill could pass the Legislature and become law. The PUC took up the issue after the Legislature fell two votes short last year of overriding LePage's veto of a bill to revamp Maine's solar policy. Both the House and Senate are even more closely divided this year than during the 2016 legislative session. \The Conservation Law Foundation also expressed its disapproval of the new rules. \""Imagine you make the decision to save money by using a clothesline rather than a dryer, but at the end of the month you are billed for the energy you saved,"" Sean Mahoney, director of the foundation's Maine Advocacy Center, said in a written statement. ""That's what the PUC has just done to every family and business that uses solar power. Revoking the incentive structure alone would have been outrageous, but to go one step further and actually charge us for electricity we're not buying is downright criminal."" \LePage, meanwhile, also has railed against a PUC decision that he insists will force all ratepayers to continue subsidizing installations of solar energy systems on private homes. Last month, LePage even called for the resignations of the three commissioners, Mark Vannoy, Bruce Williamson and Carlisle McLean. \""I will tell you, and I make no bones about it, I am enormously disappointed in the PUC,"" LePage said during a Feb. 10 news conference. ""Those were all appointments that I have made. I thought that they understood that my only request, my only request on energy was this: Lower the cost and do no harm to the environment."" \LePage cannot remove commissioners, but will soon have an opportunity to nominate someone to replace McLean, who formerly served as his chief legal counsel and natural resources adviser. McLean's term ends this month. Kevin Miller can be contacted at 791-6312 or at: kmiller@mainetoday.com Twitter: KevinMillerPPH\Credit: By KEVIN MILLER Staff Writer"

345,"For the third time in two years, Gov. Paul LePage is pitting Republican lawmakers against the best interests of the state. If Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives sustain his veto of common sense solar legislation, they will be responsible for raising electricity costs for all Maine ratepayers. This is a steep price to pay for political loyalty.\Instead, the prudent thing to do is to override LePage's veto of legislation that will not raise electric rates, while also ensuring the continued growth of an industry that is benefiting Maine and its environment. A strong majority in the House and Senate have already voted this way once. House Republicans shouldn't be intimidated into changing their votes.\The bill in question, an amended version of LD 1444, does two simple things. First, it negates complex and unneeded rules from the Public Utilities Commission. The PUC rules direct utilities to assess transmission and distribution fees on power generated by homeowners and others who generate electricity on their premises for their own use and sell the excess into the power grid. The fee will be charged on power that never leaves the home or business where it is generated, a huge windfall to electric utilities.\The rules went into effect on March 16, but the PUC has already waived them for dozens of new solar installations in Maine.\To calculate these new charges, new meters would need to be installed at every solar-generating location that sells power to the grid. These meters would measure the power generated, while existing meters would measure the amount of power used at these locations, including homes. Each meter costs $500 -- a cost that would be spread among all utility ratepayers in Maine. The PUC rules does not take advantage of smart meters that already have been installed in Maine, at ratepayer expense.\To collect such a charge, utility companies will have to update their billing systems and install new meters, which all ratepayers would have to pay for as part of their electric bills.\Late in last year's legislative session, lawmakers came close to fixing this ludicrous situation by overwhelmingly passing a bill that would have given the PUC until 2019 to come up with better rules for compensating residents and businesses that generate more solar energy than they need and sell it to the electricity grid, without requiring two meters. LePage vetoed the bill and, after heavy lobbying from CMP, several lawmakers who had voted in favor of the bill voted to sustain the veto.\In 2016, the Legislature passed a bipartisan bill to update the state's rules around solar power generation. LePage vetoed that legislation. When it came time for the override vote, many House Republicans reversed their earlier support for the legislation and voted to uphold LePage's veto. Six lawmakers literally took a walk and did not vote on it, allowing LePage's veto to stand.\Republican lawmakers shouldn't take this path again.\In this year's veto message on LD 1444, LePage repeated untrue accusations that net metering, the current system of compensating small power generators, ""subsidize energy installations of the affluent on the backs of hard-working Mainers who can least afford higher electricity bills.""\In fact, the PUC found that all ratepayers are benefiting from the solar energy contributed to the grid by net metering customers. Another analysis found that the new charges would generate about $60,000 per year. The costs to capture that revenue would be about $3 million per year. That is a very bad tradeoff.\The second thing LD 1444 would do is increase the number of entities that can participate in a community solar project from 10 to 50, well below the 200 CMP said was feasible. This will spur growth of community-based solar installation, such as on capped landfills.\The legislation offers a much more prudent approach than raising costs for all Maine utilities customers because the governor objects to alternative energy. The Senate overrode LePage's veto on Monday. The House should do so as well.\Follow BDN Editorial & Opinion on Facebook for the latest opinions on the issues of the day in Maine.\"

347,"Augusta Public Works has built an electirical generation plant to use the methane coming from giant piles of garbage in Hatch Hill Landfil. CMP will be inspecting today\Hatch Hill to use methane to generate savings on electricity\AUGUSTA — The city is putting its waste to work.\Hatch Hill landfill is nearly ready to start using the methane gas generated by trash buried at the regional facility to power a new generator installed there to create electricity to be fed into the grid. That will generate savings for Augusta’s electric bills.\The $2.4 million system is expected to start generating electricity, likely within a week, once it is fine-tuned and inspected by Central Maine Power to ensure it can feed electricity into the grid safely.\The new system is one of only a few that exist at municipally operated landfills in the country, according to Megan McDevitt, project manager for Woodard and Curran, an engineering firm working on the project for the city.\“It’s a pretty big deal to be a municipally operated gas-to-energy project,” she said. “It’s extremely exciting. I’m anxious to see it switched on.”\The cost of installing the generator and other equipment for the system is expected to be paid back fully by savings it generates in nine years, according to Ralph St. Pierre, Augusta’s finance director and assistant city manager.\The system should be better for the environment, as well, because the landfill has been generating methane gas for years. Years ago, the methane simply escaped into the air; in recent years, it has been collected via an underground system of pipes and burned off by a flare. Now, instead of doing that to limit damage to air quality, the methane will be used for generating electricity.\“This will take that fuel and do something useful with it,” said Eli Ladd, owner of Newtility, as he worked to fine-tune the generator engine and the electronic control panel for the new system Tuesday. \The system is expected to generate about 550 kilowatts per hour. It will feed power into the grid, for which Augusta will be compensated by CMP through a credit toward electricity used at city facilities.\The city plans to use that net metering credit to offset electric bills for Hatch Hill, and the nine city buildings that use the most electricity: City Center, Augusta Civic Center, Cony High School, Capital Area Technical Center, two of the city’s four elementary schools, the police station, Lithgow Public Library and Buker Community Center.\Public Works Director Lesley Jones said net metering makes the project financially feasible. In 2008, she said, the city considered installing a system that would take landfill-produced gas directly to city buildings to make electricity for each of them. It was determined, however, such a method would be too costly, in part because of the cost of moving it from the relatively remote Hatch Hill site to one or more city-owned buildings.\After the nine-year payback period, the system will continue to generate savings for the city.\St. Pierre said Hatch Hill is expected to keep producing methane, and thus be capable of producing electricity, at its current levels for 17 to 20 years, and still could produce enough gas to make electricity in smaller quantities for as many as 30 years.\City councilors approved funding to build the system in March. It will be financed by money generated at Hatch Hill, which is owned by the city but accepts waste from several other area municipalities.\A recently completed project will provide the generator with additional methane gas as more gas collection wells and a plastic cover were added to sections of the landfill not being used now.\A new break room for Hatch Hill workers and an office for a supervisor to oversee the system also are being built and nearing completion. St. Pierre said the total cost of work at Hatch Hill, including costs not directly related to the power generation system, is about $3.6 million.\On Tuesday, Ladd and others worked to ready the system to be connected by a breaker to the CMP grid.\A video graphic on the control panel for the system shows how the system works, with gas captured in the landfill and taken — via 1,700 feet of 8-inch underground pipe — to the system near the entrance to the facility. The untreated gas, Ladd said, comes in contaminated with water, metals and other contaminants, and goes through a dehydration skid where the water is separated from the gas. The water is sent to a leachate pond on the landfill site; and the gas, once it reaches the proper temperature, goes into the new large engine to power the generator.\“What we’re trying to do is take a dirty gas and make it cleaner, to make it acceptable fuel for the generator,” Jones said. “Any day now, we’ll be up and running.”\The Pine Tree Landfill, in Hampden, owned by Casella Waste Systems, installed a system to convert trash to energy in 2008.\The state Department of Environmental Protection approved an air quality license for the project in February. The Augusta Planning Board held a public hearing and approved the project Feb. 13, with a condition of approval requiring noise levels to be checked quarterly to make sure noise from the generators does not exceed the limits of the city’s noise ordinance.\Keith Edwards — 621-5647\kedwards@centralmaine.com\Twitter: @kedwardskj"

349,"PORTLAND, Maine -- In a forum quickly reconfigured after the last-minute withdrawal of Gov. Paul LePage, his challengers for the Blaine House delivered speeches detailing how their energy policies would differ from the governor's and, to a lesser degree, each other's.\The forum was billed as the first major event where all three gubernatorial candidates would be in the same place, talking about the same topic at about the same time to a room of about 275 people, many of whom are involved in policymaking or business related to energy issues.\For Democratic candidate and U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud and independent Eliot Cutler, it was the first time they put their oratory side-by-side, weaving their own fabrics of policy and politics.\Michaud, who took the stage first, focused early on specific decisions he would have made differently than LePage, delivering a familiar criticism of what he called the governor's ""my-way-or-the-highway approach in government.""\""We need to be willing to compromise at times and find common ground and ideas that we can build upon, and that's what's been sorely missing over the last several years in Augusta,"" Michaud said.\He took shots at LePage's decisions during the last four years, including the governor's frequent use of the veto pen and decision to fight for a University of Maine offshore wind project to vie for support from ratepayers as a pilot project. That push led the Norwegian company Statoil to abandon a pilot project in Maine.\""I will continue to support and champion what the university is doing, but I would never have manipulated that support to drive out from the state of Maine the private investment dollars that would have made a huge difference here in the state,"" Michaud said.\In his administration, Michaud said he would encourage the expansion of a range of renewable energy sources, a plan to reduce home heating oil use 50 percent by 2030, expanded charging infrastructure for electric cars and more foreign investment in energy projects.\Cutler, who spoke after Michaud, referenced little from LePage's term in office and delivered a more policy-heavy speech, centered on a five-point plan for changing how energy is priced.\""My guiding principle is to make markets reflect more accurately real costs,"" Cutler said.\That includes the state encouraging the formation of energy service provider companies, or ESCOs, that would work in concert with his proposed Maine Energy Financing Authority to evaluate, plan and finance energy efficiency projects in the state.\His plan also calls for expansion of natural gas pipeline that he said could act as a ""bridge"" to ""more stable and long-term solutions,"" an electricity billing system called net-metering that discounts power users puts back into the grid from their monthly bill, and research into power storage that could retain electricity from fickle renewable sources such as wind, solar and ocean power that are subject to weather patterns.\Both candidates advocated for increased efficiency investments, a move away from fuel oil heating, encouraging more electric vehicles and incorporating a mix of energy solutions playing into the state's power plan.\In a written statement issued near the end of Michaud's on-stage remarks and the start of Cutler's, LePage echoed his stance that the state has to lower electricity costs ""to recruit larger companies and even more good paying jobs to Maine.""\With only the two candidates presenting Friday, Cutler's speech catered more to the audience of energy industry and environmental professionals, speaking about current concepts in the energy sector, such as distributed power generation and net metering. But he did venture into the political as well, taking a jab at Michaud and LePage.\""It's not just about being better than LePage. It's not about wielding the veto pen less and being a nicer person. Those are all pretty low hurdles,"" Cutler said. ""It's about putting someone in charge as governor who can look beyond the next four or eight years and make smart decisions about Maine's long-term future.""\As Cutler and Michaud stumped for support of the 275 assembled on Friday, the Maine Renewable Energy Association announced its endorsement of Michaud shortly after the forum ended, saying ""he has a proven track record of fighting for renewable energy investments"" and praising his Maine Made business and investment plan.\Both candidates spoke for about 15 minutes, leaving another 15 minutes for questions from the audience, a period when the tone of each speech continued with Michaud emphasizing a willingness to deal across party lines to move policy forward and Cutler claiming authority in energy issues.\Cutler asserted that Environment Maine Executive Director Emily Figdor hadn't been listening to his remarks when she asked whether he supported natural gas expansion despite research showing emissions associated with its extraction, transport and other aspects are less favorable.\""Clearly, you either weren't listening to my remarks or you prepared your question before you heard them,"" Cutler said.

AGATHA, Maine -- It's not much to look at right now, just 20 giant poles stuck in the ground in the middle of a northern Maine field, but to Keith LaBrie, it's money in the bank.\By next summer the poles will each support a 15-foot-by-5-foot solar panel array that together LaBrie said will supply 60 percent of this family farm's electrical needs.\LaBrie, along with his brother Duane and son Jacob, grows and stores more than 500 acres of potatoes annually.\""Can you hear that?"" LaBrie said one day last week, standing near the solar site and pointing over his shoulder to the large potato storage shed across the road. ""Those fans run 24-7 from November until March or April.""\Each of the farm's six storage sheds has one of the 7.5 horsepower fans that circulate air and heat around the potatoes as they await shipment.\And each of those fans runs on electricity.\""Right now we are averaging around $35,000 to $36,000 a year in electrical costs,"" LaBrie said. ""Once we sat down and looked at the numbers of going with solar power, we saw that it was not only environmentally sustainable, it's economically feasible, too.""\The 300 solar panels -- 15 to a pole -- are projected to produce a combined 76.5 kilowatts of power annually, taking advantage of what Dale Roy of Maine Solar and Wind, LLC in Fort Kent, said is northern Maine's 4.95-hours of rated sunlight.\""That's a really good number compared to other areas of the state,"" Roy said. ""We have nice, clear days up here and fairly little rain.""\According to Roy, when talking about solar generated electricity, sunlight is rated according to how many hours in a day it can produce maximum wattage over a fixed area on a panel.\And while northern Maine days are short in winter months compared to sunnier spots to the south, Roy said the cool temperatures put the state at an advantage when it comes to producing solar power.\""Solar systems don't like the heat, so the colder the better,"" he said.\The components in the solar panels that produce the electricity are far more efficient the colder it is, Roy said.\And that's good news for LaBrie and his family's farm.\""The solar panels are going to produce 60 percent of the electricity we use for the farm every year,"" he said.\The LaBrie system will be tied to the northern Maine power grid so instead of actually directly supplying electricity to the farm, the power will be purchased by Emera Maine and credited to LaBrie through net metering.\""Emera makes it a great deal,"" LaBrie said. ""The net metering allows me to produce the energy and have it run through a single meter on the farm.""\Susan Faloon, communications supervisor at Emera, said a project like the LaBrie Farms' solar array is good for business, the environment and residents.\""At Emera Maine, we know customers depend on us to power their homes and businesses and to provide solutions for sustainability,"" Faloon said. ""We're working to ensure the grid is the platform that enables customer choice for projects such as [the LaBries'] and we applaud their initiative in becoming a green and sustainable company.""\Elsewhere in the state agricultural operations are using other forms of renewable energy to power their operations.\Stonyvale Farm, a fifth-generation, family-owned dairy farm in Exeter is using an anaerobic digestion system, which turns animal and food wastes into energy.\Cozy Acres Greenhouses in North Yarmouth combines solar and geothermal energy to power its business.\LaBrie said many of the companies in the agricultural world are encouraging farms to become more environmentally sustainable.\""They like to see us being good stewards of the land,"" he said. ""We certainly feel that's important, too.""\LaBrie said he worked with Madawaska's community development director Suzie Paradis to apply for a $50,000 federal USDA Rural Energy for America Program renewable energy grant which he received last summer.\LaBrie said he hopes to begin installing the racks that will hold the panels within the coming weeks but said placing the solar panels will wait until next spring.\""I think we are going to run out of good weather before we can get it all done,"" he said.\Each of the 1,000- pound, 21-foot tall, 8-inch-diameter poles was sunk close to 9-feet into the ground and is secured with a concrete footing, LaBrie said.\Once completed, he said the solar array will be relatively maintenance free.\""We may have to manually reposition the panels four times a year depending on the sun angle,"" he said. ""Other than that, the panels are just there and do their thing making electricity.""\Other than saying it was ""significant,"" LaBrie would not comment on the exact cost of purchasing and installing the solar array on the farm.\He did say the USDA grant covers around 20 percent of the total cost and, when factoring in the available federal tax credits on renewable energy projects, he estimates the project will pay for itself in six or seven years.\If all goes well, LaBrie said he would consider expanding the array to the point it provides 100 percent of the farm's electrical needs.\""Doing this was not really a tough sell when you consider the payback period,"" LaBrie said. ""It was really a no-brainer.""\Credit: Julia Bayly BDN Staff"
351,"Augusta Public Works has built an electirical generation plant to use the methane coming from giant piles of garbage in Hatch Hill Landfil. CMP will be inspecting today\Augusta landfill to use methane gas to generate savings on city’s bills\AUGUSTA — The city is putting its waste to work.\Hatch Hill landfill is nearly ready to start using the methane gas generated by trash buried at the regional facility to power a new generator installed there to create electricity to be fed into the grid. That will generate savings for Augusta’s electric bills.\The $2.4 million system is expected to start generating electricity, likely within a week, once it is fine-tuned and inspected by Central Maine Power to ensure it can feed electricity into the grid safely.\The new system is one of only a few that exist at municipally operated landfills in the country, according to Megan McDevitt, project manager for Woodard and Curran, an engineering firm working on the project for the city.\“It’s a pretty big deal to be a municipally operated gas-to-energy project,” she said. “It’s extremely exciting. I’m anxious to see it switched on.”\The cost of installing the generator and other equipment for the system is expected to be paid back fully by savings it generates in nine years, according to Ralph St. Pierre, Augusta’s finance director and assistant city manager.\The system should be better for the environment, as well, because the landfill has been generating methane gas for years. Years ago, the methane simply escaped into the air; in recent years, it has been collected via an underground system of pipes and burned off by a flare. Now, instead doing that to limit damage to air quality, the methane will be used for generating electricity.\“This will take that fuel and do something useful with it,” said Eli Ladd, owner of Newtility, as he worked to fine-tune the generator engine and the electronic control panel for the new system Tuesday. \The system is expected to generate about 550 kilowatts per hour. It will feed power into the grid, for which Augusta will be compensated by CMP through a credit toward electricity used at city facilities.\The city plans to use that net metering credit to offset electric bills for Hatch Hill, and the nine city buildings that use the most electricity: City Center, Augusta Civic Center, Cony High School, Capital Area Technical Center, two of the city’s four elementary schools, the police station, Lithgow Public Library and Buker Community Center.\Public Works Director Lesley Jones said net metering makes the project financially feasible. In 2008, she said, the city considered installing a system that would take landfill-produced gas directly to city buildings to make electricity for each of them. It was determined, however, such a method would be too costly, in part because of the cost of moving it from the relatively remote Hatch Hill site to one or more city-owned buildings.\After the nine-year payback period, the system will continue to generate savings for the city.\St. Pierre said Hatch Hill is expected to keep producing methane, and thus be capable of producing electricity, at its current levels for 17 to 20 years, and still could produce enough gas to make electricity in smaller quantities for as many as 30 years.\City councilors approved funding to build the system in March. It will be financed by money generated at Hatch Hill, which is owned by the city but accepts waste from several other area municipalities.\A recently completed project will provide the generator with additional methane gas as more gas collection wells and a plastic cover were added to sections of the landfill not being used now.\A new break room for Hatch Hill workers and an office for a supervisor to oversee the system also are being built and nearing completion. St. Pierre said the total cost of work at Hatch Hill, including costs not directly related to the power generation system, is about $3.6 million.\On Tuesday, Ladd and others worked to ready the system to be connected by a breaker to the CMP grid.\A video graphic on the control panel for the system shows how the system works, with gas captured in the landfill and taken — via 1,700 feet of 8-inch underground pipe — to the system near the entrance to the facility. The untreated gas, Ladd said, comes in contaminated with water, metals and other contaminants, and goes through a dehydration skid where the water is separated from the gas. The water is sent to a leachate pond on the landfill site; and the gas, once it reaches the proper temperature, goes into the new large engine to power the generator.\“What we’re trying to do is take a dirty gas and make it cleaner, to make it acceptable fuel for the generator,” Jones said. “Any day now, we’ll be up and running.”\The Pine Tree Landfill, in Hampden, owned by Casella Waste Systems, installed a system to convert trash to energy in 2008.\The state Department of Environmental Protection approved an air quality license for the project in February. The Augusta Planning Board held a public hearing and approved the project Feb. 13, with a condition of approval requiring noise levels to be checked quarterly to make sure noise from the generators does not exceed the limits of the city’s noise ordinance.\Keith Edwards — 621-5647\kedwards@centralmaine.com\Twitter: @kedwardskj"

NORWAY -- While these guys love ""bright, sunshiny days,"" they won't let gray skies keep them down, either.
\
Solar and renewable energy advocates Fred Garbo of Norway and Shawn Kane of Otisfield recently went into business together, launching Garbo-Kane Integrated Solar Builders to help residents of Oxford Hills and beyond harness the power of the sun.
\
Both men utilize a solar tracker to power their respective homes and the electric car that both of them drive -- the Nissan Leaf.
\
A solar tracker is exactly what is sounds like -- an array of solar panels that follows the sun to garner as much energy as possible throughout the day. The panels are mounted on a mast that moves 6 inches every eight minutes, Garbo said. And it only uses 1 percent of the energy it produces to turn itself, Kane added.
\
""We're trying to walk the walk and talk the talk,"" Garbo said. ""I've been doing it for three years and I've been saving money and helping the environment.""
\
The pair attended solar tracker school in Vermont in May for a couple of days, learning how the machinery works and how to put it together, in addition to becoming factory-certified installation technicians.
\
""It's tried and true, Garbo said. ""There's over 3,000 trackers up in Vermont where they're made since 2006.""
\
He talked about net metering, where the solar tracker sends electricity to the grid if it's not being utilized, which gives the user a credit bank to cash in during the winter months or days when the sun isn't shining.
\
""Every sunny day, there's a wonderful feeling that you're making something,"" Garbo said. ""It's a local, sustainable resource. (And clients) won't have to shovel off the panels in the winter because the tracker sheds snow.""
\
Other benefits of the solar tracker include not having to install panels and cut holes in the roof, and this moving tracking system garners more energy. The pair estimated the solar tracker produces 30 to 40 percent more energy than roof- or ground-mounted arrays.
\
Their quest for solar and renewable energy began four winters ago when Garbo and Kane first met at a timber frame-raising party at Roberts Farm Preserve in Norway. Kane was living in an off-the-grid camp in Otisfield at the time, when he met Scott and Zizi Vlaun. This is how Center for an Ecology-Based Economy in Norway was founded and Garbo later joined as advisory board member.
\
""We've been friends ever since. . . . It seemed like a natural progression of sustainability,"" Kane said about their solar business. ""When we saw Revision Energy trucks going by and doing installations around here, we were like, 'Wow, that would be fun to do. But do we want to drive to Portland to hop in their trucks and drive all over the state? Or do we want to make some sort of impact here locally?' That's when we decided to start our own.""
\
Their first clients were Mike and Stacey Tibbetts, who had them install a solar tracker on their farm in West Paris. It took them three days to build the solar tracker this summer. If the couple had a roof array, it would have needed 36 panels for 9 kilowatts of power. But instead, the solar tracker only used 24 panels for the same amount of power.
\
They will save roughly $1,800 a year in energy costs they don't have to pay to Central Maine Power, and it will take between six and seven years to pay for the tracker, Kane said.
\
Using estimates from Revision Energy -- the company that installed Garbo's solar tracker on the land of his neighbor, Rick Morse -- a 3-kilowatt array, which will only offset some of a household's energy consumption, costs around $11,000, whereas 4 to 5 kilowatts for an average-size home ranges between $15,000 and $20,000.
\
Their solar trackers range between $29,000 and $35,000, but there is a federal tax credit available through the end of 2016 that will pay for 30 percent of the project. Garbo said his tracker cost about $30,000 total, but he's only paying $21,000 out of pocket and can roll over his tax credit from year to year.
\
Garbo and Kane didn't want people to balk at the price tag and said it's a balancing act since they know the ins and outs of the solar industry. They talked about grid parity, which means the solar and renewable energy produces the same amount of power as traditionally produced electricity for an equal or lesser cost.
\
""The cost of installing solar is equal or less than grid power,"" Kane said, noting solar tracker owners will save three times as much money over the guaranteed 25-year life span compared to their traditional energy-using counterparts. The panels will work for 35 to 50 years, but they produce less energy as they age. He added industry experts estimate electricity rates will continue to climb between 3 and 3.5 percent each year.
\
""It's really an investment in solar as an appliance and you're going to reap the benefits over 25 years,"" Garbo said. ""What other thing can you buy nowadays that can do that?""
\
The team is looking for businesses that want to sign on to the solar revolution, which can be written off as an expense. The duo is in search of a host for a community solar farm, because not all of their clients have ideal spaces for solar power. They're also eyeing retrofitting golf carts to turn them into solar-powered generators, as Garbo and Kane have done for Garbo's other electric vehicle, which he hasn't plugged in for two years.
\
""It's another aspect of integrating solar into our daily lives,"" Kane said.

354,"Rosanne Graef knew the costs would be steep when she, along with eight other families, invested in a set of solar panels that would stand on her old family property in Wayne. But the investment would cut Graef's fossil fuel usage, which seemed like a worthy reason to proceed. \When the array went online in 2016, it was one of the first community solar farms in Maine. The farms' members live in different parts of the state and receive a corresponding credit on their power bills for every kilowatt generated at the Wayne site. \But like dozens of Mainers who have helped grow the state's solar industry in recent years, Graef and her fellow farmers now face an unexpected challenge to the viability of their project: higher local taxes. \After the array was built, the town assessed its value to be $137,300 - $87,300 more than what Graef and the other owners think its value should be. The resulting taxes, they say, could cut into their already slim savings and double the number of years they thought they'd need to recoup their costs. \After Wayne officials denied the farm's request for a tax abatement, its members appealed the decision to Kennebec County commissioners. Their case will be heard at a March 6 meeting. \Wayne isn't the only Maine community in which a growing market for clean energy has bumped against the standard ways of collecting taxes. \In South China, members of another community solar farm also think they were over-assessed and are considering requesting an abatement. In York, a groups of residents who installed solar panels on their roofs have applied for abatements, but the town recently denied those requests. In Brunswick, the owners of various solar projects have been discussing their tax assessments with the town. \As those challenges mount, advocates for the solar industry warn that the traditional ways communities tax property could scare Mainers from making further investments in clean technology. \SOLAR FARMS HAVE LARGE UPFRONT COSTS \Those investments contribute to society by reducing the amount of carbon that's burnt, they argue, but require significant upfront and ongoing costs, such as for insurance, rent and maintenance. They also say that Maine should follow at least 20 other states, including several in New England, that have exempted residential renewable energy equipment from property taxes. \""Truly, there should be an exemption like there is in other states,"" said Kristin Collins, an attorney for the owners of the Wayne project, which is called Sky Ranch Community Solar Farm. ""The margins are so slim, so if you bump up taxes just a little bit, it might tip the scales. A small amount of tax increase may go a long way in discouraging this type of investment."" \About 25 states, along with Washington, D.C., have laws that exempt renewable energy equipment from property taxes, according to a database run by the N.C. Clean Energy Center Technology Center, at the College of Engineering at N.C. State University in North Carolina. \Another three, including New Hampshire, have passed laws giving local governments the option to pass exemptions. \Maine is alone among New England states in not having such a law on the books, and some industry watchers say it's falling behind as a result of that and other factors. \The number of new residential solar installations in Maine roughly tripled between 2012 and 2016, but the state is ranked 39th in overall solar development, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Less than one percent of the state's electricity comes from the sun. \Another challenge to the state's solar industry was the decision by the state's Public Utility Commission to gradually phase out a financial incentive, known as net metering, that allowed solar panel owners to receive a credit on their electric bill equal to the value of any excess energy they generate. \Opponents of net metering, including Gov. Paul LePage and Central Maine Power Co., have argued that it increases costs for other electric customers, and a bill that would have temporarily preserved the incentive was vetoed last summer. \Towns, meanwhile, say they're simply following the rules for determining property value, but also acknowledge the unique quality of the cases before them. \""This is new territory for assessing,"" said Aaron Chrostowsky, Wayne's town manager. ""This has the opportunity to be a landmark case for municipalities in Maine."" \'NOBODY WAS PREPARED FOR THESE TAXES' \In Wayne, Sky Ranch Community Solar Farm takes up less than 1 acre of a 90-acre property on Morrison Heights Road, which overlooks Androscoggin Lake. The land belongs to Graef. Her father, a commercial pilot, enjoyed flying small planes from a grass airstrip there that also was called ""Sky Ranch."" \After hearing a presentation from the Sierra Club, Graef decided to lease the land to a group of people, including herself, who would install a 49.6-kilowatt solar array and use its power to offset their bills from Central Maine Power. The company that built the array, ReVision Energy, has encouraged that approach for people who may want to invest in solar, but can't install panels on their homes. About 10 other farms exist around the state, according to one company official. \Graef, who lives in Portland, mainly wanted to help the environment and recognized that any savings from the project would be a long time coming. Still, when her first tax bill arrived, it struck her as too high. \She applied for a tax abatement, along with the eight other families who belong to the solar farm. They have mailing addresses in Portland, South Portland, Freeport, Orr's Island, Mount Vernon and Camden, according to documents provided by the town. \""Nobody was prepared for these taxes,"" Graef said. ""Most of us knew people who had solar panels on homes and they weren't assessed (in a similar way). ... I know there's a perception being bandied about that solar power is for people with money, but the people that can afford that investment are making it on behalf of everyone."" \Graef and the other members paid their taxes at the assessed rate, she added, as they didn't want a lien placed on the property. \But the town denied their abatement requests. \Matthew Caldwell of the Pittsfield firm RJD Appraisal wrote letters last August to the individual members of the farm. They had failed to demonstrate his assessment was ""manifestly wrong,"" a legal standard established in a 1999 case, City of Biddeford v. Adams, according to Caldwell. He also indicated that Wayne has no policy excluding solar panels from tax valuations. \""In closing, you have not supplied sufficient evidence to demonstrate that your assessment is illegal, unjust or excessive,"" Caldwell wrote.  \In an email, Caldwell declined to speak with the Kennebec Journal and referred questions to the town's attorney, citing the ongoing appeal process. \RESIDENTS CHALLENGE ASSESSMENT \Attorneys representing the solar farm, though, say he missed the mark. \Collins, in a letter appealing the denial to the Kennebec County commissioners, said the assessor should have used a different method to determine the solar farm's value. \She estimated the fair market value of the Wayne property to be $50,000 - roughly a third of the town's assessment. In an interview, she said that she engaged a private appraiser to determine that amount. \Rather than valuing the solar farm on the basis of its replacement cost, Collins said, the assessor should have considered it an ""investment property"" whose value is more dependent on income and costs. \Another attorney who has approached the town of Wayne about the assessment of Sky Ranch Community Solar Farm is Steve Hinchman, chief counsel and director of development for the company that built the array, ReVision Energy, \While it's hard to forecast how productive a solar array will be, Hinchman estimated that it could take 30 years for the members of the Wayne farm to see a return on their investment at the current tax rate. \Between the credits the owners receive on their electricity and costs such as license and meter fees, he estimated the farm would have net energy savings of about $4,600 per year. In a 2016 letter to Caldwell, he suggested ""the proposed property tax would take almost half of that."" \""The members of the solar farm were really left with no choice but to appeal it as unfair and unreasonable,"" Hinchman said during an interview last week. ""I've never really heard of a property tax taking 40 percent of the annual net revenue of equipment in taxes alone. It's punitive."" \MAINE LACKS PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION \It's not clear what decision the Kennebec County commissioners will make in the solar farm appeal. The three commissioners have not stated their opinions, as no hearing has been held, County Administrator Robert Devlin said. \But given the current and potential challenges to the assessments of other solar projects around Maine, advocates for the industry say that Maine should consider creating a property tax exemption for panels and other equipment, so that the industry will have a better chance of growing here. \Another person who is following the outcome of the Wayne farm's appeal process is Robert Flory, the president of a community solar farm in South China. The owners of that array are also thinking about requesting an abatement on their taxes, Flory said. \In Brunswick, Assessor Cathleen Jamison said that owners of solar properties have been meeting with her to discuss their taxes, but haven't filed a formal abatement request. \In York, about a dozen residents with solar panels on their roofs recently had their abatement requests denied. \""Some towns do tax them and some don't,"" said York's assessor, Rick Mace, who compared the recent round of abatement requests to the ""uproar"" when towns first started taxing lobster traps. \If residents are concerned about the taxes on their solar panels, Mace urged them to contact their lawmakers and seek legislation providing more direction to towns. He didn't take a position on the merits of an exemption, but said the state currently has no law that allows towns to exempt solar equipment from property value. \""Let's get statutes on the books, if that's the intent,"" he said. ""But until that happens, there's nothing I can do."" \Steve Kahl, an associate professor of science at Thomas College who has developed renewable energy projects, said that Maine's lack of a tax exemption for residential solar projects is part of a larger neglect by the state's leaders of a promising industry. \Local officials should make sure they aren't taxing solar projects in a manner that would dissuade residents from pursuing them, he said, and state officials should consider creating more incentives for the industry. \""With the rest of the states to the south moving much faster to renewable energy, it just makes sense to move in this direction,"" he said.

355,"Tux Turkel's assessment (April 27) that ""political values and ideology will again play a large role in the future of solar energy growth in Maine"" is disheartening. I hope he's wrong. \Partisan posturing is hurting Maine people who are desperate for good jobs and for more choices in heating their homes. So while Massachusetts trails only California in the number of solar jobs created, and Vermont has three times as many as Maine, we're 40th in the nation in solar jobs. \The over 250,000 solar industry workers in the country help drive the economy in their communities through the taxes they pay and the goods and services they purchase. Vendors supporting the industry create jobs as well. \Rep.

It will establish net metering into law, so solar users can continue to receive credit for the power they produce. \The new Public Utilities Commission rules issued this winter will undermine existing solar industry jobs in Maine, yet Maine taxpayers have shelled out millions of dollars to prop up the highly polluting biomass industry in our state, all in the name of job preservation. \Charlie Baker, the Republican governor of Massachusetts, recently told CNBC that ""solar is an important part of our ever-expanding clean-energy economy in Massachusetts, supporting thousands of high-skilled careers across the commonwealth."" \And in one instance, Vermont's Green Mountain Power was able to avoid spot power purchases at peak prices during a time of peak demand and use stored power from solar, thus saving $200,000, the Associated Press reported in an article published in the Dec. 25 Portland Press Herald. \Maine is missing the boat. \Mary Ann Larson Portland \We in Maine treasure our environment: our clean air, our pure water and our natural wonders, from our spectacular ocean and lake views to our challenging mountains. \Why, then, are we allowing a lame-duck governor to keep the cleanest power possible, solar energy, from happening here in Maine? \There are no fewer than four solar bills coming forward in the Legislature, all deserving serious consideration. \One, L.D. 1373, would keep the governor's appointed Public Utilities Commission from enacting its new rules, which basically shut down all the incentives for installing solar panels on homes. In doing so, the PUC stops good-paying jobs for young people, as well as a cleaner environment through less need for fossil fuel power plants at peak times. \In New England, Maine is dead last, per capita, in solar jobs because of these draconian rules. The argument that solar costs poor people more has been debunked by several studies; in fact, we aren't even paying solar providers a fair rate for the excess power they generate. \It's time to push our legislators to pass one or more of these bills, particularly L.D. 1373, and get us out of the governor's ""Dark Ages"" of sending $5 billion per year out of state to pay for fossil fuels. \Even a coal mining museum in Kentucky has gone solar to save money and clean up air pollution. Why aren't we? \Bob Lyman Freeport \Excessive 'awareness days' drown out important ones \Any modern-day social media user sees ""World XYZ Day"" and ""National XYZ Month"" celebrated online constantly. These obscure holidays may be amusing to participate in, but they are weakening the importance of national health awareness months. \Other than Star Wars Day on May the 4th (be with you), the names and dates of these holidays seem arbitrary. Whether it is appreciating your sibling, pet, left-handed friend or lemonade, it is flaunted online. There is nothing wrong with appreciating everyday luxuries, like your dog or drinking lemonade, but what about the national holidays that existed long before National Pig Day (March 1) and No Socks Day (May 8)? \What about awareness months that matter, and, if spread, could create pivotal change in disease research and drug development? Arbitrary holidays like Hug Your Cat Day (June 4) are being classified as ""national"" or ""official,"" and that is weakening the importance and criticality of awareness months that support health causes - like cystic fibrosis. \Cystic fibrosis is a progressive genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and extensive lung damage - a lifelong challenge most people cannot even imagine. Over 30,000 people are living with cystic fibrosis in the U.S., including myself, and 1,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Raising awareness is urgently important! \May is National Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month, along with Pet Month, Self Discovery Month, Social Media Month and 29 others, according to lists online. Will cystic fibrosis awareness break through the clutter of pet posts? Maybe, maybe not. \Each spring I work hard to raise money for and spread awareness of cystic fibrosis, but it is hard to get a message across when the web is constantly flooding with information. \Let's break through the clutter of social media, this May and every month, by supporting and spreading disease awareness. \Hogan Reed Cumberland \Charging bull sculpture not in front of stock exchange \In a letter published May 1, Michael Grunko states that the charging bull sculpture in Lower Manhattan is in front of the New York Stock Exchange. \The sculptor, Arturo Di Modica, had it installed on Broad Street in front of the NYSE on Dec. 15, 1989. He meant it as a symbol of strength in response to the 1987 stock market crash. The NYSE had the police remove it later the same day. On Dec. 21, 1989, in response to public sentiment, the bull was installed in Bowling Green (at Broadway and Whitehall Street), where it remains today. \The only thing you'll find in front of the stock exchange, these days, will be police with assault rifles. Broad Street is heavily guarded. \George Dragoumanos Saco \If national monument gets reversed, LePage powerless \What in the world makes Gov. Le-Page think that if - and that is a big if - the federal government reverses the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument designation that he will have any control over those 87,000-plus acres? \It was not his to begin with. It was not his to determine how it was to be used and by whom. Prior to the designation, the public had access to the acreage only by the good graces of the Quimby family. \If we do lose the national monument designation, and all the good things that could come from that, it should revert to private property, not to Le-Page's control. \Sari Varney Windham"
356,"I am writing regarding the Maine Sunday Telegram front-page article on the Muhammad Ali-Sonny Liston fight of 50 years ago in Lewiston (""The moment that made Ali,"" May 24). \I find the writing too polite. The fight was clearly fixed, and Liston took a dive as soon as he could. As the article notes, even Ali was surprised that Liston went down so easily. From all I have read, it appears that Ali was unaware that the bout was fixed. \In any case, what I am really writing about is Ali himself. According to Wikipedia, Ali ""refused to be inducted into the U.S. military."" He was not a patriot. He would not serve his country at a time when his country needed him. \His issue was that he wanted to continue to box and make millions of dollars, but he feared being drafted and possibly sent to Vietnam. Fleeing to Canada like many cowards would not work for him. \So he lost his title after being convicted of draft-evasion charges, but the Supreme Court eventually overturned his conviction, based on a narrow point of improperly filled-out paperwork by the local draft board. Sad. \And so, in my opinion, Ali was then and remains to this day an unpatriotic coward. You can argue the point, but you cannot change the facts. He was about to be drafted and he suddenly became a conscientious objector. \Ali has been suffering for a long time now the effects of Parkinson's syndrome. Hey, Ali, what goes around comes around! \I urge Ali, his family and his many followers to visit Washington, D.C. Go to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall, which has the 58,000-plus names of those who died while serving their country in Vietnam. \Spend some time looking for the name of the man who took Ali's place in the draft. Reflect on your cowardice. \Harry White Scarborough \Relaxed mining regulations spell doom for environment \A revised mining bill (L.D. 750) will soon come before the Legislature for a vote. Please contact your legislators and ask them to vote against this dangerous bill. This bill was crafted to favor J.D. Irving, Ltd., not to protect Maine's environment. \L.D. 750 as amended allows open-pit mining with tailings ponds for treatment and storage of waste. This is a 100-year-old high-risk technology that is a recipe for disaster in places like Maine where sulfide deposits occur. \There is no mining expertise in Maine. Mining engineering consultants were not contacted for advice on new technologies for mining in this environment. Modern mines using old technology are still causing major environmental disasters. \This happened in Canada last year when a tailings dam failed and toxic waste was released into pristine waters. We can't let that happen in Maine. \Mining companies worldwide are embracing ""best available technology"" and moving away from open-pit mining and tailings ponds. We must prohibit open-pit mining and tailings ponds in Maine. \Unfortunately, the public does not trust the Department of Environmental Protection under this administration to protect the environment. Maine's clean water and other natural resources must be protected for future generations. \Dave Wood Hallowell \Koch brothers seem beyond repentance of their eco-sins \As a tree-hugging, silver-sneakered, lover of planet Earth, I asked a Unitarian Universalist minister who serves on the same advocacy network as I if a UU may, in good conscience, wish for the justice of having a super storm blow all the Koch brothers' mansions into the acidifying ocean. \Her answer was calm and well-reasoned: It would be more in keeping with UU principles to hope that the brothers reach an enlightened understanding of what their unbridled quest for fossil fuels is doing to the planet and act accordingly. \I humbly had to agree, but wondered which outcome was more likely to happen. \Melanie Lanctot \Readfield \Concealed-carry proposal loaded with dangers \We are responding to the recent letter (May 25) claiming that the ""freedom to carry guns results in lower crime rates."" \The writer mentions six states that have laws similar to the legislation being proposed for Maine that would eliminate the need to get a concealed-weapons permit. \While saying that others manipulate facts and he will now tell us the real story, the writer then proceeds to not give any actual data. \Here is some data we found with a quick search of the FBI website. In 2013, one of the states mentioned in the letter (Alaska) had the second highest violent crime rate (640 per 100,000 residents) in the country. Maine had the second lowest (129 violent crimes per 100,000 residents). \Our very low violent crime rate compared to states that allow concealed handguns without registration tells us that we are already following the correct path. This legislation is unnecessary. \Mike and Maggie Dumais Topsham \Bistro 233 deserves better than Schwartz's bad review \Re: ""Dine Out Maine: Bistro 233 in Yarmouth"" (May 3): \Bistro 233 must now be out of business, employees must now be out of work and James Schwartz must now be basking in his own self-created limelight! \The scathing review of Bistro 233 should never have been printed, and such a determination should have been made by Mr. Schwartz's editor in keeping with the policy printed at the end of this section of the newspaper. \The mission of Dine Out Maine should be strictly about recommending places where the evaluator in his or her opinion believes others may enjoy dining - period. \The mission should never be about red flagging places where he or she believes others may be disappointed. And ""may"" is the important word here. Different persons have different tastes. My case rests! \Mary George Standish \Solar power offering Maine a bright and sunny future \Solar power makes sense for Maine. Solar panels may cost a bundle to install, but the energy is free. Installation costs can be paid off in loan payments to a bank instead of 15 years of electricity bills. Then it's all free - no more bills. If your house is shaded, you can join in as a participant in a solar farm project. \Strange as it may seem, a solar installation in Portland gains as much solar electrical power as one in Houston. Furthermore, the cost of solar panels has dropped 50 percent in five years, and there is a 30 percent federal tax credit on installations until the end of 2016. \Added to that, a recent Public Utilities Commission study analyzed the benefits of solar installations on private homes and businesses. It concluded that there was value to all Central Maine Power customers, even those without installed panels. It gave a price of 38 cents per kilowatt-hour as a reasonable reimbursement to generators for power produced. That's a lot more than the current rate of 14 cents with ""net metering."" \So what are we waiting for? \Despite the advantages listed above, the situation for solar in Maine is poor. We are 10th out of the 10 Northeastern states in solar installations, primarily because there is no state tax credit, and we currently limit the number of participants in a solar farm to only 10. \The current Legislature is considering making changes to benefit solar. Please contact your state senator and representative to encourage them. We will all win. \Peter Garrett Winslow"
357,"WANT A GREENER HOME? HERE'S HOW SEAL YOUR WINDOWS. Save energy by mending cracks and gaps. If you're replacing your windows, get double-paned units. BUY BETTER LIGHTBULBS. Compact fluorescents use a third to a quarter of the electricity of standard incandescent bulbs, and last up to 10 times longer. SUPPORT LOCAL SUPPLIERS. Purchasing materials from regional sources rather than trucking them in from afar saves energy and decreases pollution. LET THE SUNSHINE IN. The proper placement of windows and skylights helps make a small, efficient house seem more open and uplifting. INSULATE. Installing insulation reduces energy usage by curtailing drafts in winter and keeping things cooler in summer. PLANT A TREE. Trees around your house will provide shade in summer, when the branches are full of leaves, yet allow more sun and warmth into your house during the winter, when the branches are bare. AVOID VOCS. Switch to solvent-free adhesives and water-based interior paints and sealers that are low in ""volatile organic compounds."" These are the chemicals you're inhaling in any room that has that ""new paint"" smell. BUNDLE UP. Lower your thermostat a few degrees in winter and wear a cozy sweater around the house. If you have a conventional water heater, have it insulated free of charge by your utility company. EMBRACE THE REPLACEABLE. Choose rapidly renewing materials, such as cork, bamboo, soy, wheat, hemp, cotton and sisal or use reclaimed hardwoods. Source: Natural Health BE GREEN MORE CONSERVATION TIPS for house and yard: ecycle everything you can. Try to use phosphate-free laundry and dish soaps. Use cold water in the washer whenever possible. Don't use electrical appliances for things you can easily do by hand, such as opening cans. Re-use brown paper bags to line your trash can instead of plastic liners. Store food in re-usable containers instead of using plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Take unwanted, re-usable items to a charitable organization or thrift shop. Install a water-saving shower head. Set your water heater at 130 degrees. Turn off the lights, TV or other electrical appliances when you leave a room. Get a free energy audit from your utility company. Pull weeds instead of using herbicides. Use only organic fertilizers. Compost leaves and yard debris, or take them to a yard debris recycler. Burning them creates air pollution and putting them out with the trash uses up landfill space. Use mulch to conserve water in your garden.

Equipped with a solar power system, the house surrounded by 28 acres of woods off Old Brunswick Road is completely independent of the utility grid. Solar panels on the metal roof connect to batteries in the basement that store up to a week's worth of electricity when the sun is not shining.\ To live comfortably off the sun's rays, the Yeos have tightly sealed their home to conserve energy, with a state-of-the-art ventilation system designed to bring in fresh air from the outside. By contrast, older homes are often drafty and susceptible to changes in temperature as the weather changes, causing homeowners to turn on their air conditioning and heating systems more often.\ The Yeos say their home is ""as green as it gets,"" with features such as an energy-efficient water pump and boiler, solar heating integrated into a radiant floor system, compact fluorescent bulb lighting, double-paned windows, foamed-in-place insulation, energy- efficient appliances, low vapor-emitting paint and salvaged building materials.\ ""Seeing overconsumption, waste and pollution has driven us to the extreme,"" said Bill, 38, who is a clerk in L.L. Bean's bike-and-ski department and travels the world, hiking and teaching mountain climbing. ""Americans buy cheap, and don't look at the long term. When we go to our recycling area, we see people unloading trucks of cheap stuff that doesn't look that old. You don't see that kind of waste in other countries.""\ Sustainable design or building ""green"" is the practice of employing natural resources efficiently while creating healthier buildings.\ According to the National Association of Home Builders, a total of 18,987 eco-friendly homes were built between 1990 and 2001. In 2002 alone, the number of green homes built totaled 13,224.\ ""Green building, from our perspective, seems to be getting a lot more popular in Maine,"" said Charlie Langston, chief financial officer and chief operating officer at Solar Market alternative energy store in Arundel. ""It used to be just a few people living out in the woods, but it's now much more mainstream. We find lots of people are interested just for the principle.""\ Langston says in the Northeast, homeowners who go completely solar like the Yeos are rare, since heat and hot water are needed year-round.\ When solar energy doesn't provide enough warmth in the winter months, the Yeos will light a fire in the wood stove in their living room.\ Most people who purchase a solar system choose a utility- connected one, which supplements what is available to the home from the electric company. When the solar cells do not provide enough electricity for the building's users, extra electricity is supplied by the utility line and the building's electric meter records the amount used. And at times when the solar cells provide more than enough energy for the home, the additional power is fed back into the utility grid and the building's electric meter runs backward, recording the ""sale"" of the electricity to the utility. This arrangement, called net metering, is available in Maine and most states in the Northeast.\ At Solar Market, grid-tied solar systems start at $4,000, which will provide 2,880 watts, or 10 percent of the energy needed to run a small home, said Langston.\ ""You'll see a small impact in your utility bill,"" said Langston. ""And you're hedging against future electricity prices. If prices increase there may be a faster payback.""\ Solar panels are now more efficient and the price has dropped from $100 per watt in the 1970s to about $3 per watt today. For about $20,000, you can purchase a solar system that provides half of the energy needed to run a home. Solar systems are also more reliable, and carry 20- to 30-year warranties.\ While electricity produced from solar cells is still initially more expensive than it is from fossil fuels such as coal and oil, analysts predict that the solar energy industry will continue to see increasing demand as people choose more environmentally friendly lifestyles.\ ""Global warming is really happening and we need to do something about it,"" said Langston. ""Most of our customers are frustrated with the lack of activity at the governmental level, and want to take things into their own hands.""\ OFF THE UTILITY GRID\ The Yeos are adamant about living off the utility grid because they believe that hydroelectric dams upset aquaculture and fossil fuel use puts harmful particulates, such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, into the air.\ ""People don't think where energy comes from when they flip on the light switch,"" said Bill Yeo. ""The resources used are polluting our environment or damaging it in some way. . . . Even the air quality in Maine is really bad.""\ Bill Yeo bought his wooded parcel here over a decade ago after growing tired of paying rent. He pitched a tent in the land and later built a tiny solar-powered cabin on the property.\ After he and Julie were married, the couple lived in the cabin and began sketching plans for their new home in 2001. They decided early on that they wanted a post-and-beam house assembled with wooden pegs instead of nails.\ ""People were skeptical when we first started,"" said Bill Yeo.\ A friend with access to computer-aided design technology helped the Yeos turn their sketches into blueprints. In December 2002, the couple and their friends cut and milled trees grown on the property and raised the frame of the 28-foot-by-36-foot house.\ Bill Yeo estimates that at least 13 large white pines were used for the beams, and some hemlock and spruce were cut for flooring and other supports.\ ""I used to be so green I never wanted to cut any trees,"" said Yeo. ""But I have learned that cutting the older trees will open up the sunlight for the younger trees.""\ Before installing the roof, the Yeos left the frame to dry and season over the winter, withstanding heavy rain and freezing weather.\ In the spring, they began erecting superinsulated walls with foam- core panels, working as their own general contractors around their full-time jobs to save money on their construction loan and ensure that the quality of the house met their approval. They researched every aspect of building their green home, from constructing the 8- foot foundation to the four dormer windows, seeking expert advice whenever possible.\ The only major work they hired a subcontractor for was the installation of the metal roof, which they later regretted.\ ""They said they could do it in a day, but they were here for three months,"" recalled Bill Yeo. ""They did a decent job, but we had to patch up their mistakes.""\ RADIANT TUBING\ To heat the home, Bill Yeo installed 2,500 feet of radiant tubing in the basement, first and second floors. Water in the tubes is heated by their highly efficient, solar-powered boiler. The boiler turns on only when hot water is needed, instead of running constantly like a conventional 40- to 80-gallon tank, which uses more propane than the Yeos' unit.\ Their water pump is also extra efficient, with an adjustable voltage feature that fluctuates depending on how much water the household is using from their 240-foot-deep well.\ Bill Yeo also installed the home's solar power system, which runs off of 10 panels on the roof that are wired to an inverter, which converts direct current electricity to alternating current electricity for standard household appliances.\ The Yeos say people can live comfortably off a solar power system as long as they choose energy-efficient appliances.\ ""We can run our washer and dryer and use power tools, . . . but the appliances have to be energy efficient, like Energy Star,"" said Julie Yeo, referring to the label given to products that meet strict energy efficiency guidelines set by the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Energy.\ The Yeos' lighting is provided by compact fluorescent bulbs, which are more expensive than incandescent bulbs but use a quarter of the energy and last about 10 years. Their custom-built refrigerator was shipped from Sun Frost in California, a brand that claims it has the most energy-efficient refrigerators and freezers on the market. They also have low-flush toilets.\ The Yeos also searched for reusable building materials, finding old doors at Portland Architectural Salvage, surplus Mexican tiles from the Maine Housing and Building Materials Exchange in Gray, scrap wood purchased from an Uncle Henry's ad and free wood available in a Brunswick lumber yard's burn pile. As well, a mason friend built their chimney from salvaged brick.\ And when new building materials were needed, they sought products that were as local as possible. Slate pieces for the living room and kitchen floor were purchased in Monson, cedar shingles were bought from a family-run sawmill in northern Maine, and at Hancock Windows in Portland, they bought their double-insulated, argon-filled low-E windows.\ RE-USED WINE CORKS\ For nontoxic paint and sealer, they drove to a store in Massachusetts. Some items, such as the refrigerator, were purchased online and shipped. The Yeos are also considering having cork flooring for their second floor shipped from overseas. Cork flooring is made from recycled wine corks, which are made from bark harvested from the cork oak tree of Spain and Portugal. The bark can be harvested every nine years without harm to the tree.\ The Yeos hope to move into their new house by the end of the summer, and will continue to use their cabin as an art studio. They estimate that the house is worth two to three times the amount they spent to build it, and they have the satisfaction of knowing how each part of the house was constructed.\ ""We're not timber-framers, we're not builders, but we pulled it off,"" said Julie Yeo. ""And we've had fun, building camaraderie with our friends who helped us.""\ Bill Yeo said he is now considering becoming a certified solar panel installer and starting a green building consulting service, using his home as a showroom. He said he never once doubted that he and his wife could build their home the way they wanted.\ ""I climb a lot of mountains,"" said Bill Yeo. ""It comes down to having the confidence and courage to tackle it yourself.""\ Staff Writer Selena Ricks can be contacted at 791-6451 or at:\ sricks@pressherald.com"
358,"After a wave of solar development across Maine in the last couple years, rooftop solar panels and community solar farms are starting to come due for their first rounds of property taxes. That has raised questions about how Maine communities should tax solar property, and posed a challenge for those trying to grow the state's solar industry. The owners of a community solar farm in Wayne say it was it overvalued by the town and, in what one official called an ""unprecedented"" effort, have appealed their request for a tax abatement to the county. Other solar property owners in towns such as York and South China are considering or have mounted similar requests.\Rosanne Graef knew the costs would be steep when she, along with eight other families, invested in a set of solar panels that would stand on her old family property in Wayne. But the investment would cut Graefï¿½s fossil fuel usage, which seemed like a worthy reason to proceed. \When the array went online in 2016, it was one of the first community solar farms in Maine. Rather than producing electricity at their homes, the farmsï¿½ members live in different parts of the state and receive a corresponding credit on their power bills for every kilowatt generated at the Wayne site. \But like dozens of Mainers who helped grow the stateï¿½s solar industry in recent years, Graef and her fellow farmers now face an unexpected challenge to the viability of their project: higher local taxes. \After the array was built, the town assessed its value to be $137,300 ï¿½ $87,300 more than what Graef and the other owners think its value should be. The resulting taxes, they say, could cut into their already slim savings and double the number of years they thought theyï¿½d need to recoup their costs. \After Wayne officials denied the farmï¿½s request for a tax abatement, its members appealed the decision to the Kennebec County commissioners. Their case will be heard at a March 6 meeting. \Wayne isnï¿½t the only Maine community in which a growing market for clean energy has bumped against the standard ways of collecting taxes.\In South China, members of another community solar farm also think they were over-assessed and are considering requesting an abatement. In York, a groups of residents who installed solar panels on their roofs have applied for abatements, but the town recently denied those requests. In Brunswick, the owners of various solar projects have been discussing their tax assessments with the town. \As those challenges mount, advocates for the solar industry warn that the traditional ways communities tax property could scare Mainers from making further investments in clean technology. \Those investments contribute to society by reducing the amount of carbon thatï¿½s burnt, they argue, but require significant upfront and ongoing costs, such as for insurance, rent and maintenance. They also say that Maine should follow at least 20 other states, including several in New England, that have exempted residential renewable energy equipment from property taxes. \ï¿½Truly, there should be an exemption like there is in other states,ï¿½ said Kristin Collins, an attorney for the owners of the Wayne project, which is called Sky Ranch Community Solar Farm. ï¿½The margins are so slim, so if you bump up taxes just a little bit, it might tip the scales. A small amount of tax increase may go a long way in discouraging this type of investment.ï¿½\About 25 states, along with Washington, D.C., have laws that exempt renewable energy equipment from property taxes, according to a database run by the N.C. Clean Energy Center Technology Center, at the College of Engineering at N.C. State University in North Carolina. Another three, including New Hampshire, have passed laws giving local governments the option to pass exemptions. \Maine is alone among New England states in not having such a law on the books, and some industry watchers say itï¿½s falling behind as a result of that and other factors. \The number of new residential solar installations in Maine roughly tripled between 2012 and 2016, but the state is ranked 39th in overall solar development, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Less than one percent of the stateï¿½s electricity comes from the sun.\Another challenge to the stateï¿½s solar industry was the decision by the stateï¿½s Public Utility Commission to gradually phase out a financial incentive, known as net metering, that allowed solar panel owners to receive a credit on their electric bill equal to the value of any excess energy they generate. \Opponents of net metering, including Gov. Paul LePage and Central Maine Power, have argued that it increases costs for other electric customers, and a bill that would have temporarily preserved the incentive was vetoed last summer. \Towns, meanwhile, say theyï¿½re simply following the rules for determining property value, but also acknowledge the unique quality of the cases before them. \ï¿½This is new territory for assessing,ï¿½ said Aaron Chrostowsky, Wayneï¿½s town manager. ï¿½This has the opportunity to be a landmark case for municipalities in Maine.ï¿½\In Wayne, Sky Ranch Community Solar Farm takes up less than 1 acre of a 90-acre property on Morrison Heights Road, which overlooks Androscoggin Lake. The land belongs to Graef. Her father, a commercial pilot, enjoyed flying small planes from a grass airstrip there that also was called ï¿½Sky Ranch.ï¿½ \After hearing a presentation from the Sierra Club, Graef decided to lease the land to a group of people, including herself, who would install a 49.6-kilowatt solar array and use its power to offset their bills from Central Maine Power Co. The company that built the array, ReVision Energy, has encouraged that approach for people who may want to invest in solar, but canï¿½t install panels on their homes. About 10 other farms exist around the state, according to one company official. \Graef, who lives in Portland, mainly wanted to help the environment and recognized that any savings from the project would be a long time coming. Still, when her first tax bill arrived, it struck her as too high. \She applied for a tax abatement, along with the eight other families who belong to the solar farm. They have mailing addresses in Portland, South Portland, Freeport, Orrï¿½s Island, Mount Vernon and Camden, according to documents provided by the town. \ï¿½Nobody was prepared for these taxes,ï¿½ Graef said. ï¿½Most of us knew people who had solar panels on homes and they werenï¿½t assessed (in a similar way). ... I know thereï¿½s a perception being bandied about that solar power is for people with money, but the people that can afford that investment are making it on behalf of everyone.ï¿½\Graef and the other members paid their taxes at the assessed rate, she added, as they didnï¿½t want a lien placed on the property. \But the town denied their abatement requests. \Matthew Caldwell of the Pittsfield firm RJD Appraisal wrote letters last August to the individual members of the farm. They had failed to demonstrate his assessment was ï¿½manifestly wrong,ï¿½ a legal standard established in a 1999 case, City of Biddeford v. Adams, according to Caldwell. He also indicated that Wayne has no policy excluding solar panels from tax valuations. \ï¿½In closing, you have not supplied sufficient evidence to demonstrate that your assessment is illegal, unjust or excessive,ï¿½ Caldwell wrote. \In an email, Caldwell declined to speak with the Kennebec Journal and referred questions to the townï¿½s attorney, citing the ongoing appeal process. \Attorneys representing the solar farm, though, say he missed the mark. \Collins, in a letter appealing the denial to the Kennebec County commissioners, said the assessor should have used a different method to determine the solar farmï¿½s value. She estimated the fair market value of the Wayne property to be $50,000 ï¿½ roughly a third of the townï¿½s assessment. In an interview, she said that she engaged a private appraiser to determine that amount. \Rather than valuing the solar farm on the basis of its replacement cost, Collins said, the assessor should have considered it an ï¿½investment propertyï¿½ whose value is more dependent on income and costs. \Another attorney who has approached the town of Wayne about the assessment of Sky Ranch Community Solar Farm is Steve Hinchman, chief counsel and director of development for the company that built the array, ReVision Energy,\While itï¿½s hard to forecast how productive a solar array will be, Hinchman estimated that it could take 30 years for the members of the Wayne farm to see a return on their investment at the current tax rate. \Between the credits the owners receive on their electricity and costs such as license and meter fees, he estimated the farm would have net energy savings of about $4,600 per year. In a 2016 letter to Caldwell, he suggested ï¿½the proposed property tax would take almost half of that.ï¿½\ï¿½The members of the solar farm were really left with no choice but to appeal it as unfair and unreasonable,ï¿½ Hinchman said during an interview last week. ï¿½Iï¿½ve never really heard of a property tax taking 40 percent of the annual net revenue of equipment in taxes alone. Itï¿½s punitive.ï¿½\Itï¿½s not clear what decision the Kennebec County commissioners will make in the solar farm appeal. The three commissioners have not stated their opinions, as no hearing has been held, said County Administrator Robert Devlin. \But given the current and potential challenges to the assessments of other solar projects around Maine, advocates for the industry say that Maine should consider creating a property tax exemption for panels and other equipment, so that the industry will have a better chance of growing here. \Another person who is following the outcome of the Wayne farmï¿½s appeal process is Robert Flory, the president of a community solar farm in South China. The owners of that array are also thinking about requesting an abatement on their taxes, Flory said. \In Brunswick, Assessor Cathleen Jamison said that owners of solar properties have been meeting with her to discuss their taxes, but havenï¿½t filed a formal abatement request. \In York, about a dozen residents with solar panels on their roofs recently had their abatement requests denied. \ï¿½Some towns do tax them and some donï¿½t,ï¿½ said Yorkï¿½s assessor, Rick Mace, who compared the recent round of abatement requests to the ï¿½uproarï¿½ when towns first started taxing lobster traps.\If residents are concerned about the taxes on their solar panels, Mace urged them to contact their lawmakers and seek legislation providing more direction to towns. He didnï¿½t take a position on the merits of an exemption, but said the state currently has no law that allows towns to exempt solar equipment from property value.\ï¿½Letï¿½s get statutes on the books, if thatï¿½s the intent,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½But until that happens, thereï¿½s nothing I can do.ï¿½\William Healey, president of the Maine Association of Assessing Officers and the assessor for Lewiston, didnï¿½t respond to requests for an interview about the challenges of assessing solar.\Steve Kahl, an associate professor of science at Thomas College who has developed renewable energy projects, said that Maineï¿½s lack of a tax exemption for residential solar projects is part of a larger neglect by the stateï¿½s leaders of a promising industry. \Local officials should make sure they arenï¿½t taxing solar projects in a manner that would dissuade residents from pursuing them, he said, and state officials should consider creating more incentives for the industry.\ï¿½With the rest of the states to the south moving much faster to renewable energy, it just makes sense to move in this direction,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½Weï¿½re fighting an uphill battle.ï¿½ \Credit: By CHARLES EICHACKER Staff Writer"
359,"This package will contain all letters to the editor that are awaiting editing and headlines.\city's solar project\I am very excited about the project to convert a landfill into a solar farm (""Waterville enters partnership to explore solar project at city's capped landfill,"" Aug. 7). This project is a great example of how innovation can turn an unproductive piece of land into something useful again. \According to Environment America's clean energy progress report released this summer, Maine ranks 41st in the nation for solar energy. It's time we turn that around, and this project will hopefully help foster confidence in other solar projects across the state. Solar technology has evolved to be efficient, reliable, and increasingly more affordable.\Although Maine's solar bill, which would have partially restored net metering in the state, failed to survive a veto by Gov. Paul LePage, we are lucky to have other elected representatives that will listen to us and will work to protect our beautiful state. We must continue to encourage Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins to stop the rollback of federal safeguards such as the clean cars bill, the Clean Power Plan, and the Clean Air Act. Let our representatives know you appreciate the protections they have voted to keep in place and encourage them to continue protecting the environment, because our health and our children are worth it.\Credit: "
360,"Maine's government is set to make a dramatic pivot in 2019. Swept to sizable majorities in last week's elections, Democrats will be in full control of state government for the first time since 2010.\They are poised to push for changes that will affect many aspects of Maine life. Tops among them will be an expansion of the state's Medicaid system, MaineCare, making health insurance coverage available to 70,000 low-income people.\But Democrats are likely to look for ways to address climate change, refocus on cleaner air and water, support treatment and prevention of opioid addiction, restore revenue sharing to local communities, and take the pressure off property taxes.\At the helm will be Maine's first female governor - Gov.-elect Janet Mills - as well as the state's Democratic attorney general and a Legislature that is also going to include more female lawmakers than at any time in the state's history.\Mills, herself a former state lawmaker, has said she intends to work in collaboration with legislators from both parties as she and other Democrats pursue their goals. She said members of her Cabinet will be available to the Legislature as well, unlike outgoing Gov. Paul LePage, who frequently restrained members of his Cabinet and their staff from appearing before legislative committees as they crafted and debated new laws.\""I want to be a governor of all the people of Maine,"" Mills said Friday in a phone interview with the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram. She said the tone and the message coming from inside the governor's office is going to change dramatically and in a positive fashion.\""I promise, in my office, you will find an open door, an open mind and an open heart,"" Mills said.\Here are some of the proposals Mainers will likely see:\TAXATION\Property tax relief among governor-elect's goals\LePage worked to reduce the state's income tax, gradually cutting the top rate from 8.5 percent to 7.15 percent. But he fell well short of his goal of eliminating the income tax entirely largely because of resistance from members of his own party over an expansion of the state's sales tax. Mills said she has no intention of undoing LePage's cuts, but she would look toward broadening the sales tax as way of lowering the income tax rate, still one of the highest in the nation.\Mills said she was heartened that the Senate's new Republican leader, Sen. Dana Dow, seems open to the idea as well.\""I don't have a specific plan to change the tax policy right now,"" Mills said. ""I'm not interested in increasing taxes.""\She said she is interested in providing Mainers with greater property tax relief. ""But to do that I need to look at the whole budget,"" Mills said. The budget will be her first major task when she takes the reins from LePage in January.\HEALTH CARE\Leaders want to improve state's vaccination rates\Mills vowed to implement Medicaid expansion ""on day one,"" which would bring health care coverage to 70,000 low-income Mainers, mostly childless adults and working-class parents who don't have insurance through an employer.\Medicaid expansion, health experts say, is key to improving Maine's health care system in a number of ways, such as opening up substance use and mental health treatment to low-income Mainers, and boosting the financial stability of rural hospitals, which have a higher share of low-income patients.\Rep. Patricia Hymanson, D-York and House chairwoman of the Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee, said Mills will be a dramatic change after eight years of the LePage administration, which she said did not prioritize public health.\Other health care issues that could come up include improving vaccination coverage and hiring more public health nurses.\Mills said she is committed to rebuilding the public health network in a more aggressive manner than the LePage administration, which is under pressure from a lawsuit and has begun to hire more nurses.\""Of course some of it depends on workforce availability,"" Mills said, ""but we do need to reinvigorate public health nursing infrastructure, which really has been decimated under the current administration and I'm not sure why. We need to ramp up home visitation services. We are the only state in the nation with a rising infant mortality rate - that's a problem right off the bat that's got to be addressed - and beefing up the public health infrastructure is a part of the way we address that.""\Rep. Ralph Tucker, D-Brunswick, said eliminating or limiting non-medical exemptions for school-required vaccines will be one of his top priorities with Mills in office.\Maine consistently has one of the highest percentages in the nation of kindergartners who enter school without getting their vaccines, in part because Maine makes it easy to opt out.\""I've already submitted a bill,"" Tucker said. ""I think vaccines are very important, and I'm going to push this issue as hard as I can.""\Mills said she agrees with Tucker and others but is not completely familiar with the legislation he is proposing.\""We have a disturbingly low rate of vaccination in some parts of the state and we need to address that, too,"" Mills said. ""Public education, public messaging is very important to make sure people know there is no harm in vaccination, the harm is in not vaccinating.""\ENERGY\ POLICY\In reversal, support for wind and solar is renewed\LePage made lower energy costs a top priority yet also created a schism in the ""green energy"" sector by extolling the benefits of hydropower while railing against the wind and solar sectors.\Mills, by comparison, made renewable energy a central theme of her campaign.\On solar, Mills supports strengthening ""net metering"" policies that provide electricity price credits to homeowners who feed excess power onto the grid from their solar panels. While a controversial Maine Public Utilities Commission rule to phase out net metering is tied up in court, solar supporters and Democratic lawmakers are likely to try again for a legislative fix that LePage repeatedly vetoed.\Mills has also said she supports changing regulations to allow larger-scale solar projects and enable more users to tap into ""community-scale"" solar installations.\Mills also sees opportunities to expand the state's efforts on helping Mainers weatherize their homes, convert to heat pumps or adopt energy-efficient technology without raising ratepayer fees.\Mills vowed to end LePage's declared (but unenforced) ban on permits for new land-based wind energy projects. And she strongly backs a University of Maine project that supporters contend could enable Maine to become a leader in the construction and deployment of floating, offshore wind turbines.\One issue that Mills appears ready to jump into - and says LePage should steer clear of - is Central Maine Power's controversial deal with HydroQuebec to route a 145-mile high-voltage transmission line through western Maine.\LePage was a proponent of the project and, last month, made a stopover in Spain during a trade mission to meet with executives of Iberdrola, CMP's parent company.\Mills has expressed strong concerns about the transmission line's impact on the mountains and river valleys of western Maine - her home region - and said the project needs to benefit Maine ratepayers.\""I think this governor needs to stop talking to HydroQuebec, CMP, Iberdrola and stop taking detours from Iceland to Spain. This is not for him to do,"" Mills said Wednesday. ""I think it's for the next governor ... to make sure that the people of Maine are heard, to make sure that if there is a deal cut, the people of Maine get the best possible deal. And I expect to be at the table.""\CLIMATE\ CHANGE\The Election Day message? 'Voters ... want action.'\After being relegated to almost non-issue status in recent state and national elections, climate change and other environmental concerns were back in the spotlight in the 2018 campaigns.\Mills often ranked climate change and the environment among her top priorities, as she did hours after her victory while discussing the significance of working with a Democratic majority in the Legislature.\Mills has called for setting an ambitious goal of reducing climate-warming pollution by 80 percent by 2030, although she has yet to work out the specifics. The current state goal is to reduce emissions 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.\""It's a big item and it takes a lot of work,"" Mills said Friday. ""And I'll be talking to people in the industry, the advocacy areas to put forward the best package I can.""\As attorney general, Mills also joined other states in challenging the Trump administration's attempts to roll back environmental policies, such as the Clean Power Plan's limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.\""Voters sent a very clear message on climate change in Maine on Election Day, and that's that they want action,"" Maureen Drouin, executive director of Maine Conservation Voters, said Friday. Drouin's organization spent more than $1.4 million on the campaign touting Mills and targeting Moody's inconsistent statements on the issue.\Mills has also called for a significant new infusion of money into Land for Maine's Future, which uses voter-approved bonds to help landowners conserve forestlands, farms and working waterfronts.\She has also pledged to be more proactive in seeking federal Forest Legacy funds to protect working forests from development. Maine had consistently led the nation in applying for and receiving Forest Legacy funding, but the state has opted to skip several application rounds under LePage.\SOCIAL
\ SERVICES\Consult 'forgotten heroes' in decision-making process\After the deaths of two young girls last fall and winter, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services was under the microscope for how it operated the child protection and foster care system.\The Legislature responded by passing a $21 million bill that increased the number of child protective caseworkers, boosted pay and also de-emphasized reunification with families. Current law requires child protection workers to make reuniting children with their family the priority after children are removed from a home.\Claire Berkowitz, executive director of the Maine Children's Alliance, a nonprofit, said she's heartened by Mills' election, and the promise of a new administration that will revamp DHHS. Berkowitz said depending on how the new law is enforced, having fewer family reunifications may not make for a better system.\""We have to be careful not to swing the pendulum too far the other way,"" Berkowitz said.\Said Mills, ""I'll be getting information from the nonprofit sector, from foster parents generally and from the folks at DHHS who are dealing with this in the field, on the ground.""\She also said the child protection attorneys within her current office needed to be consulted with - after being generally shut out of decision making by the LePage administration.\""Child protection, child support, the homicide people, the drug prosecutors - these are incredible people,"" Mills said. ""It's sad how we've been treated by the current administration; they are forgotten heroes in my book. They are a critical resource for me as attorney general, for me as governor-elect, for me as governor.""\BUSINESS &\ REGULATIONS\Encourage growth while improving workers' lives\Mills has said the state cannot, and should not, attempt to solve every economic problem, but that it can play a critical role in providing technical, financial and training assistance to Maine businesses. Her plan is to streamline the state's current ""alphabet soup of economic development agencies"" into a single entity called the Maine Growth Authority that would drive economic growth.\Mills also has said she wants to offer no-interest loans to businesses to finance their growth, create special districts to promote regional broadband internet projects, create tax incentives for in-migration of workers to the state and eliminate disincentives for out-of-state companies to let their employees work remotely in Maine.\""When I campaigned around the state I talked with many, many businesses from the very small to the very large,"" Mills said. ""We talked about their challenges, their workforce needs. We talked about nothing but very positive actions we can take to encourage businesses to come here, to encourage businesses to expand here.""\Still, there is ""a tremendous amount of apprehension"" among small-business owners about the makeup of Maine's next Legislature, said David Clough, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business in Maine.\With Democrats holding a majority in both the House and Senate, the fear is that businesses will suffer a flood of onerous policy changes that Democrats have been waiting eight years to unleash upon them with LePage serving as the dam, he said.\""That's going to create a lot of turmoil and a lot of angst,"" Clough said.\Some in the business community remain hopeful that Mills will act as a moderating force, if not quite the pro-business champion LePage has been, he said. They are waiting for her to offer reassurances that the Mills administration will not bring about a radical departure from the status quo.\Dana Connors, president of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, said Mills seems to share many of the top priorities of his organization.\""Health care, opioid concerns, dealing with our people, also the workforce issue, the broadband issue, things that really help strengthen our economy but also improve the lives of people,"" he said. ""They are frankly issues that should unite all of us regardless of our party affiliation.""\PUBLIC\ EDUCATION\Goals - increase teacher pay, set up universal pre-K\Mills, the daughter of a public high school teacher, has already identified a number of education priorities.\On the campaign trail, she said she would support increasing starting teacher pay at $40,000 a year, and would prioritize early childhood education programs, including universal pre-K, which is not currently mandated.\Mills said she would work to meet a 2004 voter mandate that the state pay 55 percent of the cost of K-12 education, a goal never reached.\The state's funding formula, which divvies up state education funds for the local districts, can fall short and the fact is that many communities are regularly asked to increase taxes to meet local education budgets when state funding falls short. Mills has suggested easing the burden on property tax payers by increasing the circuit-breaker program, or fully funding the revenue sharing program - both sharply curtailed under LePage.\Mills has emphasized that she wants to take a collaborative approach and see departments work together to reach policy goals.\ ""I am about getting things done,"" said Mills, who has four grandchildren in the public school system. ""It's deeply in my DNA to help the public education system in Maine.""\Mills also said she opposes using tax dollars for new charter schools, and wouldn't support lifting the current 10-school cap on charter schools.\For higher education, Mills said she would focus on increasing completion rates and reducing student debt.\Under LePage, a number of education bills with bipartisan support were vetoed by the governor, and Democratic lawmakers on the education committee say they are hopeful some of those ideas will be supported under Mills.\Sen. Rebecca Millett, D-Cape Elizabeth, said early childhood programs are a priority for her, including universal pre-K. She also hoped a Democratic-led State House would support two education bonds that were vetoed by LePage, one for school construction and one for equipment for career training and education programs.\Rep. Victoria Kornfield, D-Bangor, said she also wanted to emphasize universal pre-K, and also resubmit a bill for comprehensive training and support to train administrators and build up a deeper bench for district and school leaders.\Steve Bailey, executive director of the Maine School Management Association, said the issues he expects to surface are programs to support the social and emotional health of students, which ties in directly with Mills' plans to address the opioid epidemic, and the new regional school service centers, which districts must join or have their state funding cut.\Mills also is proposing a state-sponsored job training program open to anyone, including those without a high school diploma, to get certificates or badges. The programs would be ""intense training for six to eight week(s)"" to prepare workers for entry-level jobs in high-demand fields, such as hospitality, construction or health care.\THE OPIOID\ CRISIS\'The first time I've been optimistic in eight years.'\Mills campaigned on a comprehensive, 10-point plan to alleviate the opioid crisis.\Dr. Lisa Letourneau, associate medical director of Maine Quality Counts, a health advocacy group, said she advised Mills on the opioid plan, and she's optimistic it will work to ease the crisis. More than one Mainer per day has died of drug overdose deaths over the past two years, with 418 deaths in 2017. The opioid crisis has affected many aspects of public health, including Maine having more drug-affected babies and more patient use of emergency rooms for overdoses.\""The state has not had a plan to address the opioid epidemic,"" Letourneau said. ""Mills' plan hits all the key points, including treatment and prevention.""\Mills' plan would hike reimbursement rates for methadone treatment, boost services in emergency departments to get patients help when they leave the hospital, increase treatment capability, improve access to the opioid antidote naloxone, expand drug courts and increase prevention programs in schools, among other efforts.\""This is the first time I've been optimistic in eight years,"" said Dr. Mary Dowd, who provides substance use disorder treatment for Catholic Charities and works at Milestone Recovery detox center in Portland. ""It all sounds very good, and she understands evidence-based treatment. We just can't be putting people in sober houses and hope that's going to fix things.""\Staff Writers Joe Lawlor, Kevin Miller, Noel Gallagher and J. Craig Anderson contributed to this report."

Victoria Kornfield, D-Bangor, said she also wanted to emphasize universal pre-kindergarten, and also resubmit a bill for comprehensive training and support to train administrators and build up a deeper bench for district and school leaders.\Steve Bailey, executive director of the Maine School Management Association, said the issues he expects to surface are programs to support students' social and emotional health, which ties in directly with Mills' plans to address the opioid epidemic, and the new regional school service centers, which districts must join or have their state funding cut.\Mills also is proposing a state-sponsored job training program open to anyone, including those without a high school diploma, to get certificates or badges. The programs would be ""intense training for six to eight week(s)"" to prepare workers for entry-level jobs in high-demand fields, such as hospitality, construction or health care. \Mills campaigned on a comprehensive, 10-point plan to alleviate the opioid crisis.\Dr. Lisa Letourneau, associate medical director of Maine Quality Counts, a health advocacy group, said she advised Mills on the opioid plan, and she's optimistic it will work to ease the crisis. More than one Mainer per day has died of drug overdose deaths over the past two years, with 418 deaths occurring in 2017. The opioid crisis has affected many aspects of public health, including Maine having more drug-affected babies and more patient use of emergency rooms for overdoses.\""The state has not had a plan to address the opioid epidemic,"" Letourneau said. ""Mills' plan hits all the key points, including treatment and prevention.""\Mills' plan would increase reimbursement rates for methadone treatment, boost services in emergency departments to get patients help when they leave the hospital, increase treatment capability, improve access to the opioid antidote naloxone, expand drug courts and increase prevention programs in schools, among other efforts.\""This is the first time I've been optimistic in eight years,"" said Dr. Mary Dowd, who provides substance use disorder treatment for Catholic Charities and works at the Milestone Recovery detoxification center in Portland. ""It all sounds very good, and she understands evidence-based treatment. We just can't be putting people in sober houses and hope that's going to fix things.""\Maine Sunday Telegram staff writers Joe Lawlor, Kevin Miller, Noel Gallagher and Craig Anderson contributed to this report.\Credit: By SCOTT THISTLE Maine Sunday Telegram"
362,"
Lewiston industrial roofer IRC installed solar panels on roofs all around New England -- multimillion-dollar, multi-megawatt projects -- but never converted its own headquarters to solar.
\
Until last week.
\
Time and price were finally right.
\
Leaders of Saint Dominic Academy in Auburn started contemplating solar power two years ago. In December, they installed a $325,000 system that's expected to almost halve the school's energy bill.
\
And with a pair of awards last month, the Maine Public Utilities Commission spurred more than $100 million worth of investment in two commercial solar projects expected to power thousands of homes within two years.
\
Solar power remains a tiny fraction of the energy market in Maine, but there's no question that business is booming here.
\
Converts cite the environment, the savings, even the pope.
\
""Yes, it's less expensive to pull oil out of the ground and light it on fire, there's no question,"" said Kurt Penney, a business development executive at Industrial Roofing Companies, which includes IRC's Solar Roof Systems. ""And yet, that's not really a sustainable future.""
\
At his company, solar system costs have dropped 70 percent in six years. The upfront investment is expensive but increasingly within reach.
\
""It's an exciting time,"" he said. ""If you look back eight years, (the solar industry) would be hardly recognizable from what it is today. We all feel like eight years from now, it may be the same thing, that this will be de rigueur: You build a house, you're going to figure out which way the sun is shining.""
\
December surprise
\
To set the solar scene, Maine has 18.6 megawatts of installed solar capacity; 33 states have more, 16 less, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. (Within New England, everyone is ahead of Maine -- Massachusetts by leaps and bounds. See graphic.)
\
In 2013, 42 Maine companies worked in solar (installers, parts manufacturers, lawyers). That's now up to 50 and those companies employed 400 people in 2015.
\
Put in perspective, solar represents less than 1 percent of the power mix in Maine. There's 70 times more wind here and 200 times more hydropower, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
\
Solar energy and other renewable energy sources in the U.S. received a boost in 2006 with a 30 percent federal investment tax credit, which was due to expire in 2016. In what Bloomberg News called a surprise move, Congress extended that tax credit in December so it now stretches through 2019 with a three-year step-down after that, leaving people like Penney to believe, with prices falling and the tax break secure, the time for solar is now.
\
""It's a whole new conversation; it's a whole new world out there,"" he said. ""Those of us in the solar industry were very concerned (about the expiring tax break) -- 30 percent off the top is a pretty significant number to start your spreadsheets.""
\
In 2013, 23,020 Maine tax returns, or 3 percent of all returns, claimed the tax credit for renewable projects like solar, IRS spokesman Michael Dobzinski said.
\
Why that 30 percent matters so much: Residential systems start around $10,000.
\
Fortunat Mueller, co-founder of ReVision Energy in Portland, the state's largest solar installation company, said his company handled between 600 and 700 projects last year.
\
""Company-wide, we installed as much solar in 2015 as we did in 2013 and 2014 combined,"" said Mueller. ""Most of our customers are shooting to capture between 60 to 80 percent of their total electric load with the solar. Sometimes you run out of roof before you can do that, or sometimes you run out of budget.""
\
A typical 16-panel residential system costs between $12,000 and $14,000 and will generate 4,000 watts a month, enough to cover two-thirds of the average Maine household's monthly energy use, Mueller said.
\
The savings payback to cover that investment can be 11 years or fewer, depending on the home, according to Mueller.
\
Five years ago, that same system cost $20,000-$25,000.
\
The cost of silicon in the panels has ""come down dramatically,"" Mueller said. ""The biggest thing is the maturation of the industry and scale. A lot of (the panels) are also being made in cheaper places around the world than they used to be. They used to all be made in Germany. Now they're all made out in Asia.""
\
At IRC, which is the only firm in the state exclusively installing panels on commercial roofs, business has been similarly brisk.
\
""In the past seven years, we've more than doubled the number of employees and more than tripled our revenues -- it's been a good run,"" said President Mike Davis. ""(We're) targeting nearly a 50 percent growth this year over last year in our solar business.""
\
The new $75,000 solar array covering its 10,000-square-foot warehouse roof on Ferry Road is expected to pay for itself in five years, after which Davis expects the company's energy bill to be cut in half.
\
""The payback reached a point that we were comfortable with making the investment,"" he said.
\
In the past 18 months, his company has installed 6 megawatts of commercial solar in several projects, much of it in Massachusetts, a solar powerhouse. That state has the sixth-most installed solar in the country, according to the Energy Information Administration, a distinction spurred by a slate of state-specific incentives.
\
There's an argument that Maine's solar market could grow faster if Maine were a little more Massachusetts.
\
Gov. Paul LePage doesn't see it that way.
\
""It always comes down to the price that you pay for it,"" said Patrick Woodcock, director of the Governor's Energy Office. ""The details are important when you say, 'Are you supportive of hydro?' or, 'Are you supportive of wind?' Well, what is the price the developer wants to sell the power for? The governor's position has been that he's technologically neutral and price-sensitive.""
\
When crafting an energy rebate through Efficiency Maine, which draws funding from all electric ratepayers, the goal is to benefit the most people, he said. ""I think everyone would agree that we don't want a solar policy that just the affluent benefit from.""
\
""Massachusetts has virtually no wind installed; we have more than half of all the wind installed in New England in the state of Maine,"" Woodcock said. ""If they're going to look at renewables, they're not going to put a wind tower up on Beacon Hill in Boston. So I do push back on, 'Is Maine falling behind on installations?' I think a better metric is, 'What is our total renewable portfolio in comparison to these other states?'""
\
In 2014, 60 percent of Maine's net electricity generation came from wind, hydro, biomass or solar, according to the Energy Information Administration. Less than 10 percent of Massachusetts' did.
\
Even with no Maine incentives, with the federal incentive in hand, Maine is poised to take a giant leap on the commercial front.
\
On the horizon
\
The Maine Public Utilities Commission in late December ordered Central Maine Power and Emera Maine to enter long-term contracts with Dirigo Solar and a Clear Energy-Cianbro Development Corp. partnership, launching both of those commercial solar developments.
\
Clear Energy and Cianbro are teaming up on a 9.8-megawatt project above Belfast that will cover 50 acres with solar panels, according to a spokesman who declined to reveal the size of the investment.
\
It's expected to be online before the end of the year, powering ""a couple thousand homes.""
\
Meanwhile, the $100 million Dirigo Solar project is massive -- up to 75 megawatts spread out among solar farms around the state -- and led in part by a Bates College graduate.
\
The Clear Energy/Cianbro project was awarded under the state's renewable energy pilot program; price was a factor, but so was source.
\
For the much larger Dirigo Solar project, the contract was cost-driven. The sun won the day.
\
""They were competing against any kind of project, not necessarily a renewable. Could have been gas, could have been hydro, whatever,"" said PUC spokesman Harry Lanphear.
\
Maine ratepayers are forecast to save between $3 million and $26 million over the life of that 20-year contract.
\
Dirigo Solar spokesman Ted O'Meara said the project is expected to cover 500 acres around the state in solar panels (more formally known as ""photovoltaic arrays""); potential sites have been identified in each county. Details are expected later this year and the entire project is expected to come online by the end of 2017.
\
A new company, Dirigo Solar is headed by Brian Murphy and Nicholas Mazuroski, a Bates College grad. Quadrupling the amount of solar power in the state is the company's first major project.
\
In Auburn, St. Dom's wrapped up the largest solar project so far in the Twin Cities last month: 350 panels on its academic building roof. For the next six years, the panels are officially owned by ReVision Energy, which receives the credit for the tax break and will charge St. Dom's 11 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity in a purchase power agreement, according to Carl Young, the school's director of operations. (St. Dom's has been paying CMP between 10 and 15 cents.)
\
In year seven, St. Dom's will buy the system for $170,000, Young said. He hopes to launch a fundraiser with families adopting a panel for around $400 each.
\
Over the system's 40-year life, ""we anticipate that it is going to satisfy about 40 percent of our energy needs with solar,"" Young said.
\
The school spends on average $48,000 a year on electricity. At current rates, the savings would be $18,000 a year.
\
""We feel that as a school, as an academic institution, part of our mission is to teach kids to be responsible with the environment,"" Young said. ""The pope's encyclical said that the Catholic church needs to be responsible for the environment and so this is part of meeting that mission. The third part is operating costs. It reduces the operating costs and reduces our dependency on CMP.""
\
Jeff Marks, executive director of the Environmental & Energy Technology Council of Maine, is hosting a forum on Feb. 3 in Hallowell to dive into all things solar, including an upcoming report from the PUC on an increasingly contentious issue called ""net metering,"" the system of mostly smaller, residential solar systems feeding surplus electricity into the grid, banking it and drawing the credit down later.
\
Right now, homeowners receive back one kilowatt-hour for every one they bank. Utilities argue that they're shouldering costs and want to see a change in that one-for-one rate.
\
The forum also will explore smaller commercial projects proposed in places including Gouldsboro and Winslow.
\
""I think generally the future for solar in Maine is getting a little brighter,"" Marks said.

363,"This is in response to a letter by Jamie Beaulieu (Apr. 17) in support of CMP’s corridor project.\While I think most people would agree that domestically produced power is best for the environment and for the integrity of the grid, Beaulieu was off base with his reasoning. When Massachusetts passed an aggressive renewable energy mandate, nearly 50 projects bid to provide power to help achieve that goal. The NECEC isn’t even the only way for them to tap into Hydro-Quebec’s energy pool.\Similar projects were also proposed in New Hampshire and Vermont. The Northern Pass in New Hampshire was ultimately struck down to protect the iconic White Mountains region. But in Vermont, the permitting process is very transparent, with lots of public input, a more robust benefits package and, most importantly, the project would be buried underground. That would be safer, less damaging to the environment and wouldn’t degrade the scenic value of the area. But it would cost more money. That’s the real reason Massachusetts regulators would rather buy power from CMP through Maine, not Vermont.\The truth is, renewable sources right here in New England would be stifled. That includes expanded solar grids with net-metering, tide and wave power technologies and Maine’s own bio-mass industry would suffer.\The bottom line is Massachusetts needs to beef up its own supply of renewable domestic energy. There is no reason for Maine to bear the burden for southern New England’s energy demands. Maine’s wilderness is worth more than pennies on the dollar.\John Meagher, North Berwick"
364,"As a long-term member and past board member of the Natural Resource Council of Maine, I have tremendous respect for the decades of work they have done and continue to do to protect Maine's environment. But I think their opposition to the proposed New England Clean Energy Connect as described in the recent column by Dylan Vorhees, is a serious strategic mistake from a climate perspective (""CMP's history breeds skepticism on clean energy initiatives,"" Nov. 17). \While I agree with NRCM's frustration with Central Maine Power's pas opposition to solar net metering and energy efficiency, this is a Massachusetts-initiated plan to meet the state's clean energy goals. While many ask ""What's in it for Maine?"", reducing greenhouse gases is a global necessity unrelated to state boundaries. The fact that CMP would profit from the power line that would connect HydroQuebec and Massachusetts and the New England Electric Grid is a way to demonize CMP and undermine the project, but it is absolutely irrelevant in the context of the looming climate crisis. \In fact, every manufacturer or installer of clean energy resources, including wind and solar, will need to be very profitable to sustain and expand their essential work while researching technological improvements. These are investor-owned or privately held companies. Ironically, the same people who deride CMP for their profit motives never demonize the natural gas industry and the owners of aging fossil fuel power plants, both threatened with huge financial losses if the project is approved. The fossil fuel interests have for years been vocal opponents of this project, which is very telling.\The claim made by Voorhees that the proposed transmission line project ""will do nothing to reduce climate-disrupting pollution"" is unsupported by any available facts. Information provided by HydroQuebec shows that in addition to current reservoir reserves behind their dams, the 2020 opening of new generating facilities and the ongoing turbine upgrades are more than enough to meet the 1090 megawatt hours set forth in the contract with Massachusetts. Since HydroQuebec is government owned and active in international climate initiatives, I see no reason to distrust their numbers. Independent analysts hired by the Maine Public Utilities Commission testified that the transmission line would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 3 million metric tons each year, or the annual equivalent of tailpipe emissions created by 660,000 cars. When opponents claim that the project will have no climate benefit, it suggests that Massachusetts is just trying to meet their law defining clean energy goals but that they are just stupid or really don't care about climate change.\Voorhees references the need to meet Maine's current goal to reduce hydrocarbon emissions to 75 percent to 80 percent below 2003 levels by 2050, a good goal that NRCM helped develop. But the recent and frightening U.N. climate report suggests that globally we must reduce emissions 45 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050 to avoid climate chaos. \I find it hard to believe that we can meet either of these emission reduction goals without imported hydropower and by just adding more solar panels, inoffensive wind turbines, and offshore wind that will require above-ground power lines when underwater cables reach the shore. Furthermore, hydropower is a critical resource as backup to the significant seasonal and daily variability of wind and solar, and that backup role is now provided by fossil fuel plants. Meeting essential emission reduction goals requires the electrification of all forms of transportation and the conversion of fossil fuel heating of houses and other buildings to heat pumps. This requires a huge amount of all sources of clean electricity including that provided by Canadian hydropower. \We urgently need a quantifiable and aggressive decarbonization plan and any such a plan will no doubt create some local opposition. Our children and grandchildren will be far more deeply offended if we don't implement such a plan very soon. NRCM, HydroQuebec, Massachusetts, CMP and others need to cooperate to implement the project in a way that minimizes local environment impact and maximizes the far more important reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

366,"Nearly all members of the Portland community have been (in some way) affected by opiate use and overdose. Opiate addiction has become humanized, and has emerged as a public health issue - not just a problem for the criminal justice system to solve. It is now known that behavioral and medication-assisted treatments, not punishments, are the front-line approaches to addressing this epidemic. \As a master of social work graduate in the substance use field, I have seen treatments work, and I've celebrated with overdose survivors as they gained stable employment, relationships and housing and became eager to give back to a state that provided so much during their times of need. \Equally as often, I'm faced with difficult conversations in which those seeking supports are denied because of inadequate insurance coverage and the cost of care. The Affordable Care Act provides those struggling with addiction the best chance to access quality care, and treats those recovering from opiate use with compassion and dignity. So far, it is the best coverage ever offered ... and it still isn't enough. \Any rollback to the ACA will deny treatment to more people. In short, we can anticipate that more young Mainers, unable to access effective treatments to safely manage their opiate use, will die. The opposite holds true, too: If, as a state, we decide to vote for Medicaid expansion in November, it is anticipated that more people battling addiction will have access to lifesaving treatment. \In my case, the personal is professional is political - decisions about health care coverage on the national scale affect the quality (and possibility) of life for the people I treat, and (in my personal life), the people I love. \Ellen Pogson Portland \So far, Trump's presidency is making America great again \I am so proud of our president, Donald John Trump! \He has brought all the Arab nations together to help eradicate the terrorists that are plaguing us around the world.

He has received commitments from the NATO nations to begin paying their fair share. His trip to Europe was a resounding success. \He is making America strong again. He is bringing respect back to America. He is bringing jobs back to America.

While every other state in New England has policies in place to promote solar, these legislators struggle to grasp the big picture, ignoring the benefits to all ratepayers of electricity produced by solar. \Public utilities commissions in states from Nevada to Minnesota to Vermont have determined that rooftop solar is a benefit to all ratepayers when all costs and benefits are accounted for, as the Brookings Institution concluded in its May 2016 report ""Rooftop solar: Net metering is a net benefit."" \We don't know yet the fate of the three bills currently being worked on by the energy committee in Augusta (L.D. 1373, L.D. 1444 and L.D. 1504), but what we do know for sure is that if the new Maine PUC ruling, scheduled to go into effect in 2018, is left in place, all ratepayers will be on the hook for at least $2 million over three years because of new billing systems and extra meters. And the existing solar industry in Maine will be in jeopardy. \And what are the ""big picture"" benefits of solar that accrue to all of us? They include good jobs and economic activity in struggling communities, decreased costs of peak demand energy purchases, decreased utility infrastructure costs and a cleaner environment that supports tourism. What's not to like? \We're poised to shoot ourselves in the foot ... again. If this matters at all to you, please reach out to your legislators. \Mary Ann Larson Portland \Trump's budget jeopardizes children, recreational areas \I'm concerned about President Trump's budget, which proposes funding cuts that would be detrimental to countless environmental research programs and be devastating to Maine's ecosystems (""Maine environmental advocates warn of 'crippling' cuts in Trump budget,"" May 24). \If approved, it would terminate the Casco Bay Partnership, among other significant programs, which would cease the environmental monitoring of Casco Bay's beaches and waters. Without safeguards, our children could be exposed to harmful air and water pollutants without us even knowing. \In addition, Trump's proposed budged underfunds action on environmental issues that matter to millions of Americans - like climate action, clean energy and our national parks. \Instead of turning back the clock on common-sense environmental and public health safeguards, we should be building a cleaner, greener, healthier future for all Mainers.

Preview of Thursday Augusta council meeting and expected vote.

The $3 million project would be financed by money generated at Hatch Hill, which accepts solid waste from several municipalities in the region. The landfill is expected to keep producing gas for at least 17 years, so the proposed new power-generating facility that would be built at Hatch Hill could result in the city saving money on its electricity bills once the cost of the project is recovered, while simultaneously benefiting the environment.\Hatch Hill already has a system that collects methane gas at the landfill to prevent it from escaping into and harming the environment. It is burned off by a flare. The proposed new system would use the gas generated at the landfill to produce electricity, for which the city would be compensated by Central Maine Power Co. with a credit toward electricity used at city facilities. The city plans to use the electricity officials expect the system to generate to offset the electric bills for the nine city buildings that use the most electricity.\Ralph St. Pierre, finance director and assistant city manager, said Tuesday the project is expected to pay for itself in 11 years and generate savings for the city whether controversial proposed new state ""net metering"" rules recommended by the state Public Utilities Commission are put in place or not.\The Pine Tree Landfill, in Hampden, owned by Casella Waste Systems, installed a system to convert trash to energy in 2008.\Officials of Woodard & Curran, an engineering firm working on the project for the city, said in a memo to the city that the project, including electrical generation equipment, a new building to house the equipment and other operations, and the extension of a gas line from the landfill collection system to the generators, could go out to bid in March ""... in anticipation of having the project operational and producing electricity (and saving money) for the city by December of 2018.""\The cost of the project, initially expected to be about $2 million, is now expected to be about $3 million. The size of the generation system also has increased since the idea first was hatched, from a 350-kilowatt generation system to a 550-kilowatt system. And revenue from the project is also higher than was estimated previously, in 2016, by about 40 percent -- in part because the city now proposes to collect methane gas from a newer section of the landfill, where a new methane collection system would be installed.\Councilors are due to vote at their 7 p.m. meeting Thursday on whether to authorize spending up to $3 million to build the system.\Councilors are also scheduled to:\[bullet] Consider authorizing the use of a $50,000 grant to Bond Brook Recreation Area; and\[bullet] Consider authorizing City Manager William Bridgeo to sign contracts negotiated with unions representing Augusta Civic Center employees and firefighters.\Credit: By KEITH EDWARDS Staff Writer"

The city plans to use the electricity officials expect the system to generate to offset the electric bills for the nine city buildings that use the most electricity.\Ralph St. Pierre, finance director and assistant city manager, said Tuesday the project is expected to pay for itself in 11 years and generate savings for the city whether controversial proposed new state ""net metering"" rules recommended by the state Public Utilities Commission are put in place or not.\The Pine Tree Landfill, in Hampden, owned by Casella Waste Systems, installed a system to convert trash to energy in 2008.\Officials of Woodard & Curran, an engineering firm working on the project for the city, said in a memo to the city that the project, including electrical generation equipment, a new building to house the equipment and other operations, and the extension of a gas line from the landfill collection system to the generators, could go out to bid in March ""... in anticipation of having the project operational and producing electricity (and saving money) for the city by December of 2018.""\The cost of the project, initially expected to be about $2 million, is now expected to be about $3 million. The size of the generation system also has increased since the idea first was hatched, from a 350-kilowatt generation system to a 550-kilowatt system. And revenue from the project is also higher than was estimated previously, in 2016, by about 40 percent -- in part because the city now proposes to collect methane gas from a newer section of the landfill, where a new methane collection system would be installed.\Councilors are scheduled to vote at their 7 p.m. meeting Thursday on whether to authorize spending up to $3 million, in Hatch Hill money, to build the system.\Councilors are also scheduled to:\[bullet] Consider approving their goals for the year;\[bullet] Consider authorizing the use of a $50,000 grant from Friends of Maine's Mountains and Blue Sky West for improvements to Bond Brook Recreation Area; and\[bullet] Consider authorizing City Manager William Bridgeo to sign contracts negotiated with labor unions representing Augusta Civic Center operations employees and firefighters.\Credit: By KEITH EDWARDS Staff Writer"
369,"AUGUSTA -- Swept to power in the 2018 elections, when they won control of both houses of the Legislature as well as the governor's office, Democrats arrived at the State House in January with a long list of objectives for the first lawmaking session.\For the previous eight years their priorities had been largely stymied by Republican Gov. Paul LePage and his conservative allies in the Legislature. But with Democratic Gov. Janet Mills at the helm, the progressive floodgates were opened and legislators submitted well over 2,400 proposals they wanted to become law.\From funding Medicaid expansion to setting stricter regulations on guns, more than 1,845 bills were printed. Although the final tally of how many will be signed into law is still not clear, many high-profile measures have already been enacted. Typically about a third of all bills make it through the legislative grinder and the governor's office. However, nonpartisan officials suspect the number will be higher this year.\Here's a look at some of the winners and losers from first session of the 129th Legislature:\T H E W I N N E R S\EXPANDED HEALTH CARE\Probably the biggest winners of 2019 were those pushing for expanded health care coverage for Maine's poorest people.\At least 70,000 more low-income Mainers will now be eligible for MaineCare coverage approved by voters in a statewide vote in 2016. LePage had five times vetoed expansions passed by the Legislature.\But moving forward with the ballot-box law was Job 1 for the new administration of Gov. Mills. who started her first day in office signing an executive order reversing course on the LePage administration's foot-dragging delays, legal battles and outright refusal to enact the new law.\""It's taken a long time,"" Robyn Merrill, the executive director of Maine Equal Justice, one of the top advocates for the expansion, said following the Mills executive order.\And despite LePage's long-term reluctance, Republicans in the Legislature this year worked with Democrats to fund the new law, including more than $200 million in the next two-year state budget to cover the expected state costs of $175 million, which will also draw down about $700 million a year in federal matching money, and pad the state's savings account with a contingency amount of $29 million, just in case cost estimates are off.\ABORTION RIGHTS\Maine's Legislature took a course opposite to that of several other states, especially those in the South, when it approved several abortion-related bills - always split on party lines. One allowed abortions to be covered by the state-funded health program, MaineCare; another allowed nurse practitioners and physician assistants to perform abortions; and a third improved access to the day-after pill by allowing it to be dispensed in vending machines.\Three other bills protecting a woman's right to an abortion or protecting the privacy of health care professionals who perform abortions were also signed into law by Mills.\""This year, the Maine Legislature took a giant step forward to ensure that a woman, regardless of income or where she lives, can make a decision about abortion that's best for her and her family,"" Nicole Clegg, vice president of public policy for the Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund and Planned Parenthood of Northern New England said late last week. ""Legislators made their opinions clear. Maine is a state where access to reproductive and sexual health care is essential to living a healthy, successful life and politicians shouldn't be putting up barriers to care.""\VACCINE ADVOCATES\Lawmakers, especially those in the state Senate, went back and forth over a bill that ended religious and philosophical exemptions for childhood vaccines, making the shots mandatory for all who want to attend school and college in Maine.\The new law, which will go into effect before school starts later this year, comes as Maine and other states around the nation are facing growing incidents of infectious disease outbreaks, which health officials have said could have been avoided with readily available vaccinations.\Maine, like other states, had seen an increasing number of parents opting out of vaccinating their children over concerns about side effects or over religious beliefs. But health officials countered that much of the concern is not founded in science and warned that a growing number of unvaccinated children are compromising so-called herd immunity. Especially at risk are children who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, such as those with compromised immune systems from fighting cancers.\Despite the protests of hundreds of parents who fought against ending the exemptions, and the objections of Republican lawmakers who argued the bill was unconstitutional, the Senate, by a single-vote margin, approved the bill and Mills soon thereafter signed it into law. Maine joins West Virginia, Mississippi, California and New York with a law requiring all school-age children to be vaccinated.\TAXPAYERS\Income and property taxpayers came out on top at the end of the 2019 lawmaking session. There were no new income tax increases and lawmakers agreed to expanded property-tax relief programs, including a measure increasing the state's Homestead Exemption to make the first $25,000 of value on primary residence exempt from local property taxes.\Another bill, sponsored by House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, and signed into law by Mills last week, creates a new property tax relief fund that will issue $100 checks to homeowners enrolled in the homestead program, once the fund has enough in it to do so.\Also, the nearly $8 billion state budget increases the amount of state tax dollars returned to municipalities as ""revenue sharing,"" with the goal of reducing pressure on local property taxes.\EDUCATION\Public schools and especially public-school teachers should come out ahead following the 2019 lawmaking session. Lawmakers agreed to boost public school funding by $115 million, bringing the state's share of funding to 51 percent of school costs, but still short of a voter mandate of 55 percent.\Lawmakers also set in place a plan to raise the minimum teacher salary to $40,000 a year statewide over the next three years, setting aside the funds to reimburse local school districts for those increases. The new budget also includes another $18 million for a revolving loan fund that provides money for local school infrastructure improvements and renovations. On top of that, lawmakers made more children eligible for free lunch and breakfast at school, eliminating the reduced lunch program and making all children that would have been eligible for that eligible for free lunch instead.\the ENVIRONMENT\""I think this is the best year for the environment at the State House in 20 years, hands down,"" Pete Didisheim, senior director of advocacy for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said Friday. ""There was more progress achieved on environmental issues than we could have imagined.""\Lawmakers voted to ban single-use plastic shopping bags and foam food/beverage containers, to lift size restrictions on ""community solar"" installations and to phase out the use of PFAS - so-called ""forever chemicals"" - in food packaging. And they did it, in most cases, with broad bipartisan support.\Mills also set - and the Legislature approved - ambitious state goals for working to address climate change. Maine's new official state goals are that, by 2050, 100 percent of the state's electricity will come from renewable sources and greenhouse gas emissions will be 80 percent below 1990 levels.\After battling with former Gov. LePage for years, solar installers were able to reinstate the ""net metering"" policy that provides financial incentives - in the form of bill credits - to homeowners with solar energy systems. Other bills will allow more homeowners or businesses to connect to a larger ""community solar"" project.\One major disappointment for land conservation advocates - including groups representing sportsmen - was the Legislature's failure to pass a bond package that included money for the Land for Maine's Future program. But LMF supporters are optimistic the Legislature will eventually send a bond package to voters.\""This has been a session of historic wins for the environment,"" said Beth Ahearn with Maine Conservation Voters. ""After eight years of inaction, we have seen policy-setting victories beginning with climate (change) and clean energy.""\TRIBAL-STATE RELATIONS\Mills came into office pledging to improve the state's (as well as her own) relationship with tribal leaders in Maine.\All parties report significant progress even as they acknowledge a long road ahead.\On Friday, Mills was surrounded by leaders from the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseets as she signed into law some of the nation's most protective water standards on newly designated ""sustenance fishing"" waters.\Mills has also signed bills banning Indian mascots or nicknames at Maine schools, changing the Columbus Day holiday to Indigenous People's Day and creating a task force to examine a decades-old disagreement over the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act.\Rena Newell, the Passamaquoddy representative to the Legislature, said the atmosphere in the State House has clearly improved since 2015, when her tribe and the Penobscot Nation withdrew their representatives. Newell said she hopes that momentum will carry forward into next year.\""This session we have definitely seen some movement,"" Newell said.\Penobscot Nation Ambassador Maulian Dana said leaders are optimistic given the collaborative work on such a broad range of both symbolic and substantive issues important to tribes.\""There definitely have been some bridges built,"" Dana said, noting the previous tensions with not only the LePage administration but also with Mills while she was attorney general. ""She has done a good job, her office has done a good job and the tribes have been open to working with them.""\""It's a new day,"" Mills said after signing the sustenance fishing bill.\GAMBLERS, POT SMOKERS\Starting as early as next spring, Mainers will be able to engage in two formerly illegal activities - betting on athletic events and buying pot - without fear of prosecution.\Lawmakers finally approved a complex set of rules to regulate the retail sale of recreational marijuana. And it's been a long time coming for legalization advocates, given that Maine voters opted to legalize personal possession, use and purchase of marijuana in November 2016.\And by the spring or summer of 2020, Mainers should be able to stroll into a casino, off-track betting parlor or pull up a mobile app to place a bet on athletic events happening around the world.\Maine is joining roughly a dozen states - with more expected to follow suit - that have legalized sports betting since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal prohibition last year.\To place a bet, you'll have to be at least 21 years old. The law currently authorizes Maine-based organizations to offer sports betting: Hollywood Casino in Bangor, Oxford Casino, Scarborough Downs, the four off-track betting facilities, and Maine's four Native American tribes.\But if the experiences of other states are any indication, the vast majority of bets in Maine will be placed online. And the biggest operator in mobile betting, DraftKings, is eager to get involved.\""We are hopeful that Governor Mills moves quickly to sign the bill to usher in an era of legal, regulated sports betting in the Pine Tree State,"" a DraftKings spokesman said in a statement.\VOTERS\Mainers will likely disagree whether several notable changes to Maine election voting systems - along with proposed changes that didn't make the cut - are winning or losing scenarios.\Arguably the biggest change will occur on March 3, when Maine joins more than a dozen other states holding presidential primaries. ""Super Tuesday"" is the first multi-state primary of the 2020 election, guaranteeing all-out media coverage of the results. But with voters in places like California, Texas, North Carolina and Virginia also casting ""Super Tuesday"" ballots, don't expect Maine to get too much attention.\The switch from caucuses to primaries is significant for some, particularly political die-hards who love the hyperlocal, party-building nature of the lengthy caucuses. But primaries typically draw out more voters.\New and young would-be voters will also find it easier to register to vote under another new law that automatically registers eligible Mainers when they interact with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles or some other state agencies.\But several other election-related changes sought by progressive groups failed or were shelved.\For instance, the House and Senate were at odds over a bill to add Maine to the list of states agreeing to use the national popular vote instead of the Electoral College in presidential elections.\Lawmakers also did not finalize a bill to allow voters to use the ranked-choice voting process when voting for presidential contenders during next March's primary and the November election. That bill is still technically alive, however, and could be voted on during a special session later this year.\SOCIAL ISSUES: CONVERSION THERAPY\Maine became the 17th state in the U.S. to ban the practice of ""conversion therapy"" when Mills signed into law a bill sponsored by Assistant Majority Leader Ryan Fecteau, D-Biddeford, prohibiting state-licensed counselors, psychologists, social workers, health professionals, guidance counselors, and pastoral and family therapists from engaging in conversion therapy.\The new law defines conversion therapy as ""any practice or treatment that seeks or claims to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including, but not limited to, any effort to change gender expression or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions, feelings or behavior toward others based on the individual's gender.""\SOCIAL ISSUES: SEXUAL ASSAULT AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE\Lawmakers approved and Mills signed into law a $5 million boost for organizations that provide counseling and other support services for the victims and survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence in Maine. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Erin Herbig, D-Belfast, was the first increase in state funding for domestic violence and sexual assault prevention and supports since 2000.\In the last 10 years, according to information provided by the Maine Coalition to End Domestic Violence, state support for the programs has actually been reduced from $1.6 million for domestic violence and $698,811 for sexual assault agencies in 2009 to $1 million and $579,273, respectively, in 2019.\Elizabeth Ward Saxl, executive director of the Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said the increased funds will also help draw down critical federal matching money at a time when demand for services for victims of both domestic violence and sexual assault is at an all-time high.\Also approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Mills is a bill protecting survivors of domestic violence from economic abuse, allowing them to shed debt wrongly incurred in their name by their abusers under a court order. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Jessica Fay, D-Raymond, prohibits credit rating agencies from counting that debt against them. The law puts Maine at the forefront in the nation when it comes to the issue of economic abuse and will allow a court, when issuing a protection from abuse order, to also issue an order for monetary relief, prohibiting debt collectors from calling or taking action, while also defining the term ""economic abuse"" in state law.\T H E L O S E R S\GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES\Gun control advocates were cautiously optimistic after the big Democratic wins at the polls last year. The 2019 session proved, however, that enacting progressive gun control measures is never easy in Maine.\Three years after voters rejected a universal background check proposal, supporters offered a modified version requiring criminal background checks before private sales at gun shows or in response to advertisements such as a listing in Uncle Henry's. The bill exempted gifts or transfers among family members, a major sticking point in the 2016 ballot initiative.\But the measure failed in both chambers. Even in the House, which has 89 Democrats this year, the bill received only 66 votes in support.\Lawmakers also rejected bills seeking to ban large-capacity ammunition magazines and to allow municipalities to ban guns at polling places or inside public buildings.\A version of the ""red flag"" gun legislation that has gained traction nationwide also failed in the Legislature. But a compromise bill that also aims to temporarily remove guns from dangerous individuals - via a different process - passed the Legislature and was signed into law by Mills.\That bill, L.D. 1811, allows police to order individuals to temporarily surrender their guns if a doctor or other medical professional determines they pose a significant threat to themselves or others. A judge would then review the case within 14 days and determine whether to return the firearms or order them held for up to a year.\The compromise was negotiated between the Mills administration, the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine and key lawmakers.\Geoffrey Bickford, executive director of the Maine Gun Safety Coalition, said his organization was obviously disappointed the original ""red flag"" bill didn't pass. But Bickford's group also supported the compromise bill because it still seeks to temporarily remove guns from people who are suicidal or pose a threat to others.\""That's what was addressed, albeit in a different way with the 'yellow paper' bill,"" Bickford said, referring to the ""protective custody"" process used in the legislation. ""So we are very happy.""\MOTORISTS\Maine drivers were also overall losers in the 2019 lawmaking session. Although the Legislature did not approve an increase in the state's gasoline tax, it failed to support a bill to repeal or lengthen to two years Maine's required annual vehicle inspection program. Of the 35,000 motor vehicle accidents logged each year in Maine, about 1,050 accidents, or 3 percent of the total, involve a vehicle defect as a contributing factor, according to testimony from Maine State Police Lt. Bruce Scott, who oversees the inspection program.\Drivers who like to talk on the phone also lost out under a new law that will make it illegal to drive and talk, without using a hands-free device. A first offense will cost $50 with repeated offenders risking as much as a $500 fine and three-month license suspension.\But motorists are winners, too. Sen. Bill Diamond, D-Windham, the chief sponsor of the bill, who has pushed for years for a hands-free law, said he has no doubt Maine's highways will be safer because of it.\Motorists may also lose out when it comes to the quality of the state's highways and bridges, as lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a bond package that included $110 million for transportation improvements statewide. That work is so important that Mills may call lawmakers back for a special session later this year in an attempt to get a bond package passed.\CITY OF PORTLAND\Busloads of asylum seekers from African nations who crossed the southern U.S. border have arrived in the city of Portland in the last two weeks, taxing the city's emergency shelter capacity and its ability to pay for services. City officials were hoping the Legislature would repeal a LePage-era rule that prohibits municipalities from using state funds from General Assistance programs on non-citizens.\But those hopes were dashed when the bill failed to gain enough support and was carried over to the next legislative session.\Portland was also the largest municipal loser on a bill that would have allowed cities and towns to add a 1 percent local option sales tax. Had that measure passed, Portland could have collected an additional $16 million a year in tax revenue. Although the bill was scaled back to be applied only to restaurant meals and lodging, which would have generated about $3 million a year, it failed to gain legislative support.\Kevin Miller -- 207-791-6312\kmiller@pressherald.com\Twitter: KevinMillerPPH\Scott Thistle -- 207-791-6330\sthistle@pressherald.com\Twitter: thisdog"
370,"LEWISTON -- As he loaded plastic bags full of groceries into his car, Roger Potvin said he was in favor of banning them.\""I hate them,"" he said, adding that so much plastic ""is stupid. You hear about how they hurt the fish in the ocean all the time.""\Outlawing plastic grocery bags is good, the Lewiston resident said, ""because if they're not around, we won't use them. The problem is, they're so convenient. But we don't need them. We can bring our own bags.""\The Maine Legislature this year passed a law banning single-use plastic bags. It will take effect on Earth Day (April 22) 2020. The ban was supported by the Maine Grocers Association and the Maine Retail Association, in part out of concerns that various municipal bans would make compliance difficult. Retailers wanted consistency.\Consumers are becoming aware ""that plastic pollution is big,"" said Pete Didisheim of the Natural Resources Council of Maine. Worldwide, 1 million plastic bags are distributed per minute.\""We use those bags for five minutes,"" Didisheim said. ""Then the plastic lasts for hundreds of years.""\In her State of the State address in February, Gov. Janet Mills said the environment and fighting climate change were a priority for her, and that her administration was working on a climate agenda. Without additional tax dollars, she pledged the state would help with the research and development of offshore wind power, provide incentives for community and residential solar power, promote energy efficiency and weatherization, increase the use of heat pumps, build charging stations and create incentives for electric vehicles, and help local and state governments become more ""green.""\All of that, and more, happened after that address.\Since then, Maine has joined the U.S. Climate Alliance and withdrawn from the Outer Continental Shelf Governors Coalition, which wanted to drill offshore for oil and gas. Mills has announced that Maine will create the Maine Offshore Wind Initiative, a state-based effort to identify offshore wind development in the Gulf of Maine, and will work to develop offshore wind power with New Hampshire and Massachusetts in a federally led Gulf of Maine Intergovernmental Regional Task Force.\Highlights of environmental laws passed by state lawmakers in the recent session include:\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\""We are reviewing the law to develop a thoughtful strategy for how to achieve the goal,"" said Michael Stoddard of Efficiency Maine.\\n\\During the legislative session Mills also announced an initiative by her administration to use $5.1 million from a settlement with Volkswagen to develop new Efficiency Maine programs that would provide rebates for the purchase of electric cars and the installation of electric car chargers across Maine.\Bonnie Washuk -- 207-689-2806\bwashuk@sunjournal.com"
371,"From building the state's largest municipal solar array to taking on an international oil company, Maine's fourth-largest city just might be its most environmentally active.\ \SOUTH PORTLAND — The mood was hopeful last week as 14 municipal officials and environmental leaders from across Maine discussed the status of several solar proposals making their way through the Legislature this session.\City and town representatives from York to Gardiner to Tremont were on a conference call organized by Julie Rosenbach, South Portland’s sustainability director. Since 2015, Rosenbach has overseen the city’s pursuit of a healthy environment, a strong community and a competitive economy.\Sandy Carder, a Gray town councilor, was among the officials listening in. Her town is planning to develop a solar array on its capped former landfill. She tuned in to learn from other communities that already have gone through the process. That includes South Portland, a city of more than 25,000 people that topped its former landfill with the state’s largest municipal solar array in 2017.\“We’ve really appreciated all the information sharing,” Carder said while introducing herself to others on the call.\“When you’re a small town, starting a project from scratch takes a lot of resources,” Carder explained later. “The information sharing, networking and plugging into what’s going on in Augusta — it’s all unusually helpful.”\This year, 17 cities and towns across Maine have formed a coalition, led by South Portland, to help pursue legislation that would make it easier for municipalities to develop solar facilities and other projects geared toward increasing sustainability, lowering costs and reducing carbon footprints.\Members of the Municipal Energy Priorities group are Portland, South Portland, Falmouth, Scarborough, Denmark, Sebago, Gray, Gardiner, St. Agatha, Bristol, Chelsea, Tremont, Fayette, Rockland, Camden, Bath and York, plus Cumberland County.\Officials from more than a dozen other communities are listening in, receiving email updates and keeping track in other ways, including Lewiston, Belfast, Bar Harbor, Ellsworth, Freeport, Kittery, Mount Desert, Sanford, Stockton Springs, Windham and Yarmouth. Representatives of groups such as the Natural Resources Council of Maine and Maine Conservation Voters are participating and providing information.\Forming the coalition solidified South Portland’s standing as a statewide leader in sustainable policymaking and practices, which basically take into account the preservation of natural resources.\The city’s efforts have included curbing the use of plastics and pesticides; promoting development of walkable neighborhoods with affordable, energy-efficient housing; and facing down an international oil company in an ongoing federal lawsuit.\ \SHARING EXPERTISE\In recent years, Maine’s fourth-largest city has made a point of sharing its experience with other municipalities, recognizing that few communities in a mostly rural state can afford to staff a sustainability office. There are a handful in Maine, including Portland, Scarborough and Falmouth.\“Other people like sustainability in concept, but when it comes to spending the money, it’s harder to keep people engaged and committed,” Rosenbach said. She was the sustainability manager at Bates College in Lewiston for eight years before taking the job in South Portland. Before that, she was a waste reduction specialist for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, D.C.\Rosenbach has asked for a budget increase this spring, from $112,080 in fiscal 2019, which ends June 30, to $141,674 for fiscal 2020, largely so her part-time assistant, Lucy Brennan, could work full time for the city.\Mayor Claude Morgan, who heads South Portland’s City Council, said Rosenbach probably will get more than she asked for so Brennan can start working full time in July rather than wait until January 2020.\Morgan said he’s glad Rosenbach’s outreach and the city’s experience in environmental action are benefiting other municipalities.\“While it’s costing us to develop that knowledge, it doesn’t cost us anything to give it away,” Morgan said. “We sort of have a moral obligation to do the right thing and to share it.”\Gray, a town north of Portland with more than 8,000 residents, has benefited from South Portland’s generosity for nearly a year.\“We’ve been talking about going solar for a while, but we didn’t really gain any traction until we visited South Portland’s array last June,” said Carder, the town councilor. “We saw what they’ve done and thought, ‘This could really work for us.’”\ \BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY\South Portland has been at the forefront of environmental action for more than a decade, taking steps to address climate change that have involved nearly every city department and touched every resident.\The city’s efforts are based on the premise that scientists say carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases produced by burning fossil fuels and other human activity are contributing to a warming atmosphere, melting ice caps and glaciers, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, changing weather patterns and other conditions related to accelerated climate change. It’s also generally accepted and stated without debate at public meetings that single-use plastics and many synthetic chemicals are bad for the environment and human health.\The City Council has passed a ban on foam food containers, a 5-cent fee on single-use shopping bags and a pesticide ordinance that’s on track to be expanded to include synthetic fertilizers in the coming months.\The city also has leased electric cars and installed public charging stations, added food waste collection to its recycling program, nearly finished converting its streetlights to energy-saving LED fixtures, and completed a multimillion-dollar sewer and storm drain separation project to protect Casco Bay, well ahead of many other communities.\Then there’s the 2,944-panel solar array that South Portland started operating in 2017. Built by ReVision Energy, of Portland, it’s designed to generate 1.2 million kilowatt-hours of energy per year, or roughly 12 percent of the electricity used by the city’s municipal and school buildings.\Portland, Maine’s largest city, with more than 66,000 residents, has since completed a slightly smaller array on its landfill. Under solar contracts negotiated in tandem, each city will purchase electricity from ReVision at higher-than-market rates for the first six years, before being able to buy the solar equipment outright for nearly $1.6 million.\The neighboring cities have collaborated on many environmental initiatives, developed with Troy Moon, Portland’s sustainability chief. Most recently, each city has allocated $110,000 to share a consultant and develop individual community-based plans to deal with climate change effects, including sea-level rise at the edge of Casco Bay.\ \GOING IT ALONE\But it’s South Portland’s willingness to take on big-ticket environmental challenges that sets it apart from other Maine cities and towns. In 2014, the City Council passed the so-called Clear Skies ordinance, which banned the bulk loading of crude oil into tankers in Portland Harbor because of potential air quality and health impacts.\The controversial ordinance effectively blocked the Portland Pipe Line Corp. from reversing the flow of its pipeline, which has carried foreign crude from harbor terminals South Portland to Montreal refineries since World War II. The ordinance anticipated the day when demand for foreign crude would dry up and the company might want to use the pipeline to bring Canadian tar sands oil south.\Now the pipeline is largely unused and the company, a Canadian-owned subsidiary of ExxonMobil, Shell and Suncor Energy, is challenging the ordinance in federal court. The city hired a Boston law firm and has so far spent $2.4 million fighting the 2015 lawsuit, including $174,000 donated by residents and others.\The city won the first round in U.S. District Court in Portland last year, when a judge ruled that South Portland had the right to enact the zoning, that it didn’t violate the Constitution and that it acted in keeping with the city’s comprehensive plan. The company filed a notice of intent to appeal the decision in November.\Last month, the city learned that the EPA filed a federal lawsuit and consent decree against Global Partners LP, a Fortune 500 company that operates a fuel storage facility on the banks of the Fore River.\The EPA charged Global with violating the federal Clean Air Act and its emissions license issued by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. Global and Maine DEP officials dispute the EPA’s findings, but the lawsuit has called attention to a variety of pollution, odor, traffic and other community concerns related to more than 100 bulk oil storage tanks and other petroleum facilities in the city.\The city has hired a second set of lawyers to respond to the EPA lawsuit and consent decree. And after hearing unanimous calls for action at two recent public meetings on the issue, the city is developing plans to establish its own air-quality monitoring program.\“The situation with Global has emphasized that we really need to be doing it ourselves because we don’t want surprises,” said Morgan, South Portland’s mayor. “This is happening in our own backyards.”\ \MAINE’S ‘GREENEST’ CITY?\Asked if South Portland’s environmental activism makes it the “greenest” city in Maine, Morgan declined to quantify what he said really cannot be measured.\Morgan noted that the city has been on a path to sustainability since 2007, the last time he was mayor, when the city signed on to the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection agreement, which set a goal to reduce carbon emissions below 1990 levels.\South Portland’s Municipal Climate Action Plan, adopted in 2014, called for city operations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2017, which the city exceeded by 6 percentage points in advance of the deadline.\Now the city is aiming to use 100 percent clean renewable energy for municipal operations by 2040, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent citywide by 2050 through increased efficiency, conservation and renewable energy initiatives.\Another citywide goal is to increase South Portland’s recycling rate from about 29 percent to 40 percent by 2020 through a campaign to encourage purposeful buying, reuse, recycling and composting.\With the statewide municipal coalition, Rosenbach is promoting the following legislative initiatives:\• Revise net metering rules so municipal solar arrays can exceed the current 660-kilowatt size limit and have more than nine off-site meters or users, among other changes.\• Update Maine’s Uniform Building and Energy Code so cities and towns can develop so-called stretch codes, which phase in stricter requirements for energy-efficient construction.\• Improve access to energy-use data from utility companies for municipalities that have adopted so-called benchmarking ordinances, including Portland and South Portland. This would allow them to more easily monitor energy consumption in large buildings and provide incentives for business owners to make energy-efficient renovations.\ \CHANGE NOT EASY\Not everyone likes what South Portland is doing. Online comments on news stories indicate that some people see the city’s fight against the pipeline and its effort to curb petroleum pollution as foolish, anti-business and wasting tax dollars.\Some business owners said they opposed benchmarking because they don’t want to share their energy information or be forced to upgrade their buildings. Some homeowners said they don’t want the city telling them what chemicals they can use in their yards.\Morgan and Rosenbach are convinced by the turnout at public meetings and the feedback they get on the street that the vast majority of residents support the city’s efforts. A local citizens group, Protect South Portland, actively campaigns for various sustainability initiatives and its members have contributed a significant amount of money to fight the pipeline lawsuit.\“(Opposition is) a realistic part of change,” Rosenbach said. “I totally understand people have their own perspectives. But I think most people want to live in a sustainable community. So I try to approach my job in a practical way. I try to meet people where they are and move them forward.”"
372,"From building the state's largest municipal solar array to taking on an international oil company, Maine's fourth-largest city just might be its most environmentally active.\South Portland might be state’s most environmentally active in state\ \SOUTH PORTLAND — The mood was hopeful last week as 14 municipal officials and environmental leaders from across Maine discussed the status of several solar proposals making their way through the Legislature this session.\City and town representatives from York to Gardiner to Tremont were on a conference call organized by Julie Rosenbach, South Portland’s sustainability director. Since 2015, Rosenbach has overseen the city’s pursuit of a healthy environment, a strong community and a competitive economy.\Sandy Carder, a Gray town councilor, was among the officials listening in. Her town is planning to develop a solar array on its capped former landfill. She tuned in to learn from other communities that already have gone through the process. That includes South Portland, a city of more than 25,000 people that topped its former landfill with the state’s largest municipal solar array in 2017.\“We’ve really appreciated all the information sharing,” Carder said while introducing herself to others on the call.\“When you’re a small town, starting a project from scratch takes a lot of resources,” Carder explained later. “The information sharing, networking and plugging into what’s going on in Augusta — it’s all unusually helpful.”\This year, 17 cities and towns across Maine have formed a coalition, led by South Portland, to help pursue legislation that would make it easier for municipalities to develop solar facilities and other projects geared toward increasing sustainability, lowering costs and reducing carbon footprints.\Members of the Municipal Energy Priorities group are Portland, South Portland, Falmouth, Scarborough, Denmark, Sebago, Gray, Gardiner, St. Agatha, Bristol, Chelsea, Tremont, Fayette, Rockland, Camden, Bath and York, plus Cumberland County.\Officials from more than a dozen other communities are listening in, receiving email updates and keeping track in other ways, including Lewiston, Belfast, Bar Harbor, Ellsworth, Freeport, Kittery, Mount Desert, Sanford, Stockton Springs, Windham and Yarmouth. Representatives of groups such as the Natural Resources Council of Maine and Maine Conservation Voters are participating and providing information.\Forming the coalition solidified South Portland’s standing as a statewide leader in sustainable policymaking and practices, which basically take into account the preservation of natural resources.\The city’s efforts have included curbing the use of plastics and pesticides; promoting development of walkable neighborhoods with affordable, energy-efficient housing; and facing down an international oil company in an ongoing federal lawsuit.\ \In recent years, Maine’s fourth-largest city has made a point of sharing its experience with other municipalities, recognizing that few communities in a mostly rural state can afford to staff a sustainability office. There are a handful in Maine, including Portland, Scarborough and Falmouth.\“Other people like sustainability in concept, but when it comes to spending the money, it’s harder to keep people engaged and committed,” Rosenbach said. She was the sustainability manager at Bates College in Lewiston for eight years before taking the job in South Portland. Before that, she was a waste reduction specialist for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, D.C.\Rosenbach has asked for a budget increase this spring, from $112,080 in fiscal 2019, which ends June 30, to $141,674 for fiscal 2020, largely so her part-time assistant, Lucy Brennan, could work full time for the city.\Mayor Claude Morgan, who heads South Portland’s City Council, said Rosenbach probably will get more than she asked for so Brennan can start working full time in July rather than wait until January 2020.\Morgan said he’s glad Rosenbach’s outreach and the city’s experience in environmental action are benefiting other municipalities.\“While it’s costing us to develop that knowledge, it doesn’t cost us anything to give it away,” Morgan said. “We sort of have a moral obligation to do the right thing and to share it.”\Gray, a town north of Portland with more than 8,000 residents, has benefited from South Portland’s generosity for nearly a year.\“We’ve been talking about going solar for a while, but we didn’t really gain any traction until we visited South Portland’s array last June,” said Carder, the town councilor. “We saw what they’ve done and thought, ‘This could really work for us.’”\ \South Portland has been at the forefront of environmental action for more than a decade, taking steps to address climate change that have involved nearly every city department and touched every resident.\The city’s efforts are based on the premise that scientists say carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases produced by burning fossil fuels and other human activity are contributing to a warming atmosphere, melting ice caps and glaciers, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, changing weather patterns and other conditions related to accelerated climate change. It’s also generally accepted and stated without debate at public meetings that single-use plastics and many synthetic chemicals are bad for the environment and human health.\The City Council has passed a ban on foam food containers, a 5-cent fee on single-use shopping bags and a pesticide ordinance that’s on track to be expanded to include synthetic fertilizers in the coming months.\The city also has leased electric cars and installed public charging stations, added food waste collection to its recycling program, nearly finished converting its streetlights to energy-saving LED fixtures, and completed a multimillion-dollar sewer and storm drain separation project to protect Casco Bay, well ahead of many other communities.\Then there’s the 2,944-panel solar array that South Portland started operating in 2017. Built by ReVision Energy, of Portland, it’s designed to generate 1.2 million kilowatt-hours of energy per year, or roughly 12 percent of the electricity used by the city’s municipal and school buildings.\Portland, Maine’s largest city, with more than 66,000 residents, has since completed a slightly smaller array on its landfill. Under solar contracts negotiated in tandem, each city will purchase electricity from ReVision at higher-than-market rates for the first six years, before being able to buy the solar equipment outright for nearly $1.6 million.\The neighboring cities have collaborated on many environmental initiatives, developed with Troy Moon, Portland’s sustainability chief. Most recently, each city has allocated $110,000 to share a consultant and develop individual community-based plans to deal with climate change effects, including sea-level rise at the edge of Casco Bay.\ \But it’s South Portland’s willingness to take on big-ticket environmental challenges that sets it apart from other Maine cities and towns. In 2014, the City Council passed the so-called Clear Skies ordinance, which banned the bulk loading of crude oil into tankers in Portland Harbor because of potential air quality and health impacts.\The controversial ordinance effectively blocked the Portland Pipe Line Corp. from reversing the flow of its pipeline, which has carried foreign crude from harbor terminals South Portland to Montreal refineries since World War II. The ordinance anticipated the day when demand for foreign crude would dry up and the company might want to use the pipeline to bring Canadian tar sands oil south.\Now the pipeline is largely unused and the company, a Canadian-owned subsidiary of ExxonMobil, Shell and Suncor Energy, is challenging the ordinance in federal court. The city hired a Boston law firm and has so far spent $2.4 million fighting the 2015 lawsuit, including $174,000 donated by residents and others.\The city won the first round in U.S. District Court in Portland last year, when a judge ruled that South Portland had the right to enact the zoning, that it didn’t violate the Constitution and that it acted in keeping with the city’s comprehensive plan. The company filed a notice of intent to appeal the decision in November.\Last month, the city learned that the EPA filed a federal lawsuit and consent decree against Global Partners LP, a Fortune 500 company that operates a fuel storage facility on the banks of the Fore River.\The EPA charged Global with violating the federal Clean Air Act and its emissions license issued by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. Global and Maine DEP officials dispute the EPA’s findings, but the lawsuit has called attention to a variety of pollution, odor, traffic and other community concerns related to more than 100 bulk oil storage tanks and other petroleum facilities in the city.\The city has hired a second set of lawyers to respond to the EPA lawsuit and consent decree. And after hearing unanimous calls for action at two recent public meetings on the issue, the city is developing plans to establish its own air-quality monitoring program.\“The situation with Global has emphasized that we really need to be doing it ourselves because we don’t want surprises,” said Morgan, South Portland’s mayor. “This is happening in our own backyards.”\ \Asked if South Portland’s environmental activism makes it the “greenest” city in Maine, Morgan declined to quantify what he said really cannot be measured.\Morgan noted that the city has been on a path to sustainability since 2007, the last time he was mayor, when the city signed on to the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection agreement, which set a goal to reduce carbon emissions below 1990 levels.\South Portland’s Municipal Climate Action Plan, adopted in 2014, called for city operations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2017, which the city exceeded by 6 percentage points in advance of the deadline.\Now the city is aiming to use 100 percent clean renewable energy for municipal operations by 2040, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent citywide by 2050 through increased efficiency, conservation and renewable energy initiatives.\Another citywide goal is to increase South Portland’s recycling rate from about 29 percent to 40 percent by 2020 through a campaign to encourage purposeful buying, reuse, recycling and composting.\With the statewide municipal coalition, Rosenbach is promoting the following legislative initiatives:\• Revise net metering rules so municipal solar arrays can exceed the current 660-kilowatt size limit and have more than nine off-site meters or users, among other changes.\• Update Maine’s Uniform Building and Energy Code so cities and towns can develop so-called stretch codes, which phase in stricter requirements for energy-efficient construction.\• Improve access to energy-use data from utility companies for municipalities that have adopted so-called benchmarking ordinances, including Portland and South Portland. This would allow them to more easily monitor energy consumption in large buildings and provide incentives for business owners to make energy-efficient renovations.\ \Not everyone likes what South Portland is doing. Online comments on news stories indicate that some people see the city’s fight against the pipeline and its effort to curb petroleum pollution as foolish, anti-business and wasting tax dollars.\Some business owners said they opposed benchmarking because they don’t want to share their energy information or be forced to upgrade their buildings. Some homeowners said they don’t want the city telling them what chemicals they can use in their yards.\Morgan and Rosenbach are convinced by the turnout at public meetings and the feedback they get on the street that the vast majority of residents support the city’s efforts. A local citizens group, Protect South Portland, actively campaigns for various sustainability initiatives and its members have contributed a significant amount of money to fight the pipeline lawsuit.\“(Opposition is) a realistic part of change,” Rosenbach said. “I totally understand people have their own perspectives.

I write to urge my Senator, Garrett Mason, and Representative, Paul Chace, to support LD 1649, the solar energy policy under consideration in Augusta. That bill would create 800 new jobs in Maine's solar industry, help keep young people in Maine, lower electricity rates for Mainers, and grow Maine's economy by supporting Maine solar energy companies.
\
The governor and his legislative allies are working to kill a bill that creates solar jobs, lowers energy costs and moves Maine forward on clean energy. They want to block the bill, or replace it with a do-nothing amendment, in order to hand control of Maine's solar future to the LePage-appointed PUC, which has the inclination to weaken or eliminate net-metering and would jeopardize hundreds of existing solar jobs.
\
Maine is in last place in the region on solar and solar jobs. These attacks threaten hundreds of existing solar jobs, risking Maine falling even further behind.
\
Instead of falling behind, it is time to look forward: Clean energy technology, quality technology jobs and investments in modern energy systems are common sense for Maine's future. Bipartisan lawmakers, utilities, Maine solar companies, the Maine Municipal Association, the Public Advocate, diverse businesses, environmental groups, community leaders and others all support this bill.
\
Lawmakers have a choice: Line up with the governor's anti-solar ideology and risk hundreds of jobs in Maine's already fragile solar industry; or work with a group of stakeholders who don't usually agree and came up with win-win solutions that benefit Maine's economy, environment and energy costs.

376,"AUGUSTA, Maine -- Gov. Paul LePage said Friday he would urge the three-member Maine Public Utilities Commission ""to resign in a heartbeat,"" saying their ""absolutely horrendous"" decision last week on solar policy will hurt most of the state's electricity ratepayers.\The Republican governor called a rare news conference in Augusta to expand on remarks made during Tuesday's State of the State speech, when he said that he'd fire the three utility commissioners -- whom LePage appointed -- though he doesn't have the power to remove them.\It's all around the commission's decision last week that rolled back ""net metering"" -- a policy in effect since the 1980s in Maine that allows homeowners with solar panels to be credited by utilities, including Central Maine Power, for excess power sent to the grid.\LePage has called for the policy's elimination, labeling it an unfair subsidy. For opposite reasons. he and environmentalists who support it were angered by the decision, which will allow existing customers and those signing up before 2018 to be grandfathered at current rates for 15 years, but give reduced credits to those who enter the program through 2042.\On Friday, he said of the commission that he ""would ask them to resign in a heartbeat,"" saying his only demand is to ""lower the cost"" of energy and ""do no harm to the environment.""\""The people who generate the solar power on their roof pay for the generation but CMP is still going to bill you,"" LePage said. ""The Maine people are going to pay for transmission costs twice until 2042."""
377,"Utilities must prepare for the grid of the future.\ROCKPORT -- The utilities of the future will look very different from those of the past. Central Maine Power Co. must stop looking in the rearview mirror, and instead use the current rate case as an opportunity to implement electric grid reforms that enable a cleaner and lower-cost energy future. \ENE (Environment Northeast) recently released EnergyVision, which shows that the New England states could reduce oil consumption and carbon emissions dramatically by switching from gasoline-powered vehicles to cleaner electric vehicles and oil-heated buildings to efficient heat pumps. According to EnergyVision, greater efficiency will deliver $19.5 billion in economic benefits and 51.3 million metric tons of avoided greenhouse gas emissions in the Northeast alone. \ENE intervened in the CMP rate case to advance policies and rates that will help to create the grid of the future. Consumers should be allowed and encouraged to take advantage of an array of new energy options. \CMP's proposal to divorce its earnings from the number of kilowatt-hours it sells, as almost every other utility in New England has already done, is overdue and welcome. Right now, the company has a financial incentive to promote electricity usage, which results in higher power bills and greater combustion of fossil fuels. The proposed revenue ""decoupling"" will align CMP's incentives with those of its customers, and make them partners in efforts to save. \CMP's proposed increase in customer charges from $5 to $20 per month over the next four years, however, will not serve customers well. This $20 charge could not be avoided by investing in clean energy or energy efficiency, thus reducing a customer's incentive to make these choices. \At the same time, CMP proposes to recover less of its costs through the price of each kilowatt-hour a customer uses, so high-usage customers will pay less than they do today, while low-usage customers will pay more. CMP's proposed changes penalize those who invest in smart measures to save, like more energy-efficient lights, appliances and equipment - and shut them off when not in use. \CMP's proposal would limit consumer options. Increasingly, consumers and communities can choose to invest in small-scale wind and solar ""distributed"" generation at our homes and businesses. Lowering the per-kilowatt-hour charge and increasing the fixed customer charge would reduce the financial attractiveness of installing these systems. \Not only do distributed generation customers lower their own energy bills by receiving credit for every kilowatt-hour they generate, they also can help to reduce the energy bills of other customers. \Collectively, these systems help to reduce the need for expensive new power lines and the purchase of expensive power from fossil plants during peak hours, thereby reducing the costs of and emissions produced by the system. \CMP's midcoast pilot project is proving that energy efficiency, energy storage and local power generation like solar photovoltaics can relieve stress on the grid during the ""peak"" hours, and at a much lower cost than building expensive new power lines. If Maine is to achieve its climate and energy goals, we must create a renewable-ready energy delivery system that is friendly to small, on-site renewable power generation. \Utility rates should be designed to advance a cleaner energy future that will free consumers to take advantage of new technologies, and help us end our dependence on imported oil and our growing dependence on natural gas. Rates should: \n Facilitate investments in technologies that help control costs by better utilizing the grid. \n Increase the value and deployment of clean distributed generation and energy technologies in order to reduce infrastructure costs. \n Support and promote high-efficiency electric heating technology, electric vehicles and other resources in a manner that increases grid stability. \n Drive deep and persistent energy savings, both in kilowatts and kilowatt-hours. \n Complement and support net metering policies. \n Consider bill impacts, affordability, low incomes, consumer choice and synergies such as the provision of backup service to the grid by electric vehicles. \All of these measures will support a shift to clean, reliable fuels and facilitate customer control and cost savings. \Preparing the 21st-century power grid for large-scale adoption of electric vehicles, air source heat pumps, clean distributed generation, renewable generation and high-efficiency equipment is critical. We must get CMP's rates right to advance this cleaner energy future. \-- Special to the Press Herald"
378,"
As if it weren't bad enough to hear that the Madison Paper Industries plant would shut down in May, putting 214 Maine residents out of work, Gov. Paul LePage made it worse: Five years into the job, the state's chief executive showed again that he doesn't understand the state's economic problems and has no plan to deal with them.
\
In a statement issued by his office on March 14, LePage acknowledged the plummeting demand for the supercalendered paper produced in Madison, which is the company's stated reason for shutting down its operation. Then, he rolled out his standard medicine for every illness: lower taxes for ""job creators,"" reduced energy costs and ""providing a welcoming atmosphere for businesses and capital investment.""
\
It was a stunning display of cluelessness. Could the governor really think that cutting or even eliminating income taxes for high wage earners would have had any effect on decision-makers in a multinational corporation who may never set foot in Maine, let alone file a tax return here? Could he really believe that Maine, with no coal, oil or gas reserves, could ever lower its electric rates to compete with places where those resources exist?
\
And by a ""welcoming atmosphere for business and capital investment,"" is he referring to the way he has stiff-armed attempts to grow the state's clean-energy sector, closing the door on investment and local jobs that can't be sent overseas?
\
If the governor understood how to help ""job creators,"" he wouldn't be trying to kill a new solar energy policy that is under debate in the Legislature. The plan is projected to create 800 new jobs over the next five years through incentives to boost solar power capacity in the state by a factor of 12. Even aside from the environmental benefits of solar energy, that's a good deal for Maine.
\
The governor may not see it that way because this does not look like a traditional economic development opportunity. The investors are not Wall Street speculators but home and business owners who want to cut their energy costs. The ""job creators"" are not wealthy CEOs from other states but local contractors who would hire help to meet the demand for solar installations.
\
There may not be a groundbreaking ceremony outside a new factory, but instead there would be steady growth of small businesses all over the state, which would start right away.
\
And that is the kind of job growth that Maine desperately needs. Rather than wait for the next paper industry to decide to move here, Maine should be helping businesses get started and grow. Expanding solar power is one way to do that.
\
The solar bill is the result of a six-month collaboration among utilities, solar installers, environmental groups and the state's public advocate, who represents ratepayers at the Public Utilities Commission. If passed, it would create a mechanism for owners of solar panels to sell the excess power they generate when the sun is shining, giving them a credit to offset their bills for what they use when the sun is down.
\
About half of the new solar installations would be on houses and small businesses. The rest would be distributed among group solar farms, jointly owned by people who can't install solar panels on their own property; installations on shopping malls, factories and other large buildings; and grid-scale arrays strategically placed around the state that would put power into the system where it is most needed during peak-demand summer months, making the grid more reliable for everyone.
\
But when the Legislature heard the bill last week, LePage threw a monkey wrench into the works through his Republican allies. Rep. Nathan Wadsworth, R-Hiram, who had participated in the stakeholder group, said lawmakers should not address the issue at all, kicking it over to the Public Utilities Commission, which is made up of LePage appointees.
\
If the PUC gets to decide the matter, it could not only kill the expansion proposal but end the existing incentive program known as net-metering, risking the 330 jobs in the solar panel installation business that exist now as well as the 800 potential new jobs.
\
Lawmakers from both parties should not let LePage lead them into this terrible mistake.
\
The millworkers in Madison don't need lower income tax rates or cheaper electricity. They need jobs.
\
Maine won't get them by begging private equity investors and multinational corporations to come here and save us.
\
The state should commit to creating an environment where the industries of the future can grow, and a commitment to do that should have been the governor's response to the bad news from Madison.

Manchester was briefly seated as senator after 21 ballots from Long Island were discovered, but Breen was confirmed as the winner after a recount. \In her term as a senator, Breen said she fought to release Land for Maine's Future bond funds for conservation projects in the district and pushed a bill to expand tax breaks for Maine graduates to pay off student debt. \""I've tried really hard to focus on what matters for the district, which is education, the environment and taxes. Hopefully they will send me back,"" Breen said. \She is preparing a bill to revive the circuit-breaker program, a property tax rebate policy for seniors that was replaced with an income tax break in 2013. The new policy isn't as much help for seniors who want to stay in their homes, she said. Rising property taxes are an issue, but Breen doesn't think adding a local sales tax will work. Previous attempts to add local option sales taxes have been fiercely opposed by businesses, Breen added. \Breen supports referendums to require background checks for private gun sales and to raise the minimum wage, but not to legalize recreational marijuana. She is opposed to Gov. Paul LePage's proposal to reduce and eventually eliminate the state's income tax and believes the state is not doing enough to respond to the opiate abuse crisis. \Breen votes with her party, but denied she is too partisan. ""I live in a district of mixed enrollment. I have been endorsed by a variety of parties, and I work across the aisle all the time,"" Breen said. \Ladd, a Delta Airlines captain, was in the Georgia General Assembly from 1991-1999 and a state senator from 1999-2003. In 2011, he moved to Falmouth because he was attracted to its good schools, he said. \If elected he would be more independent than Breen and break with his party on issues that matter to the district, Ladd added. \""I would be not as partisan; I have a record of working across the aisle,"" he said. \Ladd said he wants to address the ""demographic death spiral"" affecting the state by attracting and retaining new residents and entrepreneurs. Specifically, Ladd said he wants to address Maine's property tax burden by introducing local sales taxes and raising more revenue from visitors and part-time residents. \Ladd said he wants to change the rules to abolish joint House-Senate committees because it ""robs the state Senate of its independence and its proper role in checks and balances."" \To address climate change Ladd said he would push for the state to drop daylight saving time to save energy and reduce emissions. He is also a supporter of the state's solar industry and agrees with a system of credits that power companies reimburse to household solar producers known as net metering. \Ladd said he supports eventually eliminating the income tax and opposes background checks for private gun sales and legalized marijuana. He said the state's opiate crisis was ""so sad"" and would like to do more, but wouldn't have specific budgetary information until he was elected. \Both Breen and Ladd are publicly funded through the Maine Clean Election Act, which limits private contributions and provides supplemental funds for Senate candidates. Breen had raised $35,000 through Sept. 20, according to her most recent filing. Ladd filed more recently, and had raised $28,375 through Oct. 25.

380,"It should have been a story about how government and industry came together to quietly solve a problem through compromise. Instead, it became another example of dysfunction eminating from the office of Maine's chief executive.\When Gov. Paul LePage last week inserted himself, without cause or caution, into the debate over adding so-called ""nips"" to Maine's bottle deposit law, it was the last six years distilled down to a 50-milliliter shot, with the governor's petty gripes and shallow prejudices once again stirring the drink.\At issue is L.D. 56, which would place a 5-cent deposit on the smallest liquor bottles sold in Maine. Sales of nips have skyrocketed in recent years -- largely due to the popularity of Fireball, a cinnamon-flavored liquor produced in Lewiston -- and the discarded tiny bottles are now making up a significant portion of roadside trash.\The simple solution was adding the 50-milliliter bottles to the state's enormously successful ""bottle bill,"" which in 2010 returned for deposit 90 percent of the 750 million redeemable cans and bottles sold in Maine, clearing the roadways of an untold amount of litter.\Adding to bottles a state-specific deposit is not easy nor cheap, though, so industry leaders were brought into the discussion with legislators. In the end, the deposit was reduced from 15 cents to 5 and the starting date was delayed until 2019. Everyone, it seemed, was happy.\But after the bill passed initial votes in the House, 111-34, and the Senate, 32-3, LePage chimed in. If it ultimately passed, the governor said, he would have no choice but to ban the sales of 50-milliliter bottles in Maine.\Why? Well, LePage said, the bill was the result of a ""secret backroom deal"" made by dishonest legislators, nevermind that lawmakers from both parties worked appropriately with distillers and distributors to find common ground, the best outcome in any legislative endeavor.\Stretching further, LePage said the alleged high cost of the bill would jeopardizes other programs -- you know, those government programs the governor is oh-so-fond of -- nevermind that members of the relevant committee foresaw no such funding problems.\Finally, he said the bill was ""anti-business,"" nevermind that the chief executive of the Lewiston company that produces Fireball, which makes up more than 40 percent of nip sales, said the real danger was not the bill, but LePage's threat to ban sales.\The governor found a better argument later, when during a radio appearance he said selling nips promotes drunken driving, a reasonable point of view he failed to mention in his extensive public statement. \That's a separate issue, however -- this bill is simply aimed at reducing litter, and like the bottle bill before it, there's little doubt that it would.\Remarkably, that might be why Le-Page dislikes this bill so much -- he sees it as prioritizing the environment over industry, when the legislative compromise shows that both sides can be satisfied.\With LePage, though, arguments -- whether reasonable or uncoupled from reality -- are just cover for his animus to, well, just about anyone who contradicts his world view or questions his narrow perception of what Maine should be. \Take for instance solar power, for which the governor last year also negated a hard-fought bipartisan compromise aimed at fixing the thorny issue of net metering. LePage says he doesn't want to pick winners and losers in the energy market, but fails to apply the same philosophy when bailing out the biomass industry, or stumping for more natural gas pipelines.\But it's not philosophy that matters, only that solar, as the governor sees it, is the domain of liberals and coastal elites -- not ""real Mainers."" It's not a new opportunity to capitalize on, but a threat to traditional Maine industries. Nevermind that nationwide, more people work in solar than in coal, natural gas and oil power plants combined.\And that's only the start.\Land conservation? More hippie nonsense aimed at killing jobs, backed by corrupt legislators and rich, liberal landowners looking to make a quick buck. Nevermind that state conservation has saved lands of all kinds and purposes in all 16 counties, and drives our tourism economy.\Methadone and naloxone? Spa day for weak-willed addicts, backed by namby-pamby coddlers, nevermind the drugs' proven effectiveness.\Senior housing? Corrupt legislators again, this time in concert with shady developers. \A new mental health facility? Only on his terms, because lawmakers from both parties only care about making headlines.\That's Paul LePage as he sees himself -- the only honest man in politics, surrounded by liars, schemers and layabouts. The only one with pure intentions, and with a real handle on the problems facing Maine. No one but him with good intentions. No one but him with the right answers.\That truly seems like a terrible world. We're glad we don't live in it.\Credit: "
381,"Governor: Lawmaker 'corrupt' for taking payments for work\Gov. Paul LePage called on Rep. Ryan Tipping, D-Orono, to resign Tuesday, saying the House chairman of the Legislature's Taxation Committee is corrupt for having taken $9,000 in payments for working on a ballot campaign to add a 3 percent surcharge on the state income tax for individuals earning over $200,000 a year.\Tipping responded with a statement calling the criticism a baseless attack and saying he had cleared his work on behalf of the ballot campaign with the state ethics commission. \Jonathan Wayne, the commission's executive director, confirmed that Tipping had sought the agency's advice and was told that he could accept the work without violating conflict-of-interest laws.\LePage's current two-year budget proposal aims to undo the surcharge, which voters approved last November. \The measure is meant to increase funding for Maine public schools.\""That's the kind of corruption I've been after for years and years and years,"" the Republican governor said.

382,"As if it weren't bad enough to hear that the Madison Paper Industries plant would shut down in May, putting 214 people out of work, Gov. LePage made it worse: Five years into the job, Maine's chief executive showed again that he doesn't understand the state's economic problems and has no plan to deal with them. \In a statement issued by his office on March 14, LePage acknowledged the plummeting demand for the supercalendered paper produced in Madison, which is the company's stated reason for shutting down its operation. Then, he rolled out his standard medicine for every illness: lower taxes for ""job creators,"" reduced energy costs and ""providing a welcoming atmosphere for businesses and capital investment."" \It was a stunning display of cluelessness. Could the governor really think that cutting or even eliminating income taxes for high-wage earners would have had any effect on decision-makers in a multinational corporation who may never set foot in Maine, let alone file a tax return here? Could he really believe that Maine, with no coal, oil or gas reserves, could ever lower its electric rates to compete with places where those resources exist? \And by a ""welcoming atmosphere for business and capital investment"" is he referring to the way he has stiff-armed attempts to grow the state's clean- energy sector, closing the door on investment and local jobs that can't be sent overseas? \If the governor understood how to help ""job creators,"" he wouldn't be trying to kill a new solar energy policy that is under debate in the Legislature. \The plan is projected to create 800 new jobs over the next five years through incentives to boost solar power capacity in the state by a factor of 12. Even aside from the environmental benefits of solar energy, that's a good deal for Maine. \NEW MODEL \The governor may not see it that way because this does not look like a traditional economic development opportunity. The investors are not Wall Street speculators but home and business owners who want to cut their energy costs. The ""job creators"" are not wealthy CEOs from other states but local contractors who would hire help to meet demand for solar installations. \There may not be a groundbreaking ceremony outside a new factory, but instead there would be steady growth of small businesses all over the state, which would start right away. \And that is the kind of job growth that Maine desperately needs. Rather than wait for the next paper industry to decide to move here, Maine should be helping businesses get started and grow. Expanding solar power is one way to do that. \The solar bill is the result of a six-month collaboration between utilities, solar installers, environmental groups and the state's public advocate, who represents ratepayers at the Public Utilities Commission. \If passed, it would create a mechanism for owners of solar panels to sell the excess power they generate when the sun is shining, giving them a credit to offset their bills for what they use when the sun is down. \About half of the new solar installations would be on houses and small businesses. The rest would be distributed between group solar farms, jointly owned by people who can't install solar panels on their own property; installations on shopping malls, factories and other large buildings; and grid-scale arrays strategically placed around the state that would put power into the system where it is most needed during peak-demand summer months, making the grid more reliable for everyone. \MONKEY WRENCH \But when the Legislature heard the bill last week, LePage threw a monkey wrench into the works through his Republican allies. \Rep. Nathan Wadsworth, R-Hiram, who had participated in the stakeholder group, said lawmakers should not address the issue at all, kicking it over to the Public Utilities Commission, which is made up of LePage appointees. \If the PUC gets to decide the matter, it could not only kill the expansion proposal but end the existing incentive program known as net-metering, risking the 330 jobs in the solar panel installation business that exist now as well as the 800 potential new jobs. \Lawmakers from both parties should not let LePage lead them into this terrible mistake. \The mill workers in Madison don't need lower income tax rates or cheaper electricity. They need jobs. \Maine won't get them by begging private equity investors and multinational corporations to come here and save us. \The state should commit to creating an environment where the industries of the future can grow, and a commitment to do that should have been the governor's response to the bad news from Madison."

385,"kj.councilmethane.0302: Late. Coverage of Augusta City Council meeting, likely focusing on vote to spend $3 million to build generation system to use methane gas produced by rotting garabage at Hatch Hill landfill to make electricity that'd be fed into grid and give city lower electricity bills. Don't expect much controversy - though I think one neighbor has concerns, but would be a fairly unique thing for such a relatively small landfill operation. If that falls flat, other options would be vote on council goals for the year or vote on new contracts for a couple of employee unions.\Augusta council votes unanimously in favor of $3 million proposal for Hatch Hill landfill\AUGUSTA -- City councilors on Thursday evening approved spending $3 million to build a system to use methane gas generated by decomposing garbage at Hatch Hill landfill to produce electricity and reduce the city's electric bills.\Councilors voted unanimously for the project, which Public Works Director Lesley Jones said is unique for such a small landfill and will have environmental benefits, including an improvement in air quality and reduction in odors coming from the landfill.\""It's a huge project on the environmental side,"" Jones told city councilors.\While councilors previously had expressed support for the idea and agreed to fund projects related to it, Thursday's vote was the first to authorize funding for construction of the power-generating site at the landfill, which is used by residents of several municipalities in the area.\The $3 million project would be financed by money generated at Hatch Hill.\Ralph St. Pierre, finance director and assistant city manager, said the project will pay for itself in 11 years with the savings it is expected to generate.\While the landfill is projected to be full, and possibly close, in about 15 years, it is expected to keep producing gas for at least 17 years, so the proposed new power-generating facility that would be built at Hatch Hill could result in the city saving money on its electricity bills once the cost of the project is recovered.\Hatch Hill already has a system that collects methane gas at the landfill to prevent it from escaping into and harming the environment. It is burned off by a flare, though Jones said not all gas is captured by the system, so some vents into the air.\Jones said, in response to questions from At-large Councilor Corey Wilson, the project could help reduce odors coming from the landfill.\Wilson said he drove by the landfill Thursday and it smelled awful.\Jones said that when the project is complete, it will draw more methane into the system, some of which might otherwise escape from the landfill. She said the additional wells to help capture more methane already are being built. She also said a future project will include putting a plastic cap over the landfill.\""We'll be drawing more gas, and the next step after that is to put a cap on,"" Jones said. ""Then the gas wells will be more effective. I think that will help a lot.""\The proposed new system would use the gas generated at the landfill to produce electricity, for which the city would be compensated by Central Maine Power Co. with a credit toward electricity used at city facilities. The city plans to use that credit to offset the electric bills for the nine city buildings that use the most electricity. Those are City Center, Augusta Civic Center, Cony High School, Capital Area Technical Center, two of the city's four elementary schools, the police station, Lithgow Public Library and Buker Community Center.\St. Pierre said the project is expected to pay for itself in 11 years and generate savings for the city whether controversial proposed new state ""net metering"" rules recommended by the state Public Utilities Commission are put in place or not.\The Pine Tree Landfill, in Hampden, owned by Casella Waste Systems, installed a system to convert trash to energy in 2008.\Officials of Woodard & Curran, an engineering firm working on the project for the city, said in a memo to the city that the project, including electrical generation equipment, a new, 1,400 square-foot building to house the equipment and other operations, and the extension of a gas line from the landfill collection system to the generators, could go out to bid in March and be operational by December.\The cost of the project, initially expected to be about $2 million, now is expected to be about $3 million. The size of the generation system also has increased since the idea first was hatched, from a 350-kilowatt generation system to a 550-kilowatt system. And revenue from the project is also higher than was estimated previously, in 2016, by about 40 percent -- in part because the city now proposes to collect methane gas from a newer section of the landfill, where a new methane collection system would be installed.\St. Pierre said the facility will generate about 4.2 million kilowatt hours of electricity, which he said would be enough to power about 600 homes, if it were used for that purpose.\The state Department of Environmental Protection approved an air quality license for the project in February. The Augusta Planning Board held a public hearing and approved the project Feb. 13, with a condition of approval requiring noise levels to be checked quarterly to make sure noise from the generators does not exceed the limits of the city's noise ordinance.\Credit: By KEITH EDWARDS Staff Writer"

Well, LePage said, the bill was the result of a ""secret backroom deal"" made by dishonest legislators, never mind that lawmakers from both parties worked appropriately with distillers and distributors to find common ground, the best outcome in any legislative endeavor. \Stretching further, LePage said the alleged high cost of the bill would jeopardize other programs - you know, those government programs the governor is oh, so fond of - never mind that members of the relevant committee foresaw no such funding problems. \Finally, he said the bill was ""anti-business,"" never mind that the chief executive of the Lewiston company that produces Fireball, which makes up more than 40 percent of nip sales, said the real danger was not the bill, but LePage's threat to ban sales. \The governor found a better argument later, when, during a radio appearance, he said that selling nips promotes drunken driving, a reasonable point of view he failed to mention in his extensive public statement. \But that's a separate issue - this bill is simply aimed at reducing litter, and like the bottle bill before it, there's little doubt that it would. Remarkably, that might be why LePage dislikes this bill so much - he sees it as prioritizing the environment over industry, when the legislative compromise shows that both sides can be satisfied. \ARGUMENTS JUST A COVER \With LePage, though, arguments - whether reasonable or uncoupled from reality - are just cover for his anitipathy toward, well, just about anyone who contradicts his world view or questions his narrow perception of what Maine should be. \Take, for instance, solar power, for which the governor last year also negated a hard-fought bipartisan compromise aimed at fixing the thorny issue of net metering. LePage says he doesn't want to pick winners and losers in the energy market, but fails to apply the same philosophy when bailing out the biomass industry, or stumping for more natural gas pipelines. \But it's not philosophy that matters, only that solar, as the governor sees it, is the domain of liberals and coastal elites - not ""real Mainers."" It's not a new opportunity to capitalize on, but a threat to traditional Maine industries. Never mind that nationwide, more people work in solar than in coal, natural gas and oil power plants combined. \And that's only the start. \Land conservation? More hippie nonsense aimed at killing jobs, backed by corrupt legislators and rich, liberal landowners looking to make a quick buck. Never mind that state conservation has saved properties of all kinds and purposes in all 16 counties, and drives our tourism economy. \Methadone and naloxone? Spa day for weak-willed addicts, backed by namby-pamby coddlers, never mind the drugs' proven effectiveness. \Senior housing? Corrupt legislators again, this time in concert with shady developers. \A new mental health facility? Only on his terms, because lawmakers from both parties care only about making headlines. \That's Paul LePage as he sees himself - the only honest man in politics, surrounded by liars, schemers and layabouts. The only one with pure intentions, and with a real handle on the problems facing Maine. No one but him with good intentions. No one but him with the right answers. \That truly seems like a terrible world. We're glad we don't live in it."
387,"kj.councilmethane.0302: Late. Coverage of Augusta City Council meeting, likely focusing on vote to spend $3 million to build generation system to use methane gas produced by rotting garabage at Hatch Hill landfill to make electricity that'd be fed into grid and give city lower electricity bills. Don't expect much controversy - though I think one neighbor has concerns, but would be a fairly unique thing for such a relatively small landfill operation. If that falls flat, other options would be vote on council goals for the year or vote on new contracts for a couple of employee unions.\AUGUSTA -- City councilors on Thursday evening approved spending $3 million to build a system to use methane gas generated by decomposing garbage at Hatch Hill landfill to produce electricity and reduce the city's electric bills.\Councilors voted unanimously for the project, which Public Works Director Lesley Jones said is unique for such a small landfill and will have environmental benefits, including an improvement in air quality and reduction in odors coming from the landfill.\""It's a huge project on the environmental side,"" Jones told city councilors.\While councilors previously had expressed support for the idea and agreed to fund projects related to it, Thursday's vote was the first to authorize funding for construction of the power-generating site at the landfill, which is used by residents of several municipalities in the area.\The $3 million project would be financed by money generated at Hatch Hill.\Ralph St. Pierre, finance director and assistant city manager, said the project will pay for itself in 11 years with the savings it is expected to generate.\While the landfill is projected to be full, and possibly close, in about 15 years, it is expected to keep producing gas for at least 17 years, so the proposed new power-generating facility that would be built at Hatch Hill could result in the city saving money on its electricity bills once the cost of the project is recovered.\Hatch Hill already has a system that collects methane gas at the landfill to prevent it from escaping into and harming the environment. It is burned off by a flare, though Jones said not all gas is captured by the system, so some vents into the air.\Jones said, in response to questions from At-large Councilor Corey Wilson, the project could help reduce odors coming from the landfill.\Wilson said he drove by the landfill Thursday and it smelled awful.\Jones said that when the project is complete, it will draw more methane into the system, some of which might otherwise escape from the landfill. She said the additional wells to help capture more methane already are being built. She also said a future project will include putting a plastic cap over the landfill.\""We'll be drawing more gas, and the next step after that is to put a cap on,"" Jones said. ""Then the gas wells will be more effective. I think that will help a lot.""\The proposed new system would use the gas generated at the landfill to produce electricity, for which the city would be compensated by Central Maine Power Co. with a credit toward electricity used at city facilities. The city plans to use that credit to offset the electric bills for the nine city buildings that use the most electricity. Those are City Center, Augusta Civic Center, Cony High School, Capital Area Technical Center, two of the city's four elementary schools, the police station, Lithgow Public Library and Buker Community Center.\St. Pierre said the project is expected to pay for itself in 11 years and generate savings for the city whether controversial proposed new state ""net metering"" rules recommended by the state Public Utilities Commission are put in place or not.\The Pine Tree Landfill, in Hampden, owned by Casella Waste Systems, installed a system to convert trash to energy in 2008.\Officials of Woodard & Curran, an engineering firm working on the project for the city, said in a memo to the city that the project, including electrical generation equipment, a new, 1,400 square-foot building to house the equipment and other operations, and the extension of a gas line from the landfill collection system to the generators, could go out to bid in March and be operational by December.\The cost of the project, initially expected to be about $2 million, now is expected to be about $3 million. The size of the generation system also has increased since the idea first was hatched, from a 350-kilowatt generation system to a 550-kilowatt system. And revenue from the project is also higher than was estimated previously, in 2016, by about 40 percent -- in part because the city now proposes to collect methane gas from a newer section of the landfill, where a new methane collection system would be installed.\St. Pierre said the facility will generate about 4.2 million kilowatt hours of electricity, which he said would be enough to power about 600 homes, if it were used for that purpose.\The state Department of Environmental Protection approved an air quality license for the project in February. The Augusta Planning Board held a public hearing and approved the project Feb. 13, with a condition of approval requiring noise levels to be checked quarterly to make sure noise from the generators does not exceed the limits of the city's noise ordinance.\Credit: By KEITH EDWARDS Staff Writer"
388,"In 2013, over 13 million Americans had their identity stolen and, according to the Federal Trade Commission, identity theft steadily climbs and tops their list of consumer complaints each year. With this level of identity theft, why wouldn't we be concerned about voter fraud? \Once our identity is stolen, the information is used to access money, benefits, medical or government services. It's also being used in imposter scams and to hide one's own identity when stopped by police. \Why do we think that those who engage in identity theft will use it for everything except voter fraud? I'm thinking some of us have more faith in criminals than is warranted. \When I asked my state representative, Ryan Fecteau, D-Biddeford, where he stood on this issue, he said he doesn't believe there is any voter fraud that would warrant a voter ID law. He's touting the stale line of disenfranchising the elderly and poor. \He offered links to a couple of documents that he said led him to this conclusion. I read them and am amazed at the commentary in these old articles that was presented as facts on which to base his conclusion.  \One article stated that voting is a constitutional right. Yes, but only for American citizens. We have an illegal immigration problem, right? \Can Mr. Fecteau think for himself? Over 70 percent of Americans think that showing a legitimate ID before voting is a good idea. So when will our elected officials start listening to the people who elected them? \Debi Davis Biddeford \Another step to freedom advances at castle courtyard \It is most fitting that thousands of Irish people would gather last Saturday in the courtyard of Dublin Castle to celebrate the overwhelming approval of the marriage equality referendum (""Ireland votes to legalize gay marriage,"" Portland Press Herald, May 23). \Here it was in 1922 that seven centuries of British rule ended when Lord Lieutenant Edmund FitzAlan ceremoniously handed over the castle to the victorious commander-in-chief, Michael Collins, after the birth of the Irish Free State, which gave ""us freedom, not the ultimate freedom that all nations desire ... but the freedom to achieve it."" \The ancient walls reverberated again last Saturday as thousands of men and women shouted out their joy to advance another step to freedom: the freedom to love and marry the partner of their choice. \Robert F. Lyons Kennebunkport \Ireland's overwhelming vote in favor of marriage equality brings to mind this passage from the Cyclops episode of ""Ulysses"": \""But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life ... Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred."" \Well said, James Joyce - and well done, Ireland. \Ellen Deirdre Murphy Portland \It's possible to legislate against cellphone stupidity \I was shocked and appalled to read that the Maine House of Representatives has again rejected a bill to prohibit the use of hand-held cellphones while driving. \How many more innocent people have to die at the hands of these mobile phone booth morons before the House takes sensible action? \By voting against this bill after having been shown studies that suggest talking on a hand-held cellphone is the same as driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.08, the House would seem to indicate that it is condoning drunken driving. \While Rep. Richard Pickett, R-Dixfield, does not think it's possible to legislate common sense, it is possible to legislate against stupidity - evidently something we Mainers need to do at the polls. \Robert Glover Portland \By invoking nuclear genie, what is LePage thinking? \How interesting that Summit Natural Gas of Maine has asked the LePage-appointed public utilities commissioners for permission to pass on millions of dollars of advertising expenses to ratepayers (""Summit: Let customers pay for gas 'education,' "" Page A1, May 14). \Make big promises, and then pass the expenses on to the public when things don't quite work out. \Remember when the nuclear industry told us about electricity that was going to be ""too cheap to meter""? The general public is still on the hook for their waste stream. \Yet our governor wants to repeal Maine's law that requires a public referendum on new nuclear power plants. How about a Fukushima-sized reactor in your backyard? \Not content with invoking the nuclear genie, LePage also seems bent on killing off Maine's growing solar energy movement by revoking the current net metering law. \This is a technology that allows the harvest of clean, free energy from the sun and creates hundreds of jobs for skilled workers. Go figure. \Thomas Kircher Biddeford \Clean water loopholes may destroy state's treasures \I just moved to Portland three weeks ago and already see why people love it. \Walking around the Old Port, I see the ships and docks, a vestige of the old shipyard, but also a new vibrant energy that comes from the numerous restaurants and bars. \Talking to some of the natives, I learn everyone seems to have a great fishing tale, or a camp in the northern part of the state, where cherished memories were created with loved ones on a boat or swimming in their local pond. \Yet I can't help but to be afraid that I won't be able to experience similar things in the future because of the loopholes in the Clean Water Act. Right now, 25,000 miles of this state's streams are open to pollution. \The bodies of water that made me want to move up here from New York City - like Sebago Lake - are threatened. The cultural treasures of Maine, along with our drinking water, are at risk. \The Environmental Protection Agency proposed the clean water rule Wednesday, giving Sen. Angus King a choice: to protect what makes Maine special, or cede to special interests. \To me, it seems like a no brainer.

389,"Governor calls lawmaker 'corrupt' for taking payments for work on campaign\Gov. Paul LePage called on Rep. Ryan Tipping, D-Orono, to resign Tuesday, saying the House chairman of the Legislature's Taxation Committee is corrupt for having taken $9,000 in payments for working on a ballot campaign to add a 3 percent surcharge on the state income tax for individuals earning over $200,000 a year.\Tipping responded with a statement calling the criticism a baseless attack and saying he had cleared his work on behalf of the ballot campaign with the state ethics commission. \Jonathan Wayne, the commission's executive director, confirmed that Tipping had sought the agency's advice and was told that he could accept the work without violating conflict-of-interest laws.\LePage's current two-year budget proposal aims to undo the surcharge, which voters approved last November. The measure is meant to increase funding for Maine public schools.\""That's the kind of corruption I've been after for years and years and years,"" the Republican governor said. ""Some people say it's not corruption, it's just business as usual; but I call that the utmost corruption. You are turning your back on the constituents you are supposed to serve."" \LePage, speaking during his weekly appearance on the Bangor-based WVOM George Hale and Ric Tyler talk radio show, was reacting to a news release from the Maine Republican Party that called for Tipping to recuse himself from voting on any legislation that would change the new tax law approved by voters.\According to campaign finance reports filed with Maine's ethics commission, Tipping was paid by the political action committee Citizens Who Support Maine Schools for campaign consulting and ""other professional services."" \The PAC was formed to support ballot Question 2 in 2016, and was funded largely by the Maine Education Association PAC, a political action committee for the statewide teachers union, the Maine Education Association. \Maine Republican Party Chairman Demi Kouzounas asked House Democrats to reassign Tipping to a different committee in a statement issued early Tuesday.\""We request swift action from House Democrats to remedy this situation, and restore confidence in the Taxation Committee as they undertake work that will impact every person in the state of Maine,"" Kouzounas said in the statement. ""If this slipped unknown under the radar, it is an unfortunate mistake; but if it was known before Rep. Tipping was assigned his committee, I harbor grave concerns about the judgment of Democratic leadership."" \In her release, Kouzounas also pointed out that Tipping accepted the payments from the PAC while he was running as a publicly financed candidate for the Maine House under the state's Clean Elections laws.\Tipping said in his statement that he was employed by the Stand Up for Students Campaign from May to November 2016. \""I took a job fighting for a cause I've believed in for a long time, after getting permission from the Maine Ethics Commission,"" Tipping said in the written statement. ""I'm not going to apologize for that. This is a baseless attack meant to distract from the fact that (Republicans are) desperate to repeal the referendum question that would finally fund our schools at the appropriate level."" \He said as chairman of the taxation committee, he would work with colleagues from both parties to build a fair tax structure. ""That does not include ignoring voters who have twice told us to stop raising property taxes to cover the state's share of education costs.""\A spokeswoman for Tipping said as an employee of the Stand Up for Students Campaign, he worked as an outreach coordinator speaking to school boards, city councils and others about the ballot question.\Wayne, the director of the ethics commission, said the situation was not unheard of for members of the citizen Legislature.\""Legislators have campaign and political skills and are occasionally offered paid employment from political groups, such as party committees or PACs. Both Maine Clean Election Act and traditionally financed candidates may accept these offers of employment,"" Wayne said in an email.\""Rep. (Tipping) asked the commission staff for informal advice in May 2016 before beginning the work. We advised that he could accept the employment within the conflict of interest standards in the Legislative Ethics Law ... provided that the PAC did not offer the work to him for the purpose of influencing him in the performance of his duties as a Legislator,"" Wayne said.\Wayne said the law gives legislators discretion about whether to recuse themselves based on current or past employment. However, he said, ""based on the factual information available to me (including the Republican Party's news release), it seems unlikely that the Representative's past work for the PAC would require him to recuse himself from legislation relating to taxation or education funding. ... The issue of assignment as a committee chair is within the discretion of legislative leadership. The Legislative Ethics Law does not offer any guidance on this question.""\Also during his radio interview Tuesday, LePage again took aim at the Maine Public Utilities Commission and called on all three commissioners to step aside. \Though LePage appointed all three, he said he failed by putting the wrong people on the commission and lamented the commission's recent ruling on solar net metering.\""They have failed their jobs. I have failed by not putting the right people in there,"" LePage said. ""And yes, I wished they would all resign. They failed. Their responsibility was to lower the cost of energy, lower the cost of people's electricity, but do no harm to the environment. That was a simple little process and they failed.""\Credit: By SCOTT THISTLE Portland Press Herald"

ARUNDEL -- On the lawn behind the Solar Market offices here, 144 solar-electric panels are mounted across a 100-foot long run of wooden racks. No surprise, really, to see a photovoltaic system outside a company that sells the hardware.
\
But this set-up is way larger than needed to run lights and appliances. And therein lies the surprise: These solar panels generated enough power last winter to supply nearly 70 percent of the building's warmth -- with electric heat.
\
The falling price of photovoltaic panels, along with the advent of special heat pumps and super insulation, are creating an opportunity in Maine that energy experts could hardly imagine a few years ago. Now some of the state's leading solar installers, including Solar Market, have begun installing so-called PV panels on homes and businesses to harvest sunshine for baseboard heaters.
\
The new economics of PV panels also has some companies moving away from promoting solar-thermal collectors designed to heat water, a mainstay of the business in Maine for 30 years.
\
""We stopped selling solar hot water three years ago,"" said Naoto Inoue, who owns Solar Market and has hot-water panels on his house. ""I would never do it again. I would put up all PV.""
\
What's starting to happen in Maine reflects an era of dizzying change taking place in the global solar industry.
\
PV module prices are down 50 percent in the past three years; they've fallen by roughly one-third in the past 12 months. Manufacturing growth in China, among other factors, has led to overcapacity and financial losses. Trade publications predict that competition will continue to drive down prices next year, as the industry struggles to consolidate and match supply with demand.
\
Maine solar installers are taking advantage of this environment, as well as state and federal laws that encourage the use of renewable energy. A visit to Solar Market's 3,500 square foot office shows one way to do it.
\
Out back, the oversized solar system has a capacity of 50 kilowatts. In the summer, it can produce up to 300 percent more power than the business needs. The system is tied into the power grid, and Maine's net-metering law requires utilities to buy renewable power and credit any surplus to the customer's account. That allows Solar Market to bank much of its surplus for winter, when days are short and the office needs heat.
\
Typical electric resistance heaters would eat up too much energy, however. In the basement, Inoue has a high-efficiency, air-source heat pump. This device uses a relatively-small amount of electricity to extract the marginal heat in cold, outside air. The heat is transfered to water, which is stored in an insulated tank and circulated through baseboards.
\
This approach wouldn't work, if the building was drafty and poorly insulated. Inoue gutted the walls of the old farmhouse and barn to create an 18-inch thick cavity of foam block and cellulose. The walls now have an R-value of 40, twice that of a typical home. The roof is R-60. The building's tight enough now to be warmed with only 17 feet of baseboards, a radiant floor loop and a couple of infrared, electric space heaters.
\
Critical to this equation is a 30 percent federal tax credit that cuts the cost of the PV system to $105,000. That's still not cheap. But Inoue figures he's getting electricity at under 10 cents a kilowatt hour for the 25-year life of the system. That's already less than today's utility rates.
\
Homeowners thinking about this approach typically undertake new construction, but not always. In Sanford, Cliff Babkirk has been able to get 40 percent of the space heat at an existing house from PV panels. Babkirk heavily insulated and air-sealed the home, installed a heat pump and is careful with electric use. He also kept his oil boiler to heat water, using 100 gallons a year.
\
Babkirk's system costs $17,600 after tax credits and a state rebate. He's happy enough with the performance that he plans to add more panels and pull another 20 percent of his heat from the sun. Earlier this month, he hosted an open house that was part of a national tour of solar and energy-efficient homes.
\
""We wanted to let people see a regular house,"" he said.
\
The project was installed by ReVision Energy in Portland. The company has done more than a dozen PV-heat systems over the past year.
\
Most are in new construction, where heavy insulation can be installed from scratch. The company also favors newly developed air-source heat pumps that work well in Maine's cold climate, and cost roughly $4,000.
\
""It has opened the door to these opportunities, which seemed remote in 2008,"" said Fortunat Mueller, a partner.
\
Homeowners looking to heat with solar electricity need a frugal refrigerator, washing machine and lights. If they can cut their power demand to around 265 kilowatt hours a month, they can do a lot of the job with a 3.5 kilowatt PV system. That would cost roughly $14,000 after tax credits and rebates, Mueller estimated, plus the cost of one of two heat pumps.
\
""For that you are essentially prepaying your entire electric and fuel bill for the life of the home,"" he said. ""It is pretty amazing.""
\
Solar hot water, heated with thermal collectors, is a different story.
\
Hot water panels remain cheaper than solar electric. But in Maine, the panels produce more hot water in the summer than most homes need, and not enough in winter. Hot water can't be stored indefinitely, and there's no way to bank the energy in the form of utility credits.
\
These factors have tipped the balance away from solar hot water in Maine, in Inoue's view. Mueller, however, isn't ready to make that break.
\
""I don't think we're at a point yet where solar thermal stops making sense,"" he said.
\
But another variable for hot water has entered the picture in recent years: Hybrid water heaters. Available now at home improvement stores, they look like conventional water heaters, but use heat-pump technology to warm water for a fraction of the cost. That's making solar-electric panels an option for heating water, too, Mueller said.

This approach wouldn't work, if the building was drafty and poorly insulated. Inoue gutted the walls of the old farmhouse and barn to create an 18-inch thick cavity of foam block and cellulose. The walls now have an R-value of 40, twice that of a typical home. The roof is R-60. The building's tight enough now to be warmed with only 17 feet of baseboards, a radiant floor loop and a couple of infrared, electric space heaters.
\
Critical to this equation is a 30 percent federal tax credit that cuts the cost of the PV system to $105,000. That's still not cheap. But Inoue figures he's getting electricity at under 10 cents a kilowatt hour for the 25-year life of the system. That's already less than today's utility rates.
\
Homeowners thinking about this approach typically undertake new construction, but not always. In Sanford, Cliff Babkirk has been able to get 40 percent of the space heat at an existing house from PV panels. Babkirk heavily insulated and air-sealed the home, installed a heat pump and is careful with electric use. He also kept his oil boiler to heat water, using 100 gallons a year.
\
Babkirk's system costs $17,600 after tax credits and a state rebate. He's happy enough with the performance that he plans to add more panels and pull another 20 percent of his heat from the sun. Earlier this month, he hosted an open house that was part of a national tour of solar and energy-efficient homes.
\
""We wanted to let people see a regular house,"" he said.
\
The project was installed by ReVision Energy in Portland. The company has done more than a dozen PV-heat systems over the past year.
\
Most are in new construction, where heavy insulation can be installed from scratch. The company also favors newly developed air-source heat pumps that work well in Maine's cold climate, and cost roughly $4,000.
\
""It has opened the door to these opportunities, which seemed remote in 2008,"" said Fortunat Mueller, a partner.
\
Homeowners looking to heat with solar electricity need a frugal refrigerator, washing machine and lights. If they can cut their power demand to around 265 kilowatt hours a month, they can do a lot of the job with a 3.5 kilowatt PV system. That would cost roughly $14,000 after tax credits and rebates, Mueller estimated, plus the cost of one of two heat pumps.
\
""For that you are essentially prepaying your entire electric and fuel bill for the life of the home,"" he said. ""It is pretty amazing.""
\
Solar hot water, heated with thermal collectors, is a different story.
\
Hot water panels remain cheaper than solar electric. But in Maine, the panels produce more hot water in the summer than most homes need, and not enough in winter. Hot water can't be stored indefinitely, and there's no way to bank the energy in the form of utility credits.
\
These factors have tipped the balance away from solar hot water in Maine, in Inoue's view. Mueller, however, isn't ready to make that break.
\
""I don't think we're at a point yet where solar thermal stops making sense,"" he said.
\
But another variable for hot water has entered the picture in recent years: Hybrid water heaters. Available now at home improvement stores, they look like conventional water heaters, but use heat-pump technology to warm water for a fraction of the cost. That's making solar-electric panels an option for heating water, too, Mueller said.

395,"Even on an overcast day, David Kinney feels a warm glow when he looks up at the 144 solar panels installed in a grassy field located right next to the Lincolnville Fire Station off Route 52.\And on a sunny day, for the longtime Lincolnville town administrator, that satisfaction keeps growing. Just like the way the numbers of kilowatt hours the solar array generates for the town have been growing since the project went online at the end of 2016. Last year, the grid-tied panels converted sunshine into more than 56,000 kilowatt hours of electricity -- enough to keep a year's worth of lights on at both of the town's fire stations, the town office, the sand and salt building, Breezemere Park, the town pier and on the sidewalks at Lincolnville Beach.\Moving away from fossil fuel-driven energy has felt to many residents like the right thing to do, and it also has been good for the town's bottom line, Kinney said.\""It's proving its worth,"" he said, adding that he would encourage officials from other Maine communities to think about installing municipal solar arrays of their own. ""You owe it to your citizens to look at alternatives to what you're doing. You just can't continue to do what you've done in the past. We're spending other people's money, and we need to do that wisely.""\Solar on the move in Maine\It turns out, a lot of decision-makers in Maine cities and towns are on the same page. Solar projects on rooftops, in closed landfills and in other places have taken off in municipalities including Belfast, South Portland, Stockton Springs, Camden, Bar Harbor, Waldoboro, Waterville and Boothbay, among others. There are well over 25 existing municipal solar projects around the state, and the number is growing.\In the past decade, disparate factors have come together that have made it much more affordable to install arrays both big and small, experts said. The price of solar panel pieces has plummeted in the past 10 years, experts said. A sizeable federal tax credit for renewable energy systems that doesn't expire until 2021 has also really helped to entice municipalities to explore solar projects.\Some folks are even taking a more regional approach to renewable energy. A group of residents on Mount Desert Island is working toward energy independence for the island by 2030.\It's not just about the bottom line, of course, said Dylan Voorhees, the climate and clean energy project director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine. But without the benefit of the bottom line, it's unlikely that so many municipal projects would be getting off the ground.\""It works for rural Maine. It's not a political thing. It's about economics,"" he said. ""I think that there are communities where the environment matters. But folks are really in touch with town budgets. They pay for them through property taxes directly. I think that's the fundamental thing -- saving money is important across the board. And I think the long-term stability and predictability of it is really attractive to municipalities."" [image id=""2664581"" size=""full"" pos=""center"" /]\Room for growth\Maine, though, is not leading the nation or even New England in terms of solar energy adoption. In Vermont and other states, more solar arrays are erected on the side of the road or on residential and other rooftops than exist in Maine. In the Pine Tree State, solar energy projects recently have not had a lot of encouragement from political leaders including Gov. Paul LePage, who has used his veto pen repeatedly to kill bills that would support the solar power industry. In comparison, Vermont, which has many more solar installation companies and more solar arrays, has state policies in place that support the industry, including net metering rules that allow for compensation for small power generators.\""In Maine, we are artificially driving up the cost of solar. Thankfully, that's not stopping municipalities, but it's definitely making [projects] harder,"" Voorhees said. ""We're making it harder for solar to be accessible by keeping the lid on the industry.""\Still, Maine solar installation companies such as ReVision Energy, Sundog Solar and Insource Renewables have been busy getting projects such as municipal solar arrays off the ground. Municipalities often take advantage of something called a solar power purchase agreement, a financial arrangement in which a developer owns, operates and maintains the system, and the customer agrees to host the system and purchase its electric output from the solar services provider for a predetermined period. The rates are guaranteed and usually a little less than the current standard electric offer. David Kinney appreciates that his town's bills are now more consistent than before. In Lincolnville, where the electricity generated by the solar panels is fed back to the power grid, the town writes a monthly check to ReVision Energy and to Central Maine Power for transmission.\""Our bills are pretty consistent,"" Kinney said.\Chuck Piper of Searsport-based Sundog Solar said that municipalities the company has been working with signs a contract with Sundog to install the solar systems. Those systems, which must be paid for upfront, are purchased with the help of equal-opportunity lender Coastal Enterprises, Inc. The towns buy the solar power at a reduced rate, and the money helps to satisfy the loan. At the end of the loan, municipalities will own their solar arrays outright, thus reducing the cost of electricity even more.\""It's a nice arrangement for municipalities,"" Piper, the co-owner of the company, said. ""And municipalities are filling up our dance card. It is good work, and we're able to offer some good jobs.""\That's despite, not because of, the current political climate, he said.\""People want solar. They want clean energy. They want energy independence,"" he said. ""Utility companies across the region want people to continue to pay $100 per month for the rest of their lives, and we're offering a chance for energy independence.""\A goal of energy independence\John Luft of ReVision Energy, based in Liberty, said that installing projects such as the one by the Lincolnville fire station seem to be wins all around.\""Communities across Maine, New England and America want to see change,"" he said. ""We live in very, very polarized times. This is an area where people are actually coming together.""\And there is much more that can be done, he and others believe. Germany, with more than 82 million people and a robust economy, is a leader in renewable energy.\""On a sunny day in Germany, they get all their power from the sun,"" Luft said, adding that at best, Maine generates about 1 percent of its electricity from the sun. ""And we get 33 more sunny days than Germany. Maine is sitting on an incredible resource, and Maine is missing out.""\But some Mainers are working to change that, regardless of state or federal leadership. Joe Blotnick, the co-coordinator of A Climate to Thrive on Mount Desert Island, said his group has about 1,200 people on its mailing list, comprising residents from all over the island. They work with businesses, municipalities and citizens in an effort to reach the goal of energy independence by 2030 -- just more than 10 years from now. In the past two and a half years, they have worked to install 76 new solar arrays on homes around the island. A Climate To Thrive helped double the solar capacity on MDI, and they have goals to double it again in 2019 and again in 2020.\They're doing that now through larger projects, such as one being worked on now in the town of Tremont. If residents give the project final approval at Tremont's annual town meeting, which is coming up Saturday, Aug. 4, it will provide solar electricity for all town buildings and the school.\""It's really inspired the community to think about the future,"" Blotnick said. ""We've had to do the work at the local level, and it's working because it makes economic sense.""\But there's no denying the rush he gets on a sunny day, when solar panels around the island he loves are generating clean electricity to power it -- electricity that comes from the sun and is far removed from fossil fuels.\""It's really great,"" he said. ""A really good feeling.""\Follow the Bangor Daily News on Facebook for the latest Maine news.\Credit: Abigail Curtis BDN Staff"
396,"Efforts to expand natural gas capacity. Hopes of luring discounted Canadian electricity. Measures to stunt the growth of solar power and discourage wind farms on land and sea.\These actions championed for eight years by Gov. Paul LePage and Republican allies will end on Jan. 2, as a new Democratic governor and Legislature abruptly shift the focus of Maine's energy policy to boosting local, green-power development and blunting the impacts of a warming climate.\""From warming seas and rising ocean waters to an increase in the tick population, climate change is hammering our state and will have a significant impact on our economy,"" said Gov.-elect Janet Mills, responding via email to the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram. ""As governor, I will prioritize fighting climate change by embracing and advancing a clean-energy future, including, for example, supporting UMaine's offshore wind research and by providing incentives for community solar and rooftop solar.""\Mills said her administration will focus on reducing the carbon emissions that accelerate climate change and work with communities, especially along the coast where sea levels are rising, to help make them more resilient.\Those efforts will be aided by a Legislature in which Republicans concerned about the costs of clean-energy incentives, especially in the House, can no longer block bills aimed at expanding renewable energy.\""For eight years, we've had an administration closed for business for Maine-based clean energy and jobs,"" said Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham. ""That's about to change, 180 degrees.""\Berry, who's expected to stay on as co-chairman of the legislative committee that handles energy matters, said one message from the midterm election is that most Mainers want progress on clean-energy policies.\""It's a new day for renewables in Maine and the forecast is for sunny skies,"" he said.\But that forecast isn't as clear as it may seem.\Energy policies typically carry embedded costs, in the form of tax breaks, utility rate surcharges or public spending. A challenge for Democrats is to make choices that will advance a clean-energy agenda that makes consumers feel they're coming out ahead or, at least, not being hit with higher bills.\Mills didn't directly answer a question regarding the willingness of Mainers to pay to fund a clean-energy economy. But she said she plans to work closely with the Legislature on policies that, among other things, would ""create jobs and grow our economy, and not contribute to an increase in our energy costs and ratepayers' bills.""\Berry answered a similar question this way: ""We need to make sure the benefits outweigh the costs of any measure we enact.""\CHANGING DYNAMIC\Debate over costs and benefits has been at the center of energy policy for decades.\Maine is the nation's most petroleum-dependent state, where six in 10 homes are warmed by oil and virtually all transportation runs on gasoline. All of it's imported, sending billions of dollars out of state. Conversely, roughly half the state's net electricity generation comes from hydropower and wood biomass and - despite opposition - 20 percent comes from wind.\That sounds impressive, but overall electric rates are driven higher by cold-weather spikes in the cost of natural gas, used to fuel many power plants in New England. So while Maine's average electric rates are the lowest in the region, they are 12th highest in the country.\The high cost of energy has been a signature issue for LePage, but he largely came up short. He unsuccessfully tried to coax cheaper power out of Quebec and was part of failed regional efforts to get utility customers to help pay for new gas pipelines. He was, however, able to block efforts that favored Maine-based renewables, complaining that they imposed extra costs on Mainers.\He was especially critical of a billing practice that reimbursed homeowners with rooftop solar for 100 percent of the retail cost of the electricity they sent back to the grid. LePage described the practice, known as net-metering, as shifting costs onto lower-income Mainers to subsidize the solar installations of wealthier Mainers.\LePage and a key energy adviser, Jim LaBrecque, harbored such animosity toward solar incentives that it became a litmus test for legislators. For three years running, LePage was able to sway enough House Republicans to uphold his veto of bills meant to increase solar installations, in each case by three or fewer votes.\That dynamic will be gone. The new mix of lawmakers could create a more collegial environment where more Republicans are willing to work with Democrats to find compromises on clean energy, according to Sen. David Woodsome, R-North Waterboro.\""We're not going to have the do-or-die attitude of LePage and LaBrecque and a few others,"" said Woodsome, who served with Berry last session as co-chairman of the energy committee. ""Every time you mentioned solar, the hair on their necks went up. You couldn't reason with them.""\It's too soon to say how House Republicans will react to a clean-energy agenda.\Rep. Ken Fredette, R-Newport, the current House Republican leader, helped LePage derail many clean-energy overtures. In a scoring of lawmakers by the Maine Conservation Voters, Fredette earned a zero in 2018 and a 22 percent lifetime score.\The incoming House minority leader, Rep. Kathleen Dillingham, R-Oxford, has a less strident record with the advocacy group. She scored 63 percent in 2018, and 43 percent lifetime, with a mixed record on solar bills. Dillingham didn't respond to a request for comment.\RENEWED SUPPORT FOR SOLAR?\Solar policy is high on the list of things likely to get immediate attention this session.\Maine lacks the rebates, tax credits or exemptions that drive robust solar growth in some states. And in the past two years, rules at the Public Utilities Commission around how solar power is compensated and metered have seemed punitive to advocates.\Look for attempts in the Legislature to change the PUC rules. And look for the tenor of the PUC to change, as well. All three current commissioners were appointed by LePage and the term of the chairman, Mark Vannoy, expires in March. Mills will get to nominate his replacement, who's expected to be friendly to clean energy.\Beyond that, Berry and others say, lawmakers might dust off and update a far-reaching solar bill that had broad bipartisan support when it was debated in 2016, but fell victim to a LePage veto. That bill featured new ways to create financial incentives. It also lifted an artificial cap to greatly increase the number of electric customers who could plug into solar through so-called community farms, something Mills said she's planning to do, anyway.\Besides solar, other priorities are shaping up:\\n\\\n\\\n\\Today, an effort by a University of Maine-led consortium to test a floating wind farm off Monhegan is stalled at the PUC over the price of the power contract, while the study commission is working on a report about wind turbines and tourism. Expect Mills and Democratic leaders to try to advance the power contract, which is crucial to federal funding for the project. Any wind panel findings, meanwhile, likely will be dead on arrival.\Mills and Democrats also will confront some energy issues that aren't as clear-cut, such as transportation.\Cars and trucks are Maine's leading contributor to climate change. Mills said she'll support policies that increase the number of electric vehicles and charging stations, but didn't say how to pay for that.\""It's a huge example and the elephant in the room,"" said Dylan Voorhees, clean-energy director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine.\Funding options have pros and cons, he said. In some states, money from the general fund or excise taxes provide rebates for plug-in vehicles. Power companies offer discount charging rates in California. Colorado offers an income tax credit.\Weatherizing Maine's old housing stock is an ongoing challenge. Efficiency Maine and MaineHousing offer various rebate, grant and loan programs. Mills said she'll tap voter-approved bonds for senior housing and energy efficiency that LePage has declined to authorize.\""The $15 million in senior housing and weatherization bonds will be signed as soon as I take office,"" Mills said.\EXERCISING RESTRAINT\As Democrats develop a game plan, they may find some guidance in a new initiative to develop a broad policy to make Maine energy-independent by 2030.\The effort is being led by A Climate To Thrive, a grassroots group working on a similar goal on Mount Desert Island. Organizers hosted a meeting this month in Augusta that attracted 30 activists and lawmakers.\Part of the discussion focused on drafting a comprehensive renewable energy bill supported by a suite of ""building block"" bills around solar, wind, transportation and efficiency. Each would have measurable impacts on jobs, economic growth, energy costs and other indicators.\But among some participants, there's a wariness about trying to do too much, too soon.\Voters in Washington state, for instance, this month rejected a proposed tax on carbon dioxide emissions. It was a first-in-the-nation attempt to raise the cost of driving and heating with fossil fuels, and shift money to clean energy.\""There isn't a mandate in Maine for every energy idea that Democrats have had over the last eight years,"" said Jeremy Payne, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association.\Payne said it's important for measures to gain bipartisan support, because the majority of Maine voters are unenrolled. With another election just two years away, they will punish politicians who don't spend taxpayer money wisely.\""The pendulum always swings back,"" Payne said.\Tux Turkel can be contacted at 791-6462 or at:\tturkel@pressherald.com\Twitter: TuxTurkel"

""As governor, I will prioritize fighting climate change by embracing and advancing a clean energy future, including, for example, supporting UMaine's offshore wind research and by providing incentives for community solar and rooftop solar."" \Mills said her administration will focus on reducing the carbon emissions that accelerate climate change and work with communities, especially along the coast where sea levels are rising, to help make them more resilient.\Those efforts will be aided by a Legislature in which Republicans concerned about the costs of clean-energy incentives, especially in the House, can no longer block bills aimed at expanding renewable energy.\""For eight years, we've had an administration closed for business for Maine-based clean energy and jobs,"" said Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham. ""That's about to change, 180 degrees.""\Berry, who's expected to stay on as co-chairman of the legislative committee that handles energy matters, said one message from the midterm election is that most Mainers want progress on clean-energy policies. \""It's a new day for renewables in Maine and the forecast is for sunny skies,"" he said. But that forecast isn't as clear as it may seem.\Energy policies typically carry embedded costs, in the form of tax breaks, utility rate surcharges or public spending. A challenge for Democrats is to make choices that will advance a clean-energy agenda that makes consumers feel they're coming out ahead or, at least, not being hit with higher bills.\Mills didn't directly answer a question regarding the willingness of Mainers to pay to fund a clean-energy economy. But she said she plans to work closely with the Legislature on policies that, among other things, would ""create jobs and grow our economy, and not contribute to an increase in our energy costs and ratepayers' bills.""\Berry answered a similar question this way: ""We need to make sure the benefits outweigh the costs of any measure we enact.""\Debate over costs and benefits has been at the center of energy policy for decades. \Maine is the nation's most petroleum-dependent state, where six in 10 homes are warmed by oil and virtually all transportation runs on gasoline. All of it's imported, sending billions of dollars out of state. Conversely, roughly half the state's net electricity generation comes from hydropower and wood biomass and -- despite opposition -- 20 percent comes from wind. \That sounds impressive, but overall electric rates are driven higher by cold-weather spikes in the cost of natural gas, used to fuel many power plants in New England. So while Maine's average electric rates are the lowest in the region, they are 12th highest in the country.\The high cost of energy has been a signature issue for LePage, but he largely came up short. He unsuccessfully tried to coax cheaper power out of Quebec and was part of failed regional efforts to get utility customers to help pay for new gas pipelines. He was, however, able to block efforts that favored Maine-based renewables, complaining that they imposed extra costs on Mainers. \He was especially critical of a billing practice that reimbursed homeowners with rooftop solar for 100 percent of the retail cost of the electricity they sent back to the grid. LePage described the practice, known as net-metering, as shifting costs onto lower-income Mainers to subsidize the solar installations of wealthier Mainers.\LePage and a key energy adviser, Jim LaBrecque, harbored such animosity toward solar incentives that it became a litmus test for legislators. For three years running, LePage was able to sway enough House Republicans to uphold his veto of bills meant to increase solar installations, in each case by three or fewer votes.\That dynamic will be gone. The new mix of lawmakers could create a more collegial environment where more Republicans are willing to work with Democrats to find compromises on clean energy, according to Sen. David Woodsome, R-North Waterboro.\""We're not going to have the do-or-die attitude of LePage and LaBrecque and a few others,"" said Woodsome, who served with Berry last session as co-chairman of the energy committee. ""Every time you mentioned solar, the hair on their necks went up. You couldn't reason with them.""\It's too soon to say how House Republicans will react to a clean-energy agenda.\Rep. Ken Fredette, R-Newport, the current House Republican leader, helped LePage derail many clean-energy overtures. In a scoring of lawmakers by the Maine Conservation Voters scores, Fredette earned a zero in 2018 and a 22 percent lifetime score.\The incoming House minority leader, Rep. Kathleen Dillingham, R-Oxford, has a less-strident record with the advocacy group. She scored 63 percent in 2018, and 43 percent lifetime, with a mixed record on solar bills. Dillingham didn't respond to a request for comment.\Solar policy is high on the list of things likely to get immediate attention this session.\Maine lacks the rebates, tax credits or exemptions that drive robust solar growth in some states. And in the past two years, rules at the Public Utilities Commission around how solar power is compensated and metered have seemed punitive to advocates. \Look for attempts in the Legislature to change the PUC rules. And look for the tenor of the PUC to change, as well. All three current commissioners were appointed by LePage and the term of the chairman, Mark Vannoy, expires in March. Mills will get to nominate his replacement, who's expected to be friendly to clean energy. \Beyond that, Berry and others say, lawmakers might dust off and update a far-reaching solar bill that had broad bipartisan support when it was debated in 2016, but fell victim to a LePage veto. That bill featured new ways to create financial incentives. It also lifted an artificial cap to greatly increase the number of electric customers who could plug into solar through so-called community farms, something Mills said she's planning to do, anyway.\Besides solar, other priorities are shaping up:\[bullet] State energy agency: LePage is operating the agency as an extension of his office, with three people. A failed, bipartisan bill last session aimed to create a Cabinet-level agency with a commissioner, to give Maine more clout in regional policy negotiations. Democrats may revive that bill, and seek money to increase staff and responsibilities.\[bullet] Renewable portfolio standard: As do most states, Maine requires a certain percentage of its power supply to come from renewable energy, subsidized by electric customers. But Maine's law is nearly 19 years old, and isn't working as intended. Tuneup efforts in recent years have broken down amid partisan disagreements. Democrats will be under pressure to craft rules that spur a new round of local investment, without hurting consumers.\[bullet] Wind energy: LePage's opposition to wind power and the financial incentives that aid its growth are legendary in energy circles. They include actions that prompted a Norwegian energy company to abandon its test of a $120 million floating wind farm in 2013, as well as forming a secretive study commission on the impacts of land-based wind early in 2018. \Today, an effort by a University of Maine-led consortium to test a floating wind farm off Monhegan is stalled at the PUC over the price of the power contract, while the study commission is working on a report about wind turbines and tourism. Expect Mills and Democratic leaders to try to advance the power contract, which is crucial to federal funding for the project. Any wind panel findings, meanwhile, likely will be dead on arrival. \Mills and Democrats also will confront some energy issues that aren't as clear-cut, such as transportation.\Cars and trucks are Maine's leading contributor to climate change. Mills said she'll support policies that increase the number of electric vehicles and charging stations, but didn't say how to pay for that. \""It's a huge example and the elephant in the room,"" said Dylan Voorhees, clean energy director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine. \Funding options have pros and cons, he said. In some states, money from the general fund or excise taxes provide rebates for plug-in vehicles. Power companies offer discount charging rates in California. Colorado offers an income tax credit.\Weatherizing Maine's old housing stock is an ongoing challenge. Efficiency Maine and MaineHousing offer various rebate, grant and loan programs. Mills said she'll tap voter-approved bonds for senior housing and energy efficiency that LePage has declined to authorize. \""The $15 million in senior housing and weatherization bonds will be signed as soon as I take office,"" Mills said.\As Democrats develop a game plan, they may find some guidance in a new initiative to develop a broad policy to make Maine energy-independent by 2030.\The effort is being led by A Climate To Thrive, a grassroots group working on a similar goal on Mount Desert Island. Organizers hosted a meeting this month in Augusta that attracted 30 activists and lawmakers. \Part of the discussion focused on drafting a comprehensive renewable energy bill supported by a suite of ""building block"" bills around solar, wind, transportation and efficiency. Each would have measurable impacts on jobs, economic growth, energy costs and other indicators. \But among some participants, there's a wariness about trying to do too much, too soon.\Voters in Washington state, for instance, this month rejected a proposed tax on carbon dioxide emissions. It was a first-in-the-nation attempt to raise the cost of driving and heating with fossil-fuels, and shift money to clean energy.\""There isn't a mandate in Maine for every energy idea that Democrats have had over the last eight years,"" said Jeremy Payne, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association.\Payne said it's important for measures to gain bipartisan support, because the majority of Maine voters are unenrolled. With another election just two years away, they will punish politicians who don't spend taxpayer money wisely.\""The pendulum always swings back,"" Payne said.\Tux Turkel -- 791-6462\tturkel@pressherald.com\Twitter: TuxTurkel\Credit: By TUX TURKEL Maine Sunday Telegram"
398,"AUGUSTA -- In 2012, Gov. Paul LePage introduced a bill designed to lower electric costs. To advance his vision, he needed to convince lawmakers that removing a limit on renewable energy credits for hydropower would unleash a flood of cheap power from Quebec. \He was unable to do that, and the bill died in the Legislature. \In the next two legislative sessions, the governor or a Republican ally on the committee that handles energy issues reintroduced essentially the same bill, with the same outcome. This month, Rep. Beth O'Connor, R-Berwick, gave it another try.\It has become a joke among lobbyists and some state officials that if it's March, it's time to dust off their testimony for or against the 100-megawatt cap, as the bill has become known. \The stalemate over the cap is emblematic of LePage's track record on energy.\The high cost of energy is a signature issue for LePage. He mentions it frequently, highlighting the burden on low-income Mainers and businesses, even warning twice over the past two years about large employers that were poised to leave the state because of energy costs, although those specific departures didn't happen. \But after six years in office, the governor's accomplishments on energy are mixed. He has helped keep electric rates essentially flat, opposing measures that could make them higher than they might otherwise be. At the same time, he has largely failed to advance policies that actually lower the price of energy -- his often-stated goal.\His prospects for making progress in lowering prices look even worse this year.\His big plans to expand natural gas pipeline capacity and import power from Canada are stalled. Meanwhile, the governor has gone into his last full session of the Legislature without a permanent energy director, at war with his own appointees to the Public Utilities Commission and Office of Public Advocate, and lacking a cohesive agenda for lawmakers on the energy committee to consider.\LePage's clearest achievement may be his support for a massive rollout of super-efficient electric heat pumps that are cutting oil use in homes and small businesses.\Beyond advancing heat pumps, the governor mostly has been playing defense, blocking almost every initiative that could add a penny or more to an electric bill, from rooftop solar and utility-scale wind power to energy efficiency.\Although Maine's overall electric rates are the lowest in New England, LePage insists that they should be on par with regions fueled by coal and federally subsidized hydro projects. But his frequent attacks on the cost of homegrown, renewable power obscure a historic change taking place in wholesale energy markets.\The headline is that the price of making electricity is falling while the cost of getting it to homes and businesses has risen. This reversal has made the cost of delivering power a bigger portion of a home electric bill than the price of producing energy.\But LePage's energy priorities don't seem to recognize these facts, said Sen. Mark Dion, D-Portland.\""I don't think there's a full appreciation that cheap power requires affordable transmission,"" said Dion, who sits on the energy committee and is a former co-chairman.\Dion said he shares the governor's goal of reducing oil dependence. At the urging of industrial energy users, Dion is sponsoring a bill to extend a deadline by which Maine must decide about investing in natural gas pipeline capacity in New England. Aimed at increasing gas supply and lowering electric generating costs in the winter, it's a major priority of LePage and Republican leaders. It was the cornerstone of the Omnibus Energy Bill passed in 2013.\But LePage opposed the omnibus bill. He was angry that it didn't remove the 100-megawatt cap, and that the Maine Public Utilities Commission had approved an above-market power rate contract for a floating wind farm to be built as a pilot project by the Norwegian energy giant Statoil. He wanted the agency to redo the contract to favor a competing project led by the University of Maine.\The bill passed. LePage vetoed it, but the Legislature overrode his veto with broad support from Republicans. Rebuffed, Statoil left the state; the university-led project is trying to get into the water in 2019.\For now, gas expansion in Maine is essentially dead because a court decision in Massachusetts, the region's largest gas consumer, forbids ratepayers from being billed for pipeline projects.\The governor also has tangled over funding for Efficiency Maine, the trust that oversees efforts to use less energy. He objects to using surcharges on electric bills to help fund the quasi-state agency and wants more control over it. \His opposition came to a head in 2015, when a clerical error in a law funding the agency required a one-word legislative fix. The fix added $59 million to the trust, but also raised customer bills from 78 cents a month to $3.13. The bill was vetoed by LePage, but both the House and Senate voted unanimously to override the veto.\LePage's refusal to compromise, a hallmark of his governing style, set the tone for future dealings on energy matters. But he was fortunate to have hired two energy directors who developed a good rapport with the Legislature. \The first was Ken Fletcher, a longtime Republican lawmaker who had served on the committee. He left in 2013. \Fletcher was followed by Patrick Woodcock, an adviser in Washington, D.C., to former U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe. Woodcock resigned in November. He had become the go-to person for anyone trying to decipher LePage's position on energy details. ""There's a tremendous void there now,"" said Sen. David Woodsome, R-Waterboro, the committee's co-chairman. ""He was very knowledgeable. He tried to build consensus. It's a huge loss.""\With Woodcock gone, and only weeks before the Legislature reconvened, the task of conveying LePage's energy agenda fell to Angela Monroe. She's a veteran PUC analyst who's serving as the governor's acting energy director, but she lacks the relationships developed by Fletcher and Woodcock. \Woodcock reached out to the committee chairmen, meeting over lunch, discussing policy and looking for areas of compromise, Dion said. Monroe isn't widely known by lawmakers. And the fact that LePage apparently has no plans to name a permanent director is raising questions about how forcefully he'll be able to convey new ideas to the Legislature.\LePage didn't respond to a request for comment on this story.\Monroe, who consented to answer questions via email, said she's drafting bills, providing testimony and working with the committee. \And she noted that during the governor's tenure, retail electricity prices in Maine fell by 1 percent, while they rose in the rest of New England by 20 percent. Nationally, retail electricity rates rose 11 percent over that span, from 9.28 cents per kilowatt-hour to 10.31 cents. In Maine, they fell from 12.84 cents in 2010 to 12.78 cents in 2015, according to federal data. \Monroe declined to discuss the reasons, but southern New England states generally have chosen to purchase and encourage more renewable power generation at above-market costs. That's a contrast to Le-Page's opposition to solar and wind, and an explanation of how Maine has kept rates from rising as much. \As the legislative session shifts into high gear, LePage may tap a former three-term lawmaker who served on the energy committee. \Larry Dunphy, a former Republican who withdrew from the party in 2015 and completed his term unaffiliated, confirmed that LePage met with him last week about working part time. Dunphy is a blunt-talking former paper worker who knows his way around the Legislature.\""I could be a liaison to the committee,"" he said. ""I think the governor is trying to do the right thing, which is lower the cost of energy without damaging the environment.""\Dunphy's policy experience could complement the hands-on expertise of Jim LeBrecque, who has functioned as LePage's unpaid ""technical adviser"" on energy matters. LeBrecque plans to start working part time in a paid position for the governor.\A refrigeration expert with an engineering focus, LeBrecque was the driving force behind heat pumps. He informs the governor's opposition to solar and wind energy. He also plans to promote an unconventional idea of powering heat pumps in Maine with hydroelectricity from Quebec, a concept he tried to explain to the committee this month while testifying against the 100-megawatt cap.\But in the Legislature, LeBrecque is known for dissertations and strident viewpoints. Asked whether LeBrecque could communicate for the governor effectively, Woodsome, the committee co-chairman, said he wasn't sure.\""Things are black and white for him,"" Woodsome said. ""He's a nickels and pennies guy.""\LeBrecque shares the governor's frustration with recent action of LePage's PUC appointees, who voted in January on a compromise plan that keeps for 15 years key financial incentives for existing rooftop solar panels and phases them out for new systems. LePage wants the incentives eliminated now, and said last month that he'd ask the three commissioners to resign, if he could.\As it happens, the term of one of the commissioners, Carlisle McLean, is up this month. McLean is LePage's former legal counsel. It's unclear whether LePage will nominate someone else, although it's known in energy circles that he's considering other candidates. \Regardless, his statements sent a clear political message to a quasi-judicial panel, which considers itself an impartial arbiter guided by law and legislative directive.\LeBrecque, meanwhile, has gone on conservative talk radio to decry the PUC for being made up of lawyers, ignoring the fact that the current chairman is an engineer and the third member is a utility economist.\LePage's ire extends to his public advocate, whom he appointed in 2013. But he lost confidence in Tim Schneider, who represents utility customers, after Schneider helped broker a compromise solar energy bill that LePage opposed last year in the Legislature.\LePage later told a conservative talk radio host that picking Schneider was ""one of the worst, worst decisions ever in my life.""\Schneider's term expires in May. He said recently that he doesn't expect to be reappointed.\Taken together, the disorder on energy policy has even some of the governor's strongest supporters frustrated.\The 100-megawatt cap bill does have support, from parties that include Central Maine Power Co. and Schneider's office. But opponents have made a consistent case that Quebec exports hydro power at market prices, not discounts, that it has no direct transmission lines connecting to Maine, and that Canadian imports would hurt local generators. For these and other reasons, there's no indication that the bill will fare any better in 2017.\O'Connor, who introduced the latest 100-megawatt cap bill, lamented the governor's testy relationship with lawmakers and his inability to move ideas through the legislative process.

He mentions it frequently, highlighting the burden on low-income Mainers and businesses, even warning twice over the past two years about large employers that were poised to leave the state because of energy costs, although those specific departures didn't happen. \But after six years in office, the governor's accomplishments on energy are mixed. He has helped keep electric rates essentially flat, opposing measures that could make them higher than they might otherwise be. At the same time, he has largely failed to advance policies that actually lower the price of energy - his often-stated goal. \His prospects for making progress lowering prices look even worse this year. \His big plans to expand natural gas pipeline capacity and import power from Canada are stalled. Meanwhile, the governor has gone into his last full session of the Legislature without a permanent energy director, at war with his own appointees to the Public Utilities Commission and Office of Public Advocate, and lacking a cohesive agenda for lawmakers on the energy committee to consider. \LePage's clearest achievement may be his support for a massive rollout of super-efficient electric heat pumps that are cutting oil use in homes and small businesses. \Beyond advancing heat pumps, the governor mostly has been playing defense, standing between almost every initiative that could add a penny or more to an electric bill, from rooftop solar and utility-scale wind power to energy efficiency. \Although Maine's overall electric rates are the lowest in New England, LePage insists that they should be on par with regions fueled by coal and federally subsidized hydro projects. But his frequent attacks on the cost of homegrown, renewable power obscure a historic change taking place in wholesale energy markets. \The headline is that the price of making electricity is falling while the cost of getting it to homes and businesses has risen. This reversal has made the cost of delivering power a bigger portion of a home electric bill than the price of producing energy. \But LePage's energy priorities don't seem to recognize these facts, said Sen. Mark Dion, D-Portland. \""I don't think there's a full appreciation that cheap power requires affordable transmission,"" said Dion, who sits on the energy committee and is a former co-chairman. \Dion said he shares the governor's goal of reducing oil dependence. At the urging of industrial energy users, Dion is sponsoring a bill to extend a deadline by which Maine must decide about investing in natural gas pipeline capacity in New England. Aimed at increasing gas supply and lowering electric generating costs in the winter, it's a major priority of LePage and Republican leaders. It was the cornerstone of the Omnibus Energy Bill passed in 2013. \But LePage opposed the omnibus bill. He was mad that it didn't remove the 100-megawatt cap, and that the Maine Public Utilities Commission had approved an above-market power rate contract for a floating wind farm to be built as a pilot project by the Norwegian energy giant Statoil. He wanted the agency to redo the contract to favor a competing project led by the University of Maine. \The bill passed. LePage vetoed it, but the Legislature overrode his veto with broad support from Republicans. Rebuffed, Statoil left the state; the university-led project is trying to get in the water in 2019. \For now, gas expansion in Maine is essentially dead because a court decision in Massachusetts, the region's largest gas consumer, forbids ratepayers from being billed for pipeline projects. \ENERGY FOOT SOLDIERS \The governor also has tangled over funding for Efficiency Maine, the trust that oversees efforts to use less energy. He objects to using surcharges on electric bills to help fund the quasi-state agency and wants more control over it. \His opposition came to a head in 2015, when a clerical error in a law funding the agency required a one-word legislative fix. The fix added $59 million to the trust, but also raised customer bills from 78 cents a month to $3.13. The bill was vetoed by LePage, but both the House and Senate voted unanimously to override the veto. \LePage's refusal to compromise, a hallmark of his governing style, set the tone for future dealings on energy matters. But he was fortunate to have hired two energy directors who developed a good rapport with the Legislature. \The first was Ken Fletcher, a longtime Republican lawmaker who had served on the committee. He left in 2013. \Fletcher was followed by Patrick Woodcock, an adviser in Washington, D.C., to former U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe. Woodcock resigned in November. He had become the go-to person for anyone trying to decipher LePage's position on energy details. \""There's a tremendous void there now,"" said Sen. David Woodsome, R-Waterboro, the committee's co-chairman. ""He was very knowledgeable. He tried to build consensus. It's a huge loss."" \With Woodcock gone, and only weeks before the Legislature reconvened, the task of conveying LePage's energy agenda fell to Angela Monroe. She's a veteran PUC analyst who's serving as the governor's acting energy director, but she lacks the relationships developed by Fletcher and Woodcock. \Woodcock reached out to the committee chairmen, meeting over lunch, discussing policy and looking for areas of compromise, Dion said. Monroe isn't widely known by lawmakers. And the fact that LePage apparently has no plans to name a permanent director is raising questions about how forcefully he'll be able to convey new ideas to the Legislature. \LePage didn't respond to a request for comment on this story. \Monroe, who consented to answer questions via email, said she's drafting bills, providing testimony and working with the committee. \And she noted that during the governor's tenure, retail electricity prices in Maine fell by 1 percent, while they rose in the rest of New England by 20 percent. Nationally, retail electricity rates rose 11 percent over that span, from 9.28 cents per kilowatt-hour to 10.31 cents. In Maine, they fell from 12.84 cents in 2010, to 12.78 cents in 2015, according to federal data. \Monroe declined to discuss the reasons, but southern New England states generally have chosen to purchase and encourage more renewable power generation at above-market costs. That's a contrast to LePage's opposition to solar and wind, and an explanation of how Maine has kept rates from rising as much. \As the legislative session shifts into high gear, LePage may tap a former three-term lawmaker who served on the energy committee. \Larry Dunphy, a former Republican who withdrew from the party in 2015 and completed his term unaffiliated, confirmed that LePage met with him last week about working part time. Dunphy is a blunt-talking, former paper worker who knows his way around the Legislature. \""I could be a liaison to the committee,"" he said. ""I think the governor is trying to do the right thing, which is lower the cost of energy without damaging the environment."" \Dunphy's policy experience could complement the hands-on expertise of Jim LeBrecque, who has functioned as LePage's unpaid ""technical adviser"" on energy matters. LeBrecque plans to start working part time in a paid position for the governor. \A refrigeration expert with an engineering focus, LeBrecque was the driving force behind heat pumps. He informs the governor's opposition to solar and wind energy. He also plans to promote an unconventional idea of powering heat pumps in Maine with hydroelectricity from Quebec, a concept he tried to explain to the committee this month while testifying against the 100-megawatt cap. \But in the Legislature, LeBrecque is known for dissertations and strident viewpoints. Asked whether LeBrecque could effectively communicate for the governor, Woodsome, the committee co-chairman, said he wasn't sure. \""Things are black and white for him,"" Woodsome said. ""He's a nickels and pennies guy."" \OUT OF FAVOR \LeBrecque shares the governor's frustration with recent action of his PUC appointees, who voted in January on a compromise plan that keeps for 15 years key financial incentives for existing rooftop solar panels and phases them out for new systems. LePage wants the incentives eliminated now, and said last month that he'd ask the three commissioners to resign, if he could. \As it happens, the term of one of the commissioners, Carlisle McLean, is up this month. McLean is LePage's former legal counsel. It's unclear whether LePage will nominate someone else, although it's known in energy circles that he's considering other candidates. \Regardless, his statements sent a clear political message to a quasi-judicial panel, which considers itself an impartial arbiter guided by law and legislative directive. \LeBrecque, meanwhile, has gone on conservative talk radio to decry the PUC for being made up of lawyers, ignoring the fact that the current chairman is an engineer and the third member is a utility economist. \LePage's ire extends to his public advocate, whom he appointed in 2013. But he lost confidence in Tim Schneider, who represents utility customers, after Schneider helped broker a compromise solar energy bill that LePage opposed last year in the Legislature. \LePage later told a conservative talk radio host that picking Schneider was ""one of the worst, worst decisions ever in my life."" \Schneider's term expires in May. He said recently that he doesn't expect to be reappointed. \TESTY RELATIONSHIPS \Taken together, the disorder on energy policy has even some of the governor's strongest supporters frustrated. \The 100-megawatt cap bill does have support, from parties that include Central Maine Power and Schneider's office. But opponents have made a consistent case that Quebec exports hydro power at market prices, not discounts, that it has no direct transmission lines connecting Maine, and that Canadian imports would hurt local generators. For these and other reasons, there's no indication that the bill will fare any better in 2017. \O'Connor, who introduced the latest 100-megawatt cap bill, lamented the governor's testy relationship with lawmakers and his inability to move ideas through the legislative process. She blamed partisan politics but, beyond heat pumps, was unable to give a specific example of what the governor had promoted that lowered energy costs. \""He hasn't been able to do much, and it's a problem,"" she said. \This spring, though, the governor may play a pivotal role in energy policy. \Democrats and their clean-energy allies are drafting a bill to replace the PUC's new rule on solar, which also displeases them. \It would codify the financial incentives for rooftop solar, known as net metering. And in a move that's sure to anger the governor, the bill would create millions of dollars in rebates, paid for by electric customers. \Last year, the Legislature fell two votes short of overriding LePage's veto of a hard-fought solar bill. Similar dynamics are shaping up this year. Whatever its merits, rooftop solar has garnered great public interest. So even with a diminished ability to promote what he likes, LePage can influence energy policy by fighting what he hates.

House District 1: (Map) Kittery (part)
Deane Rykerson (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Lack of planning. We need to look at the future and invest in statewide broadband and renewable energy.
[image id=""2706600"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Budget surplus.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
A safety net for all Mainers.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, mileage and weight fee rather than increased gas tax.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Renewable energy creates jobs, lessens health problems, enhances Maine's environment, stops money from leaving the state for fossil fuels, and slows the effects of climate disruption.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Loosened. Access for all who need it.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
For Question 1. There is no reason the wealthy should pay less percentage of taxes than the middle class.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, ranked choice worked well in primaries.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine's economic development barriers are workforce and infrastructure. Demographically, we have been an aging state for over a decade and our state needs to continue the work around technology and educational systems to attract innovation and growth to Maine. I know Mainers have the hard work in them to make a bright future possible.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The funding of Medicaid expansion will be an important issue for the next Legislature and one with potentially significant impact to the state budget. We must focus on taking care of those most in need and find a sustainable, balanced solution. The next legislature working with the new Governor needs to find adequate dollars within the state budget. It's worth looking across ideas such as the exchanges and the Healthy Maine Fund if they can fit into a sustainable, fiscally responsible answer.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
To me, welfare reform means providing solid routes back to self-sufficiency. Assistance to Mainers in need is important �"" and part of that is being a bridge to independence. It makes fiscal sense to move people from dependency to self-sufficiency. There are opportunities to implement work search and volunteer requirements on Temporary Assistance For Needy Families recipients would comply with federal law. We want and need adults returning to work.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Reviewing how roads and bridges are maintained thru town, county and state funds is part of addressing Maine's infrastructure needs. We know that the gas tax approach is under pressure from fuel efficiency and electric vehicles, as well as just normal inflation. We need to look at how roads are paid for and what is needed for us to get the bridges, roads and transportation system we need today and for tomorrow that won't over burden the most vulnerable among us.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Incentives for renewable energy technologies as part of Maine's overall energy portfolio is a worthwhile discussion as long as one recognizes that incentives cannot come at the expense of rate payers. Since Maine is a net energy exporter, the market is doing a good. The price of transmission has increased 250% over that same period and that may bear looking at.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
At this time, Maine has a balanced approach to respecting the decision made in Roe v Wade
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting no on Question 1. There are many concerns with this initiative �"" from oversight to wait list issues, from the incredibly high tax burden to privacy concerns. It's an example of why it is imperative that Maine return to the legislative process. Aging in place is an important conversation that deserves a better solution for Maine's seniors.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I am not in favor at this time of a constitutional amendment to allow rank choice voting. We are at a time where we want to encourage more voting �"" not make it more complicated and in many ways, ranked choice deprives voters of an informed choice. Plurality has a long history in Maine and exists for good reason. The best solution isn't an expensive change to the way we vote, it is to vote. It's our responsibility.

Bradley S. Moulton (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
barriers to job training and sufficient efforts to reduce them. As one small step, secondary schools need guidance counselors tracking all students, not just college bound, and ensure completion of certificate and other job training resulting in jobs that pay a livable wage. The Legislature needs to take direction from all stakeholders as to how to achieve results, different than the type of top down approach employed in 2011-12, that is frustrating many school systems just for education.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
use of dedicated funds, such as tobacco settlement funds, is not appropriate, nor is dedicating income tax from a specific income group. It will require taking back income tax cuts for higher income families rather than slashing education and other state programs. No magic pill here, folks.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I studied the social welfare system as a social work major in college, along with two internships, Child Protective Services, Region 1 (Portland) DHS in the 1970's. One of the larger problems currently is the cliff between welfare and employment for people to transition successfully. That should be included in the term quoted in the question along with a whole lot more space than permitted here.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Finally, someone asked the question besides a constituent for whom I promised a bill. As over 33 other states have done, we need to increase the gas tax plus employ a mileage basis for non-gas and hybrid vehicles, and initiate a ""transportation cost fairness credit"" on the Maine income tax form to lessen the regressive tax burden for lower income Mainers.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Lessening of reliance upon fossil fuels and breaking down electric service into more manageable regional units striving to work towards a balanced, or zero, energy consumption should be incorporated in any long-range energy program for the state. That would also include solar and wind, but a whole lot more.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
We need to do a whole lot better raising our children reducing the need for divorce and abortion, especially for children undergoing the trauma of breakdown for too many families. This problem goes way beyond a legislative fix and falls squarely upon our families, communities, and society to address. As a legislator, I reluctantly voted against five of six abortion-related bills because they were defective and would not have directly addressed the individual decisions resulting in abortion.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
My vote is no better or worse than anyone else's for a referendum question brought from outside the legislature, and therefore, not relevant. I do however, find many flaws in funding and operation that I cannot detail in the space provided for the ballot question produced by an agenda-driven special interest organization.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No, as an attorney and voter, I do not believe it would ever comply with the principle of one person, one vote, as found currently in our constitution. All that I see is manipulation and playing games creating an unequal playing field worse than the choices voters must make at the polls without ranked choice voting.

Charles Galemmo (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
What companies are not looking for tax breaks for the wealthiest or deregulation. We have done that and are 36 in the country for economic growth. Business is looking for low property taxes on the parcels they build their stores, factories and other businesses. They are looking for good infrastructure and a workforce with the skills they need. They are looking for communities with good services and schools. They also want middle class people with money to spend at their locations.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The legislature passed a bill that addressed those concerns. The Governor's veto was wrong. Their is plenty of money in our budget. It simply needs to be made a priority.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
It means ensuring low income seniors and children do not go hungry or cold in the winter, that they have access to healthcare and a roof over their heads.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
It would be better to have infrastructure maintenance on a schedule and paid for out of the general fund. We can only borrow for so long and the interest payment is wasted money.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. There are more solar jobs in Massachusetts than coal jobs in the US. Maine has the lowest number of clean energy jobs per capita of any state in New England. Further, renewable energy on the micro-grid is much less expensive than building large generating plants and power lines.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
A women's right to choose is between her, her doctor and those she chooses to confide in. The government should not be involved in this most intimate and challenging of decisions. If we are to reduce the number of abortions we do so by mitigating the economic concerns which are the leading reason women opt for the procedure and improve access to birth control.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I am in favor. Whether the question ultimately passes or fails, we must deal with this issue and make it so seniors can retire in their homes with dignity. Passage of the question will only force the decision.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. First it is the will of the people and government must adhere to that will. Second I believe that after people get accustomed to it third party candidates will have a better chance of winning allowing more varied views in our political discourse.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Better, more adaptive education is the best method to achieve economic development. This includes University, Community College and Trade Schools.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Maine already has a growing rainy day fund that is not being used, which means we have a surplus of tax funding as it is.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Stream lining current programs so that there is less waste, less abuse and tax payers are getting more benefits for the money spent.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes it should. It should probably be a combination of transportation taxes that address the loss of gas taxes. That way the loss or lower of one does not undo the system and none hurt the average person too much.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
I believe in the technologies but until they are more efficient the state should not be subsidizing. The free market should decide.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I think they are correct as is in Maine.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against. It is too much policy in a citizen initiative that should be worked out by lawmakers. The question as is will create as many problems as it claims to solve.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. RCV is the best way to make sure peoples preferred ideals are expressed through out an election. It gives people a piece of mind that they are not throwing away their vote on a Candidate with less of a chance. Maine has amended its constitution 173 times. One more is not as big an issue as people make it out to be.

Christopher W. Babbidge (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Businessowners' concern statewide is the same: workforce, workforce, workforce. More engineers are needed from UMaine and USM. We must help professionals come here and stay here. More public-private partnerships through community colleges can give trainees immediate high-paying jobs. Retiring baby boomers can contribute by sharing their expertise. Many CEOs want to live here, but to open a branch in Maine they need internet connectivity and an educated labor force to make it work.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We already have the money. This investment has a 9-to-1 return. I support a general fund obligation, not dedicated funds. M.E. will cover our most vulnerable working Mainers, help healthcare institutions remain solvent, and protect our healthcare workforce. $500 million in federal money for the Maine economy helps us all. Most states, including those governed by Christie and Kasich, put peoples' needs first. We must do the same, acccepting the 9-1 match as Mainers directed in referendum.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Helping the young, the old, and severely challenged is good for ALL of us. They then pay taxes and buy goods and services. Welfare reform means efficiency and effectiveness to give a hand up, and REPLACING what isn't working with something better. It is NOT irresponsible across-the-board cuts that hurt good and necessary programs, force caregivers to redirect their professional lives elsewhere, and leave our most vulnerable alone to figure it out. We can do this AND be fiscally responsible.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Most transportation dollars come from transportation bonds and the gas tax, the latter a dwindling figure due to the success of federal CAFÉ standards. All of us get better mileage than we used to. Mainers who step up and pay extra for a high mileage vehicle or hybrid car are voluntarily emitting less carbon pollution, and we must not de-incentivize responsible choices. We need to examine taking a bigger piece of Maine Turnpike tolls which are paid in part by out-of-staters.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Renewable energy is good for Maine's air quality, the respiratory and skin health of our children, and new business growth. We should promote incentives permitting lower-income Mainers to also benefit. Community solar should be expanded. The U.S. is in danger of falling behind in the technology race to harness solar and wind, but Maine's solar entrepreneurs and the University of Maine's ocean wind initiative are positioned to be industry leaders if Maine government permits their growth.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
We must improve access to reproductive healthcare for low-income Mainers, and protect the healthcare professionals who serve them. All-male legislatures throughout history have outlawed birth control and abortion. Sex education and birth control are essential for women to decide. No woman should be forced by government to carry an unwanted pregnancy. I fully support a woman with mental, physical or financial health issues who wants to get herself in a better place before becoming a parent.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Sadly true: Social Security deductions are taken only from middle-class levels of income. But this proposal has consequences and opportunity costs that I don't yet know. The new Board may have conflict-of-interest concerns and no real legislative oversight. This 15-page bill has not undergone the scrutiny integral to the legislative process: sponsorship, public hearings, work sessions, committee votes, press coverage with constituent response, floor debate, and final enactment vote.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Majorities have been oppressive & resistant to reform, causing constitutional freedoms to be created. It's bad that a few voters for an extremist 3rd candidate, by their 2nd choice in RCV, can override the plurality winner.But governors should have a mandate as expressed by a majority vote. I will vote for wording that simply requires a majority. Run-off elections are clean and simple, but ranked-choice voting is 2nd best, and is preferable to the status quo in expressing the people's will.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Many Maine students leave to pursue better paying and high tech opportunities in other states. We are not attracting or retaining companies that could create these jobs. Maine must shore up current and start-up businesses by offering tax incentives, providing renewable energy credits, and refurbishing facilities. Students who remain or return should be assisted in paying down student loans. With our expanding senior population, healthcare jobs will grow, so school loan assistance is win/win.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Medicaid expansion benefits hard-working people in low-wage jobs without health insurance. While Gov. LePage refused this, 17 other states with Republican governors (including then Indiana Gov. Mike Pence) approved it. Billions of federal dollars were not taken. Mainers without coverage have no checkups and do not seek help when ill. They use the ER, the most costly treatment. This can be eliminated through expansion. Providing quality healthcare should never be a political battleground.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The term ""welfare reform"" often implies failure and prejudges without knowing the facts about the recipient. Many are mothers of small children, or men and women who may be disabled, or those in low paying jobs, or workers whose skills do not match current needs. Requiring adults who are able-bodied without small children to work, train, or volunteer is appropriate to continue to receive assistance. We must keep our minds open to assist those in genuine need.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Our Governor and legislature often use bonds as a reward/punishment tool. Bonds are an undependable method of infrastructure upkeep. We have borrowed $832 million in this century alone! We must revisit our gas tax, tolls, obtaining Federal dollars, and methods of transportation. Improving rail transport and our ports would further remove traffic from our roads. New construction adds jobs which improve our economy and the quality of our lives and that of our tourists.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The days of dependence on fossil fuels must end. Burning oil is costly and bad for the environment. We must turn to green energy such as wind, solar, and hydro. We should protect our natural resources, our forests, our water quality, our shoreline, and our wildlife before they are further harmed. Providing tax credits to homes, businesses, and farms that go green and weatherize will result it a healthier state. We also must never elect another Governor who denies climate change.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Maine must grant access to abortion free of judgment, restriction, intimidation, and harassment in a safe, comfortable, affordable environment. The decision a woman makes for ending a pregnancy is difficult enough without the intervention of hostile, harmful groups. Funding assistance through Medicaid should not be denied and even be increased to make abortion accessible to all women. We cannot ever return to the days where women were punished and even died seeking unsafe abortions.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
A false assumption is that area elderly are comfortable and require no help. I meet seniors in lovely homes who live alone without help who are house poor. I also see those who are not wealthy who are in dire need. An elderly Wells woman died and her body was not found for 2 years! Universal care would ensure our seniors and disabled have proper assistance, would grow jobs, and help our economy. While it is not perfect, I nevertheless support this program.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Mainers pride themselves on being independent. Many refuse to be identified with a political party. Consequently, we frequently have a three or even four-way split where the person who wins may do so without receiving a majority of the votes. LePage won with 37.6% in 2010 and 48.2% in 2014. Having ranked-choice voting allows for the true majority of voters to designate a winner in excess of 50%. This is a much fairer system and one I would support with ranked-choice voting.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
As long as Maine is in the top 10 in every Tax category ,economic development will lag behind. The Legislature could start by adopting some of NH tax structure. NH has no Income tax or Sales. Property taxes are close for Maine #9 and NH #7 for highest in country.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Reduce the state budget by the exact amount that is needed to fund the expansion.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Reforming welfare means people that really need welfare should not be on a waiting list. And adults with no children and aren't themselves handicap should not receive Welfare.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
No
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Expanding incentives means taking money from one area and putting it in another. I don't want to take money from our most vulnerable just to subsidized millionaires.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Parents should be notified before access to abortion.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
No, Small Business killer! If this passes a lot of people will leave the State and we will be the Number 1 State for Taxation.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. With the primary in June as an example who in they're right mind would want RCV? Took two weeks to determine the winner and now Mr. Dunlap needs more money because of the cost overruns due to the RCV. If elections aren't broken why fix it?

Ryan M. Fecteau (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
A significant portion of the Maine workforce is reaching retirement age. We need to double down our efforts to train and retain our young people. I've sponsored legislation to send a bond to voters that would invest $40 million in our vocational schools. Maine's 27 vocational schools have not received an injection of state resources since a 1998 voter-approved $5 million bond.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The legislature in June of this year approved $60 million in funding for expansion. The figure was based on the LePage Administration's estimate which was higher than independent studies. Even though Gov. LePage continued to say there was no funding to implement expansion, he vetoed the very bill that would fund expansion. It's clear that we need leadership in Augusta that respects the will of voters and implements expansion. There are numerous studies that suggest expansion will pay for itself.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform refers to policy changes that ensure the most vulnerable in our state have access to the safety net that provides them the opportunities to get back on their feet. In addition, there has been a focus on ensuring there are more programs for persons to be trained in sectors that provide more bountiful employment than perhaps what they had prior to falling on hard times.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
This is obviously a very challenging issue since vehicles are becoming more and more fuel efficient; yet, road and highway usage is still significant. In 2013, Virginia passed a reform package regarding how they fund transportation infrastructure that I think is worth exploring. The Federal Highway Administration has offered states technology that charges users based on miles traveled. We definitely need to think outside the box on this issue.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely. We are falling behind many other states that have recognized the economic opportunities that solar and wind generation offer. In fact, we are losing young people to employers in other states that have been provided incentives to grow and implement their technologies. The average median wage in the solar industry, for example, is $26 per hour and a national census reports that 79% of companies do not require a bachelor's degree for new hires.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Any proposal to restrict a woman's right to make her own decisions concerning her reproductive health should be defeated. I strongly believe that individuals should be able to make these decisions in good conscience.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I'll be supporting Question 1. First, I should say that I do not agree with all the mechanics of the proposal and believe the legislature will have an obligation to make adjustments when implementing the law. However, I know that taking care of an elderly family member has a real financial and psychological toll on too many Mainers. We cannot expect Mainers to work full-time and take on the full-time job of caring for elderly family. Not to mention, our seniors deserve dignity as they age.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. Voters have twice approved ranked-choice voting for our elections and the constitution should be amended to reflect this.

Victoria Foley (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
We need to put policies in place that encourage young people to settle in Maine and contribute to our economy. Our education system needs to set students up for success - training today's youth for tomorrow's economy, including the trades and careers that support our aging population.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The members of the House need to work together to find a way to fund the expansion voters have approved.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Social services are necessary to assist our neighbors who are in need, providing people training, support, and a path back to independence. Children and our most vulnerable populations deserve our compassion and caring, which means appropriately funding social service programs.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Funding our roads, bridges, and other infrastructure is imperative to the growth of our economy. We are in a transformative period in transportation and communication, and we have to find better ways to structure the funding. I don't yet have solutions, but I am strongly in favor of acknowledging that improvement is possible, and I am eager to be part of the discussion of new options.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Diversifying the sources of our energy is beneficial for jobs, for the environment, and for our energy security.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Women should be able to make their own healthcare decisions, and make those choices free from harassment and intimidation.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting against Question 1. We need to do all we can to help our elders remain in their homes and age in place. It is not clear that the initiative as written can be implemented in a way that ensures the funds are managed with accountability to the Mainers paying into the system.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Voters have made it clear they support ranked-choice voting, and the Legislature needs to continue to work to clarify how that looks within our state election system.
House District 13: (Map) Old Orchard Beach
Lori K. Gramlich (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
A significant barrier to economic development is the lack of trained and skilled workers in health care and the trade industry. The Legislature can and should provide solutions to advance workforce training for health care workers and trades jobs. Additionally college tuition costs have soared. Providing incentives for reducing costs for college, workforce training and student loan forgiveness are all possible remedies to addressing this issue.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
It is the legislature's responsibility to follow the will of the voter. Many individuals face barriers to the care they need, and businesses are struggling to provide coverage for their employees. Medicaid expansion will provide a 90% match in funding from the Federal Government �"" something other states have done through the ACA, and have already seen the benefits of relative to funding. Additionally, there will be less uncompensated/charity care provided in our state, with expansion.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare has historically been intended to provide safety net supports to get through unforeseen circumstances whether it is a lack of housing, food, clothing, or jobs. Examining current programs built on the achievements of our past provides a basis for determining changes to meet social service needs. Policies using a strengths-based perspective will provide better outcomes for both cost effectiveness and will provide individuals the tools and resources they may need to get back on their feet.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, the state needs to re-examine infrastructure funding. While bonds leverage additional federal funding, we need a funding mix to meet the needs of our state. Obtaining input from experts in the field and examining successes from other states relative to infrastructure funding is a first step. State gas tax rates have not been evaluated for nearly a decade. These rates could be evaluated annually and go back to being indexed to the rate of inflation to accommodate transportation funding.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely. Providing incentives for renewable energy technologies are investments in our future �"" not only are these evolving technologies good for our climate and environment, they are also sound economic development initiatives, in that new jobs are created due to these advancing technologies. We need to shift our reliance from fossil fuels to emerging renewable resources.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Women's decisions regarding her health and health care should be between her and her doctor. I support all women having access to affordable healthcare.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
As Mainers are living longer, more engaged lives, the importance of insuring our residents are able to live out their lives in their own homes is imperative. It is more cost effective for folks to stay in their homes than it is for them to live in facilities. To that end, I support providing home care services, not only for our seniors, but also for other folks with challenges which might otherwise prevent them from living enriched, independent lives and will be voting for Question 1.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
While previous legislatures have been apprehensive of amending our constitution, the people of Maine passed this referendum and the constitution should reflect that. Ranked choice voting is a way to build consensus for a candidate instead of a candidate winning who is not supported by the majority of Maine voters.

House District 14: (Map) Saco (part)
Donna Bailey (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Keeping and attracting workers. Public/private partnerships between local industries, to train workers in those areas that industry leaders identify as future needed skills. Expand our tax incentive programs for those willing to move to and work in areas of the state that are underserved. Tax incentives to businesses that offer programs to pay for workers education, re-training, relocation to the State and/or student loan debt relief. Support the Opportunity Maine Tax Credit Program.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
One of largest parts of any state budge, is the ongoing need for social services to help give a hand up. In addition to dedicating money to the Rainy Day Fund, dedicate a separate fund for social service programs, including MaineCare. The Social Services Fund, like the Rainy Day Fund, should be added to during times the state enjoys a surplus, and would be there when there are insufficient funds, in the General Fund to fully fund the State's share of ongoing needed social service programs.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform means the continuing examination of our social services programs to see where and how we can improve them, both in outcomes and delivery. We also need to insure those that need the help receive it, but those who don't are not allowed to defraud the system. It may also mean eliminating some programs, while adding others, as times change, and needs change. Social service programs, like societies themselves, are not static.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Adequate and predictable funding to maintain our roads and bridges is crucial to our safety, prosperity and economy. Relying on borrowing to fund our infrastructure is passing our responsibility on to future generations. Distance based user fees, with an initial yearly amount exempted for Maine residents; in combination with managed lanes in highly congested areas is the direction we should be exploring. Borrowing should be reserved for more big investment projects.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes Maine should do everything possible to encourage renewable energy technologies. Almost every survey indicates the lack of affordable energy is an impediment to more businesses locating in the State. We need to expand and invest in our renewable fuel and energy alternatives to lower our energy costs, both for homeowners and for businesses. Renewable energy jobs are also a fast growing industry that we should expand and attract more of to the State.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe a woman's right to choose should be respected and maintained. Such a personal decision should be made by a woman in consultation with her doctor, family, friends, and faith, as she chooses. Curtailing access to abortion and reproductive health services does not decrease the numbers of abortions; it only increases the number of unsafe abortions.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting for Question 1. Although I think the funding mechanism in the initiative will need to be re-examined by the Legislature, it is crucial that we look at this crucial issue for our Seniors. It does not make sense that we are willing to spend thousands of dollars to place someone in a nursing home, but we are not willing to spend the same or even less money to provide the needed care for them in their own home.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes I support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative elections, because the voters have been clear that is the system they would like.
Frederick Samp (U)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
We have a demographic problem here in Maine - an aging population without enough younger people moving to or remaining in Maine to support this population. Two recent studies completed under the auspices of several organizations make a number of Legislative recommendations designed to grow the size of Maine's workforce, improve the skills of Maine's workers, improve high speed broadband access and make Maine a leader in health care cost containment, health insurance coverage and public health.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The Legislature approved funding in 2018, but the Governor vetoed the measure out of misplaced concern for long-term funding sources. The potential benefits to Maine of expansion are so overwhelming that State funding should not be a serious concern, and with a new Governor and Legislature, the expansion should be in position to move forward.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The term ""welfare reform"" should be limited to the search for improvements to programs designed to deliver an agreed level of services and to meet stated social goals as efficiently as possible. Many have publicly used the term to describe individual beliefs that the level of services should be increased or decreased or that social goals should change.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
An increasing share of state and federal gas taxes should be dedicated to improving the infrastructure for alternatives more efficient than the private automobile. As the measurement technology develops, it will become necessary to rely more on user fees to fund the maintenance of roads and bridges.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The development of renewable energy technologies will become increasingly important as the public becomes less tolerant of the drawbacks to traditional fossil fuel-based energy sources and as governmental responses to climate change require major technology shifts. As these changes take place, the cost differential between renewable and traditional technologies will likely diminish and the need for incentives will be reduced. Nevertheless, incentive programs will probably still be necessary.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Maine has very few laws that actively restrict abortion access, and I would not advocate further restrictions.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting against Question 1. The underlying legislation is long, complex and covers a number of subjects. It includes three new taxes - a personal payroll tax, a corporate excise tax and an individual income tax. It makes a major change to Maine's labor laws and sets up a complex governance structure. Citizen initiatives do not work well when they cover so many disparate subjects. The question printed on the ballot does not begin to describe the legislation adequately.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I support such a constitutional amendment. The advantages of ranked-choice voting in reducing the need to engage in strategic voting and in elevating the level of political discourse during campaigns are well documented. The experience in recent primary elections in Maine demonstrates that ranked-choice ballots can be simple and easily understood.
Stephen R. DuPuis (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Taxes are the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine. Roll back the top tax rate to between zero and five percent.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
There needs to be a longer term, sustainable funding without increasing taxes and without stealing funds from more needy needs in the State such as School Funding and existing MaineCare programs.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The welfare reform means we need to improve the way we deliver aid to the most needy citizens in our State and make sure that the funds that we do spend are used by the citizens they are intended for and not by those that are capable of working in some capacity.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
There is no easy and quick solution to the infrastructure funding mechanisms. I feel that it is something we need to explore further. I would survey what other States have done to address this problem and see if any of these solutions have potential here in Maine.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
One thing the State of Maine should do is allow Small Wind Energy systems and home solar projects to sell all of there excess power to the grid and not just allow a credit against their usage. This is the case in New Hampshire and allows the economics of renewable power to not only benefit the homeowners but allows the rest of the consumers of the electric grid to benefit from renewable energy.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I don't believe any State funds should go to organizations that perform abortions here in the State.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will voting against Question 1. I believe that this referendum question is illegal. All funding bills must start in the Maine House of Representatives, not in the referendum process. This is a job killer because it would raise the State income tax rate above 10 percent and drive wealthy residents to leave. The only group left to pay the tab, would be the middle class here in Maine.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I would not support a constitutional amendment to allow ranked choice voting here in the State. The current system of plurality works well, is simple and straight forward.
House District 15: (Map) Saco (part)
Margaret O'Neil (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Strengthening our workforce: There are great jobs available now, and employers are struggling to connect with workers to fill those openings. The legislature must continue to partner with Maine employers to tailor our education system to prepare Maine students for jobs that are in demand and will continue to be in demand such as nursing, engineering, and the trades. We must also continue our work to attract newcomers to Maine through student loan credits.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Last year, the governor requested dedicated funding from the legislature and then vetoed that funding once the legislature provided it. This November, Maine voters have the opportunity to elect a governor who will implement Medicaid Expansion. I will be ready to take necessary legislative action to support this effort.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Regardless of party, the governor and legislature should seek to increase efficiency as we work toward our outcomes each year. We have much work ahead to make sure our investments at the state level best serve the people of Maine and to ensure that limited public dollars go to most effectively benefit the least fortunate among us. As for the term ""welfare reform"" itself, it's time to create a new way to discuss efficiency as we support Mainers working to lift themselves out of poverty.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Our state has significant infrastructure needs across all of our regions. The city of Saco is a great example with our longstanding commuter traffic. I am open to new funding methods that will help us invest in the infrastructure that serves us and helps us get where we need to be safely.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
We should absolutely encourage renewable energy technologies in Maine. After missed opportunities in the previous legislature, particularly with solar, the next legislature has no time to waste.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I will not support policies that seek to restrict a woman's access to reproductive healthcare. Such decisions are personal and made between a patient and her medical provider.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
This is a tough issue for me. Seniors and Mainers with disabilities should be able to remain in their homes whenever possible. I speak regularly with constituents who are having a hard time keeping themselves or a loved one in their home due to the cost of care or the time away from work. That said, I won't be supporting question 1. I have concerns with the funding mechanism. The next governor and the legislature must have the political will to address this through the legislative process.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I did not personally vote for Ranked Choice at the ballot box. However, as a legislator, I have supported a constitutional amendment because the people of Maine voted to establish a ranked-choice system, and I heard from many constituents who asked me to support such an amendment. It is my top priority to represent my district in the legislature as I make decisions.
Joseph Lynch (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Governor LePage has set the stage by cutting back regulations and taxes but we need to continue to foster the growing economy.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We cannot just spend money we don't have. As an accountant I understand bills need to get paid.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Stopping the abuse in the system.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I am not a big fan of borrowing but since the cost of construction continues to grow faster than the interest rates we pay it doesn't make sense to put off projects until we have the money.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Too many of these are schemes to pay off politically connected people with tax dollars and have nothing to do with conservation.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
The laws should be restricted. We should provide funding for resources and education to men and women to prevent pregnancies.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against, I think it needs more work before it can be put into action. Unfortunately, I feel it leaves a lot of opportunity for misuse and poor oversight.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No, just look at the primary elections. It is just another ploy to confuse voters who are unfamiliar with the process before voting and took too much time and additional resources to come to a conclusion.

Dave Durrell (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The single biggest barrier right now is population stagnation. We need to work to keep our young people in Maine and to attract more people to the state. Educational diversity for the good job opportunities we have and wage growth are key to those goals.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The legislature proposed several methods of initially funding it, all of which the governor rejected. The funding should ultimately come from the general fund, as part of the DHHS budget. That would have been difficult this year, as the second year of a bi-annual budget, which is why the legislature sought more creative means of funding this past year. The governor was disingenuous in this regard, and he got the House GOP caucus behind him, costing the state hundreds of millions of dollars.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The DHHS aids and protects the most vulnerable of our people, including children and the elderly. We have a moral societal duty to do this, and in the case of children we are also investing in our own future. We obviously want to do this as efficiently and cost effectively as possible, but not by cutting caseworkers or harming people. In terms of general aid, the term is often used negatively. Certainly we should vigorously prosecute welfare fraud but others do really need aid.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I believe the gas tax is still a viable way to fund roads and bridges- most vehicles still do use gas. I do think it needs to be updated, as it hasn't changed in years, even for inflation or reflecting greater mileage efficiency. The gas taxes should be funding more of the bill. Going forward chances are that electric or other energy means will increasingly power our vehicles. As that occurs we need to be reassessing our tax sources to ensure they stay relevant and fair.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes! We let a great opportunity with wind power get away a few years ago, but Maine still has abundant sources of wind, solar and tidal power available. We should be encouraging their development, which ultimately means investment, jobs and dollars in our state.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe that a woman has the right to choose what to do with her own body, and that includes terminating a pregnancy. I do not favor any law restricting this right.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
This addresses an issue of import to all of us- keeping seniors in our homes, which is also a more cost efficient solution than nursing homes. I am concerned about some of the details of this bill, including the funding mechanism and the regulatory body that it sets up. The funding source is the income above the limit taxed for Medicare. However, Congress is not stepping up to address that, so this remains uncaptured revenue. The regulatory issues can be addressed. I am voting yes.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. We did vote for it, so it is the people's will, and it is fair and allows greater choice. Some people are uncomfortable with it because it is ""new"", but as we learn that it works and works well I believe more people will embrace it. We do need to work to make the results quickly known. I believe that is critical to people's acceptance of it.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine needs to formulate a long range economic development strategy. We have high paying jobs available right now that are going unfilled because of the lack of a skilled workforce. This plan might include; job training for displaced and underemployed workers, state policies that attract and support legal immigrants to our state, enhanced career and technical educational offerings, targeted student debt relief and a focus on growing the small businesses central to our economy.
[image id=""2706599"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Maine Taxpayers are already paying for the uninsured. The legislature provided a mechanism to pay the portion that would leverage the 90% due from the Federal Government. All of the data now available seems to prove that states that expanded state Medicaid programs under the ACA, have lower rates of uninsured adults and lower costs overall for health care and insurance premiums for everyone. I believe we will see these benefits once the law is finally implemented.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform means ensuring the social service programs we have in place (food stamps, subsidized housing) are accessible for those who need help and part of a larger program that lifts families out of a life of poverty.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
State and federal gas taxes are insufficient to fund our infrastructure needs. Congress needs to take on this task and until they do, our best option is bonding. As a legislature, we need to work with our congressional delegation in formulating a long range plan to invest in our roads and bridges.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes, I believe renewable energy technologies have the potential to be an extremely viable sector of our economy and incentivizing these businesses helps us all. Renewable energy sources are a necessary part of any plan to address climate change.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I think women deserve to have all options available to them when deciding issues around their bodies and their health.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
While I agree that we need to do more to help seniors remain in their homes, I do not see Question 1 as the answer. Before we put in place a completely new framework and funding model for home care delivery services, we would be better served by properly evaluating and funding the agencies already in place. When the legislature does not do its job, you see questions like this appear on the ballot.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. I think the voters have been clear in their support for ranked choice voting and I respect that vote.
Pamela Buck (R)

House District 19: (Map) Sanford (part)
Matthew A. Harrington (R) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
There are a couple of barriers to economic development in Maine. We need to lower electricity costs, lower healthcare costs, reduce taxes, and address our labor shortage. We must embrace CTE and vocational education programs, and partner with our school systems through apprenticeship programs to ensure that students can be placed in employment situations. We also need to focus on growing our population, and recruiting people to raise live, work, and raise their families in our great state.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Voters passed the law and it is our responsibility as the Legislature to appropriate the funds. We need all stakeholders to gather around the table to talk about a responsible and sustainable funding mechanism for Medicaid expansion that does not include raising taxes, cutting funding for education, or raiding Maine's rainy day fund. We need a long-term funding solution so we do not end up with massive debts owed to Maine hospitals that resulted from the last expansion.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform means maintaining a strong safety net for our most vulnerable citizens including our elderly, disabled, children, and veterans. Welfare should be a hand up for those who have hit a bump in the road, not a permanent hand out. We must continue to require individuals who can work - to work, volunteer, or participate in training to acquire skills to get a job. We must make sure welfare dollars are not spent on gambling, cigarettes, alcohol, or other illicit activities.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Bonding can be an effective way to improve our infrastructure. However, it cannot be the only way we fund it. We must develop a long-term, strategic plan, to address our infrastructure shortfalls. In addition, we must also prioritize infrastructure in our state budget by cutting out the waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars. We need to identify redundancies in our state budget and work to eliminate them, ensuring tax dollars are spent as efficiently and effectively as possible.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Maine needs a comprehensive energy strategy. We need to stop picking winners and losers and embrace a wide range of energy technologies. If we want to continue to grow our economy, we must lower electricity costs. I support renewable energy technologies that lower costs, and protect our environment. I do not support broad-based government subsidies for technologies that are not commercially viable, and only increase costs for Maine families and small businesses.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro-life. However, Roe v. Wade is the law of the land and we all have to live under it. I support abortion being a choice in instances of rape, incest, and the life of the mother. I oppose the use of taxpayer money for abortions, and support common-sense measures like parental notification for minors. As science develops with regards to the viability of the fetus, we must continually assess our abortion laws and restrictions to ensure that we are protecting the sanctity of life.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I am adamantly opposed to Question 1. Many of our existing home-care workers don't event support this extreme initiative. We need to protect our senior and disabled citizens. However, we cannot continue to grow Maine's economy by dramatically increasing taxes. Outside billionaires cannot continue to come into Maine and pour money into these liberal referendum questions, and use Maine as their test site. We need referendum reform to ensure all Mainers are adequately represented.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. Ranked-choice voting is both expensive and confusing. These last primary election results show that the result under ranked-choice voting would not have been any different than using a plurality of the vote. Ranked-choice voting has serious constitutional implications, and is largely unsupported by our hardworking town clerks who are responsible for administering our elections.
Jeremy Mele (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
A lack of a protected workforce. Maine unemployment is down, yet we have a so many jobs that go unfilled. This is due to a lack of incentives for workers to come to Maine. We need to attract workers to Maine in order to fill jobs and spur economic development. The legislature can do that by working to guarantee healthcare for all, establishing a student loan forgiveness program to attract college graduates, and upholding the gains we have made for the minimum wage.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
I was disappointed when the governor vetoed the bipartisan funding bill for the Medicaid expansion. To my mind, using Funds for a Healthy Maine and a small portion of the surplus just made sense when we had a surplus of $175 million. Healthcare is a human right, and the legislature needs to guarantee that right for Mainers. I support the aforementioned funding pathway because working and low income Mainers are dying due to lack of healthcare, and the legislature needs to combat this.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
""Welfare reform"" is often code for ""ignoring the needs of the most vulnerable"". I don't think we should be in the practice of gutting important and necessary social services. Doing so would leave thousands of working Mainers without vital support systems. Instead of ""reforming"" welfare, we should be expanding social programs, like Medicare, to cover everyone.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Providing safe and efficient infrastructure is one of the most important jobs of the government. We need safe roads and bridges for the day to day operations of society, and it will be my priority to make sure that funding for such infrastructure is secured. Bonding should be an option for funding large-scale projects, but we also need to explore how other states have begun to fund infrastructure upkeep, learn from them, and apply best practices in our communities.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Climate change is real, it's happening now, and if we do not divest from fossil fuels and transition to clean energy in a prompt manner, we risk ecological destruction. That sounds apocalyptic, but we have seen the dangers of climate change from increased tropical storms just recently with Florence in North Carolina. If we don't incentivize the transition to clean energy, our coastal communities will be at serious risk from rising ocean levels and storms.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe that people have the right to autonomy over their own bodies. A man should not be making decisions over what a woman should or should not do with her body, and neither should the state be in the business of infringing on the bodily autonomy of its citizens. Abortion is an important part of healthcare for so many, and, in order to protect the health and autonomy of Maine women, I do not think the state should be restricting access to it.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
For. We all get old, and many of us become disabled. When we do, we deserve to receive the care we need, and we deserve to receive that care in a way that lets us stay in the homes we've worked hard to own. Question 1 will ensure that the elderly and the disabled, many of whom are veterans, can receive the care they need while lifting a financial burden off of working Mainers who might otherwise struggle to afford and/or find time out of their work schedules to care for their relatives in need.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I am supportive of Ranked-Choice Voting in general; I think it provides Mainers a more accurate way of voicing our opinion of who we think should represent us in the government. In this way, it is a boon to, and a refinement of, our democratic process. Furthermore, the voters of my district approved Ranked-Choice Voting in 2016 and again during this year's midterm. A representative needs to represent the will of the voters of their district.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The legislature needs fiscal responsibility. The tax burden on businesses are deterrents to new businesses coming to Maine. We need an energy plan to ensure viable, sustainable, affordable and reliable energy. Burdensome business regulations need to be relaxed. High Speed Internet throughout the state is a must. Education, K-12, CTE, Community College and University systems need to be streamlined and strengthened. We need to explore capital incentives for college students to stay in Maine.
[image id=""2708667"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Without a constitutional amendment requiring referendum bills to go to the Appropriations committee, the entire system is upside down. In order to fund this expansion, we must have a long-term sustainable funding source. I do not support raising taxes, using the state's rainy-day fund or spending gimmicks.
These able bodied, childless adults who will benefit, should have skin in the game; contributing to their own healthcare cost. If not, the health care costs will continue to rise.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare was intended to help those in need get back on their feet again, a hand-up, not a hand out. It was never intended to be a lifestyle. The 'T' in TANF stands for TEMPORARY. When people need help, this system is in place and designed to be a safety net. It was also intended to help those who are genuinely and permanently unable to care for themselves. Anything that falls outside of this should be subject to re-examination and should be re-tooled or reformed.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Constant borrowing is a problem and sets up our next generation to pick up the tab. We should revisit the means by which we fund our infrastructure.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Maine's energy exportation wholesale prices have been stable for years, however our price of transmission has increase 250% during the period. We should also continue the course of maintaining one of the nationally top cleanest energy producers.
Hidden fees raising the electric bills of all rate payers including low income and elderly Mainers is not acceptable. If people want solar panels on their house they're free to do so. State government should not force their neighbors to pay for it.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am not in favor of loosening access. Public funds should not be used for abortion access.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
No to Q1. Why was this bill denied a public hearing? What is being hidden?
The shadow-government board this bill proposes, will allow funds to flow through a publicly funded, unaccountable 9-person private, union-backed board, who will determine the spending of $300 million annual funds. Additionally, this board will have $15 million to spend on themselves. SERIOUSLY? The private information of individual state home care providers will be accessed without consent. This is unacceptable.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No, I do not support this. Ironically, the proponents of RCV seek a constitutional amendment. Yet they oppose a constitutional amendment requiring equal number of signatures from the First and Second Congressional District to allow a question to be on the ballot. Fixing the referendum process must come first. RCV cost this state an additional $300,000 above the costly projected budget. These schemes always cost more than projected. This is a highly irresponsible abuse of public funds.
Justin Reinhardt (G)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The biggest barrier is that the jobs dont pay what the cost of living here is. We need a workforce and the issue is quite simply no one can afford to work here.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
It's funny to me that no one asked this question when general dynamics was given a 45 million dollar tax break and fired 26 people afterwards. Id say walk back the tax breaks starting from there. 45 million buys a lot of healthcare.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Theft of the insurances we the public pay for, so that the oligarchs can get a bigger tax break on their private jets.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Absolutely. A publicly owned infrastructure program to include water power gas and broadband with a state run single payer healthcare system would be a good way to start. Lots of jobs investing in ourselves as opposed to letting private industry take control of our resources.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely becoming clean energy independent even as a state should always be a priority.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro choice, I wouldn't want someone making a decision for me and I would assume the same respect to anyone else.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
In favor of. Im a big fan of treating people with dignity and respect, in home care offers that to elderly mainers who mat have issues getting care they need.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Absolutely. The people have spoken and it is morally reprehensible that the legislature cant seem to honor the will of the people.
Kelcy McNamara (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The barriers to economic development differ for large and small businesses in Maine. A lack of workers is affecting businesses of all sizes. With our natural beauty and quality of life Maine is well positioned to attract an increasingly mobile workforce. We should be focused on building excellent public schools, reliable statewide broadband internet, and a state government that is effective, cooperative, and respectful of each other and its constituents.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The people of Maine, the state legislature, and Maine courts have all made it clear the Medicaid expansion is law and will be implemented. The funding is available, the long-term cost savings are clear, and it is the responsibility of the next Legislature and Governor to implement the roll-out without devolving into partisan fights and government shutdowns.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform priorities differ for Democrats and Republicans but share some of the same goals. Policies meant to help those in economic need should be both evidenced based and have the long-term interests of the state and it's economy in mind.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Low interest rates have made larger, much-needed investments in our infrastructure possible, but they are not long terms strategies. As cars become more fuel efficient and account for a decreasing amount of fuel tax, we need to consider new ways to fund our infrastructure that are both fair and cost effective.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The renewable energy sector is one of the fastest growing in the country and Maine. It is responsible for thousands of good paying jobs that cannot be exported. Renewable energy could become a critical new foundational economy for Maine that would have huge benefits for rural and suburban communities across the state. We should stop throwing up borders to renewable energy and should support it with reasonable, short-term investments which studies show offer excellent long-term returns.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe in a woman's right to choose and support policies that allow them to do so in a safe and healthy manner.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I believe we should do all we can to support seniors who want to age in place--their place--with dignity. I support and will work hard to accomplish the goal of Question 1 but am generally not for aggressive tax policy by referendum. In fact I think this highlights the importance of implementing the voter-approved Medicaid expansion.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Ranked Choice Voting achieves the same fair result that run-off elections used all over the country accomplish. But it does so in a more cost effective and timely way. If our governor and legislature were all elected by a majority, I think we would see far more civility and a lot more getting done in Augusta.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The state needs to provide the infrastructure that makes business work and the education that makes for a ready workforce. Broadband is essential for both business and education, making it an important part of needed infrastructure improvement.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Every dollar Maine spends on Medicaid expansion will be matched with $9 from the federal government, $9 that will be spent in Maine paying salaries and fees for services rendered in Maine, and re-spent by the medical staffs and businesses who receive the salaries and fees. If Maine can't recoup the investment through revenues generated by the infusion of money into the local economy, the state is doing something wrong.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I believe there is a mistaken perception that there is an epidemic of professional welfare recipients. Despite a unemployment rate under 3%, nearly a third of Mainers don't make enough to meet monthly bills. Welfare recipients aren't generally able-bodied individuals who refuse to work, they are under-employed or under-paid workers. We need welfare not because people are lazy but because capitalists are greedy and exploit workers such that a job often doesn't provide enough income to get by.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
No.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The state should not subsidize private industry, but should take part in developing clean energy technologies for Maine and reducing Mainers' dependence upon fossil fuels.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
No.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting ""yes"" on Question 1 because I believe we should help seniors live in their homes for as long as they want, both for the happiness of the people and because in-home care is generally less expensive than alternatives.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I support Ranked Choice Voting because it has the potential to reduce the domination of the two-party system and because the results will be more reflective of what a majority of the people want.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The biggest barrier to economic development in Maine is the lack of enough trained workers in specific fields like health care and skilled trades. The Legislature can encourage and should provide incentives for reducing costs for college/workforce training and student loan forgiveness.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Full implementation and funding Medicaid expansion will be a top priority of mine. The Legislature and next administration need to honor the will of the voters.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare should be a program to help people get through unforeseen circumstances whether it is a lack of housing, food, clothing, or a job. Current programs should be evaluated to see if and where changes could/need to be made. We need to work with welfare recipients so they can get back on their feet whether that means providing education/job retraining, child care services, health care, or food/shelter.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes. This needs to be done with input from experts in the field and look at what other states have done to change their infrastructure funding. The state gas tax has not been increased since 2011 and a modest increase could be part of the overall plan. State gas tax rates should be evaluated annually and go back to being indexed to the rate of inflation. There are many electric and hybrid cars on our roads now and there should be a way to access a road usage fee for them.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes, incentives for renewable energy technologies should be expanded. We need to rely less on fossil fuel based technologies because of the impact on our climate and environment.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Women's health decisions should be between a woman and her doctor. All women need appropriate access to healthcare regardless of income and geographic location
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Although Maine needs to do a better job at supporting senior citizens in their homes and it is significantly cheaper to help them in their homes instead of placing them in facilities, I am concerned about making tax policies via referendum. I will be voting against Question 1.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. The people of Maine passed the referendum and the constitution should reflect that. Ranked choice voting is a way to build consensus for a candidate instead of a candidate winning who is not supported by the majority of Maine voters.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The biggest barrier to economic development in our state is not one issue, but instead the way we govern. Instead of thinking in two-year increments, we need to think long-range, and develop economic plans that look ten, twenty, and thirty years out. For too long the legislature has taken a spitball approach to economic development. We need to develop long term policies that integrate all areas of our economy into a plan to sustainably grow our economy.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Maine voters overwhelmingly approved Medicaid expansion, and we owe it to the 70,000 Mainers who would benefit to immediately implement the new law. Depending on the federal government match, we should incorporate any necessary funding into the state budget. It may come at a cost to other programs, but any increase in funding should be done through the budget process.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Social service programs are a critical lifeline for many Mainers; however, there are reforms we can undertake to make the system work even better. Unfortunately, these reforms have been hindered by those who have turned reform into a political issue. Good people on both sides should come together to work on the reforms that will promote work, encourage individual responsibility, and ensure that those among us who need help are able to get that help.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Every year, the DOT says we need $160 million more to keep up with basic maintenance. This is unacceptable. If there's anything government is responsible for, it's to ensure Maine people and businesses have safe roads and bridges. During my six years in the Legislature, I have submitted bipartisan bills to try and solve this issue. While bonds play a role in funding infrastructure, we must identify sustainable, predictable funding that doesn't rely on borrowing to ensure the system's longevity.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. While we must still invest in traditional sources of energy, such as natural gas, we must begin investing in clean renewable energies. Not only is it good for our air and water, it also creates good paying jobs. From research and development to construction, a clean renewable energy sector could yield thousands of new jobs, particularly in areas of Maine that are in need of new jobs.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
The issue of abortion is a difficult one for many people; however, it is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution, and should remain so. The only people making decisions about this procedure should be a woman and her doctor and, in that light, we should be enacting legislation to ensure that any woman who elects to have an abortion is doing so fully-informed and in a safe facility. We do not need laws that make it harder for women to have an abortion.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
The goal of ensuring that our elderly get the care they deserve is an important one. However, I believe that tax policy should generally be set by the legislature because it provides an opportunity to amend bills before they get enacted into law. The best tax legislation gets written when many people have the opportunity to have input, and that is not the case with this referendum. The legislature should take up this important issue when it returns in January.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. Maine people twice voted to support ranked choice voting, even after the legislature voted to repeal the law. Genuine questions of constitutionality arose during the campaign; however voters chose to enact-and then keep-this new way of voting. We should ensure that the system for which they voted gets used in the gubernatorial and state legislative races. The legislature should send a constitutional amendment out to the people for ratification.
Roger E. Densmore III (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
High taxes...however, within the last several years, Maine has seen a slight decrease in the income tax. At the same time, Maine has been experiencing some of the lowest unemployment rates in years. The flip side to this is, is businesses have been unable to find and hire capable/skilled employees. There are many Maine businesses that are losing out on millions of dollar's worth of new work because they are unable to hire workers who are skilled in the appropriate trades.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
My understanding is that normally bills passed by the legislature send funding requests to the appropriations committee to see how it fits into the budget. When the Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion, it was done without a long-term, sustainable funding source that does not raise taxes or deplete Maine's rainy-day fund. It took the Governor many years to pay back the hospitals and get Maine out of the debt from the last Medicaid expansion, we must learn from this history.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare Reform to me should be an ongoing effort. We should make sure those who need the social service programs have full access to them while those who are using them as a manner of convenience do not. Those who are able to work and choose not to are just taking away valuable resources from those in need while taking hardworking tax dollars. Numerous welfare reform proposals have been submitted by Republicans and rejected by Democrats on how individuals can use the money ie alcohol, tobacco
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I feel if the revenue generated by each towns vehicle registration excise tax was used the way it was intended, rather that put into a general fund used to fund other shortfalls in the towns budgets, along with toll revenue, there would be plenty of funding for Maine roads and bridges. If there continued to be revenue shortfalls for what was needed, I'd prefer an increase in tolls at he border so visitors to the State would fund a majority of infrastructure/transportation repairs.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
We should not be subsidizing any energy resources or any renewal technologies, if it means raising electric bills or taxes on Maine residents to fund it.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro-life. I believe in the sanctity of human life, from conception to natural death. I support prohibiting the use of state funds for abortion or activities that run counter to the sanctity of human life.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting no on Question 1, as it will impose massive tax increases on already overtaxed Maine families and businesses. It will undermine programs for the poor and funding would be open to everyone, regardless of income. The referendum process has been hijacked by out of state money that does not have Mainers best interest in mind. The unelected and unaccountable committee will have upwards of 300 million dollars worth of taxpayers money to do whatever they want with.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I do not support amending the constitution to allow ranked-choice voting. I believe in 1 person, 1 vote. Ranked-choice voting is not only a waste of time, it is a waste of tax payer's money. We should be focused on ways to improve the referendum process.

Karen Vachon (R) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Workforce shortages because baby boomers retiring, people dying of drug overdose, high taxes and high energy prices. We need to get our young people suffering from addiction into treatment. We need to incentivize young talented people to settle in Maine; with an emphasis on bringing Maine bred children who left the state �"" back to Maine. At the same time, promote a proud Maine brand that young children growing up here, never want to leave.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
First �"" no question should be allowed to go to citizen referendum without a price tag and a method to pay for it. People don't like to go to restaurants that don't put the price on the menu; citizen referendums should not be absent a price tag either. Second �"" healthcare is very complex, and is something every Mainer needs. A two-sentence referendum question with no price tag is a completely irresponsible way to introduce healthcare policy.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We must provide safety nets for our most needy, debilitated, intellectually challenged people who cannot care for themselves. Welfare should not be a way of life. People falling on hard times, should be extended temporary assistance with a hand up; rather than forever reliant on a hand out. Welfare programs should incorporate work, volunteer, or continuing education elements, with an emphasis that supports community engagement, self-sufficiency, productivity, and financial independence.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Our roads and bridges are crumbling. All vehicles who use the roads, should pay. Increasing the gas tax and usage fees for electric vehicles are ways to increase revenue.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
No. Already, Maine produces 40% more energy than it uses. I don't support subsidies. There is an appetite for renewable energy by consumers �"" we should let the free market invest in this technology in a fair and sustainable way. Renewable energy needs to compete and stand on its own merit. Maine should put pressure on Massachusetts to expand the pipelines for low cost natural gas. Maine should not expand wind to benefit Massachusetts.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. It's ironic that PITA wanted to erect a monument to honor the death of a truck load of lobsters. It's ironic that we go to great lengths to protect our piping plover population. But we don't protect the life of an unborn human being. In our efforts to protect our environment, why aren't we protecting the highest form of life: human life? There's a disconnect.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
No. A 3.8% increase in income tax to people earning $128,400/year is a bad idea. It will send high wage earners out of state; it will deter high wage earners from moving to Maine. It will attract more aging seniors to our state. The US Department of Health & Human Services estimates that 70% of seniors over age 65 will need long term care services. The revenue raised from this tax, will no be enough to provide the care it promises. Addressing healthcare and opioid epidemic take priority.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. I support the current plurality voting system. It is clear and easy for everyone to understand and participate: the person with the most votes wins. Why over complicate voting? It confuses the voter, costs more, and takes longer to determine the results.
Shawn A. Babine (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
POVERTY! For the last eight years we've been living through a war on poor people, when we should be waging war on the issues that cause poverty. Increased funding for education, Medicaid expansion and improved access to healthcare, investments in workforce planning and skilled training programs - those are the fights worth fighting for. Education is the ladder that helps every Mainer out of poverty.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
There wasn't a lack of funding - the Maine Legislature identified a funding source. Medicaid expansion didn't happen because of a lack of respect for the Maine people by the LePage administration and a lack of leadership from the House republicans.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The fact is general assistance (e.g. welfare) is needed for very diverse reasons while """"welfare reform"""" is a goal of reducing the number of individuals dependent on government assistance; hopefully by keeping the welfare system affordable and by providing resources that give each recipient the opportunity to become self sufficient. It's time we stop the current war on poor people and start finding solutions on what causes poverty.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
This is a complex issue that I am not familiar with yet and would need more information in order to provide a specific response.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Most renewable energy investments are spent on materials and workmanship to build and maintain the facilities, rather than on costly energy imports. Renewable energy investments are spent within the same state, and often in the same town. This means our energy dollars stay home to create high paying skilled jobs (jobs that a new generation of highly skilled young workers are leaving our state for) and fuel local economies, rather than going overseas.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
A woman has the right to an abortion, and no government, law or person should interfere with her exercising her rights.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I believe how a citizen votes in the ballot box is private and personal even if they are a legislator. I will share I am somewhat undecided. I believe the intent of the citizen initiative is admirable and with the failure of the legislature to override the Governor's veto of medicaid expansion further supports why this is so needed. I am concerned about creating another dysfunctional oversight agency within DHHS, when the solution is universal healthcare and medicare for all.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
As a Legislator I would support a constitutional amendment; Maine voters have been very clear - they want ranked-choice voting.
House District 30: (Map) Cape Elizabeth (part)
Anne M. Carney (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine has strong economic potential, but we're limited by workforce and skilled labor shortages. The Legislature can encourage business growth by adequately funding the technical and community colleges that train Mainers and build the workforce our economy needs. Our agriculture and forestry industries would similarly benefit from additional resources being directed toward U Maine, to support research centers and educational programs that bring growth and innovation to Maine's economy.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Let's put the question into perspective. Mainers' federal taxes currently fund Medicaid expansion in 32 other states. With expansion, Maine will see over $500 million in federal funds per year, and the creation of over 5,000 health care jobs. Maine can initially fund our 10% share of the program from the Fund for a Healthy Maine. Thereafter, the Legislature will fund expansion using the normal appropriations process. We only pay 10% to receive $500 million annually, so I consider it a priority.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I don't like to use the term ""welfare reform;"" it's stigmatizing toward people who participate in publicly-funded programs. Additionally, each of these programs stands on its own two feet, and should be evaluated according to the benefits it provides. If a program doesn't achieve its intended purpose, the Legislature should improve it - but I don't consider that ""welfare reform."" I consider it good governance and smart use of tax dollars.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Maine should rethink how we fund transportation. We all benefit from the transportation infrastructure, but gas tax is most burdensome to people in rural communities. And the system isn't sustainable - as we improve fuel efficiency to protect the environment, the money available for infrastructure dwindles. Maine should consider combining the current fuel-based system with a per-vehicle tax based on value. This both increases funding and more fairly balances the cost of maintaining our roads.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Keeping current incentives, like net metering, is fair to homeowners and businesses that have already invested in renewable energy. By modernizing our laws to allow larger cost-effective community solar projects, we can save Mainers money while protecting the environment. These incentives don't impact the state budget, and growing Maine's renewable energy sector creates jobs all over the state. We should spend our energy dollars in Maine, on Mainers, rather than send that money out of state.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Americans have a constitutional right to safe, legal abortion care - but this right is not accessible to all. A person's ability to obtain an abortion often depends on factors like where they live and their financial resources. I support laws that help Mainers overcome these barriers, and oppose laws that create new ones. For example, I would support amending Maine law to allow licensed and qualified physician assistants and advanced practice registered nurses to provide medication abortion.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
After much research and thought, I'll vote against Question 1. It provides benefits to people who can afford to pay for home-care themselves. Meanwhile, Mainers in need could be denied benefits if funds are used up. And Question 1 double-taxes some families, because the 3.8% is based on family income while social security tax applies to individual income. Question 1 is really nine pages of complex changes to Maine's Health and Tax laws that, to me, don't add up to an effective benefit program.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. Maine voters have twice spoken loudly on this issue, and it is clear that they want ranked-choice voting. As a legislator, my role would be to represent my constituents' interests, and I strongly support a constitutional amendment to allow ranked-choice voting in Maine's general elections.

Lois Galgay Reckitt (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Workforce shortages and the necessity for specialized training. Training initiatives are particularly important for people emigrating to Maine whose credentials may not be entirely compatible without changes in current requirements or updates through training.
In addition, workers laid off from Maine's Forest Products Industries may need similar training and updates to adapt to different job opportunities. The Community College System should be leading the way on this issue.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We need a new Governor who will not repeatedly stymie both Legislative and citizen efforts in this area.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Providing family supports, child care initiatives, education and training opportunities could eliminate the subsidies currently required by many in Maine. Those are some of the ""welfare reforms"" that are needed.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
For one thing, we need to put the bonds that have already been approved on the market! But further, we need a graduated, strategic and comprehensive plan for all aspects of our declining infrastructure...and get to it. And that plan needs to be done in a statewide and comprehensive way.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely, the future of both Maine and the planet depend on it.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Public and insurance based funding should be available for all who choose to make this difficult decision.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I am not yet sure. I understand the necessity of home based care as well as the need for public/governmental subsidies. However, the devil is in the details and I have not yet studied them. I am however sure that if the Question passes, the Legislature may well change/try to fix it if they feel that needs to happen.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Absolutely. I have supported the process even before it was an issue in Maine. I have run elections with 3000+ participants in the national nonprofit sector and have watched it both work to give all participants a meaningful voice - and decrease rancor.

Christopher Kessler (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Our economic system has created an environment where the cost of health care, housing and education has risen out of control. Relieving the cost burden of these needs will free up resources to be spent on expanding and strengthening our economy. This requires a fairer tax system that requires the wealthy to contribute more.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
There is funding from the recent tobacco settlement fund to pay for the initial outlay, and then should come from the General Fund afterward.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
""Welfare Reform"" to me is a term used by people that wish to cut benefits and services from those who need them. To me, it is a loaded phrase that implies that there is something wrong with our welfare system.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I do not believe a gas tax is an outdated way of funding transportation.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely. It is a matter of economic and energy security: Maine is the most oil-dependent state in the nation. We must also do our part to lessen the impact of human activity on the climate.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
No.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I am voting for Question 1. The initiative addresses one of the most pressing needs in our society: providing basic care to our elders in the oldest state in the nation. Paying for this care is out of reach for many families. A 3.8% tax on individual income above $128,400 is reasonable, in my opinion. I see it as a step toward eventually providing universal health care to all Maine residents.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Absolutely. Ranked-choice voting is a better way to do elections, eliminating ""spoiler candidates"" and truly having an accurate pulse on the sentiment of the voters. It has been proven to work worldwide and has shown to work well in Maine thus far.

Victoria Morales (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine lacks vision and planning. As one of the oldest states with our young people leaving for opportunities in other states, we need strong leadership to change that narrative. I will work with the private, public, and nonprofit sectors to invest in workforce training, public pre-k and schools, student loan relief, and to support small businesses. As a parent of three children, ages 8, 12, and 14, and a small business owner, this issue is extremely important to me.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Yes, funding concerns should be addressed, however the program comes almost fully funded. The Medicaid expansion program offers Maine the opportunity to provide health care to 70,000 low income Mainers at only 10% of the cost of the program. This means for every dollar spent, the federal government pays 90 cents. This is an incredible financial investment considering the benefits to Maine people and the economy, including a healthier workforce and new health care jobs.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The term welfare reform unfairly paints folks in need of this temporary safety net as lazy. I was fortunate to have a family safety net to help with my college tuition. But for so many, these family safety nets do not exist. Consistent with my belief that government's role is to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of its people, providing people temporary support to make a better life for themselves and their children is not only the right thing to do, it is also good for our economy.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, as a former MeDOT employee, I am intimately aware of the challenges to maintain and keep safe our over 8,000 miles of roads and bridges. We fund projects with vehicle fees and taxes, federal funds, and bonds. Bonds leverage federal funds and spread the infrastructure cost over many generations. As the demand for alternative fuel vehicles and transit increases, I am interested in exploring user fees and other sources to fund infrastructure improvements.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes, Maine should expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technology. Once the political will is favorable and we have a renewable energy policy, I am optimistic that we will see an influx of new projects and jobs in this area, as well as partnerships with the private sector to expand services such as broadband to rural Maine along with each new project. Furthermore, adding more competition into the energy and utility sector will create a healthier and more balanced market.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe that medical decisions should be made by women and their medical professionals. The global data on this issue is clear. For countries that remove barriers to contraception and abortion, the abortion rates drop significantly. For countries that restrict access, abortion rates rise. For these reasons, I support loosening restrictions to contraception and abortion.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
The wording of the ballot question indicates that the 3.8% income tax increase to support the home care program will apply to individuals and families meeting the income threshold. While I support the intent behind the referendum, I am very concerned about funding the program with a tax increase on middle class families. If this initiative does not pass, I am interested in keeping this discussion going to find other funding solutions to the home care problems.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. I support RCV because it is an efficient election process that allows for more voices to be heard. Moreover, RCV reduces the need for costly run-off elections and candidates being elected with less than 50% of the vote. Maine voters have expressed strong support for RCV and the legislature should move forward with a constitutional amendment.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Infrastructure including the electrical grid ( 3 phase power) and high speed internet.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Funding has been identified by the democratic legislators but blocked by the Executive.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
S**ew you, Jack! I've got mine!
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Sooner rather than later! Vehicle Miles Traveled is one option that brings us back to the philosophy that ""user fees"" paid by ""users"" should pay for upkeep!
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. It's going to happen inevitably so we would be wise to be ahead of the curve!
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Laws around abortion access should be left the heck alone!
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Sad to say, against. I've been a caregiver so I really do understand the need, I just don't think this solution has been well thought out.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes! Here we go again this year with the risk of having good candidates turned into spoilers.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The biggest barrier to economic development in Maine is our failure to provide appropriate education and training in the knowledge and skills that entrepreneurs need to grow small businesses and that employees need to obtain good jobs. The Legislature would do well to expand workforce training programs, especially those aimed at recipients of social services, and increase free and low-cost online learning programs through the University of Maine System and regional vocational schools.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Since Maine citizens approved Medicaid expansion the Legislature must implement the voters' will and provide funding through the general budget. A first source of funding would be any savings that can be achieved by streamlining other state programs. If necessary, additional tax revenue could be raised from the wealthiest residents of the state. The state should limit Medicaid expenditures by working to improve economic conditions to help citizens afford to pay for their own health care.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We need to reform social service programs so that they are successful in transitioning most people off of dependence on state assistance, rather than serving as a permanent source of income, housing and food, as they are for many people. There are some members of society who, because of mental illness or other disability, require public assistance on a permanent basis, but many more would be well served by programs that require them to work in exchange for the public benefits that they receive.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Maine should become a leader in the nation and world by implementing significant carbon taxes which would create incentives for reducing carbon emissions and changing people's behavior. Roads and bridges should be paid for primarily through state and federal taxes on the gasoline used to power the vehicles that use them. Rather than pay more interest on transportation bonds Maine would do well to increase investment on infrastructure in the general budget.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The state should expand incentives to encourage appropriate renewable energy technologies, especially solar power. Because solar power does not generate carbon dioxide emissions or other air pollution, it has fewer negative externalities -- costs passed on to society and the environment -- than burning of fossil fuels. Most importantly, the state should invest in energy conservation programs and education, and we should learn to change our habits and consume far less energy than we do now.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
The life of a girl with distinct genes from her mother begins when a sperm cell fertilizes an egg and her gender is determined. A boy's heartbeat can be detected within seven weeks of development within his mother's womb. A fetus is not a part of a woman's body, it is a unique human being inside a woman's body. I support mandatory sonograms and 24-hour waiting periods for women seeking abortions in the hope that these requirements will help them decide not to end their children's lives.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will vote against Question 1 because this type of decision should be made by the Legislature, not through a referendum. 3.8 percent of the income of a large number of Maine residents is too great a portion of revenue to be specifically earmarked for the single purpose of home care. Households with a combined income of over $128,400 are not necessarily wealthy enough to afford this much additional taxation if they include two wage earners with children.

8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I support a constitutional amendment allowing ranked choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections because it would enable citizens to vote for the candidate they most support without fearing that they would be inadvertently helping the candidate they most oppose. Ranked choice voting would help candidates from outside the two major parties win election to public office as many independent and third-party candidates would be the second choice of Democrats and Republicans.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The biggest barrier is the inability for regular Mainers to have access to the startup capital and expertise to start and maintain new, small business. The Legislature can implement the strategy recommendations proposed last year to the Committee on Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The funding in the short term already exists. It also exists in the long term if we chose to make healthcare for Mainers a priority.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Usually, Welfare Reform means denying help to someone trying to get it to make short term political gains. True Welfare Reform would focus on long-term goals of truly moving people back into the work force and not merely claiming victory when we send them off to fend for themselves and the rolls shrink as a result.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes. Infrastructure is a necessity for the success of the state. Like so many things, we leave improvements to municipalities or to another day. We need to improve our ability to move people and products In energy efficient ways.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. We could be the producers of this technology but instead we coddle the fossil fuel industry to maintain the status quo. We could be leaders in these industries but we choose to bicker about whether to follow.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am satisfied with the laws as they exist.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Workers in the home are industry can not afford to hold these jobs. As question 1 will give them a raise, create entry level jobs statewide and take care of the elderly, I will vote for it.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. I'm pretty sure the people have spoken twice on this. I don't believe that I am smarter then the voters.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
By far the most important economic development issue facing Maine is the aging population, which is starting (and will continue) to have a profound effect on the workforce. We need to: (1) Keep the state's vocational and higher ed systems vital and affordable and attractive to students from outside Maine (2) Work to support immigrant new Mainers and get this educated and qualified population assimilated and into the workforce; (3) Create an artciulated economic development plan for the State.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The funds are available now and they have been made available in the past. I am certainly not opposed to tapping a new dedicated source of revenue to pay for Medicare, but to say that the funding has not been provided is simply inaccurate. For this and other challenges facing the state we need to start returning to a process whereby the executive and legislative branches actually collaborate.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We want to assure that these funds are going to to support people who need them, and if fraud exists it should be prosecuted. Most studies, however, show that levels of fraud are wildly overstated. ""Welfare reform"" is, in general, a code term for adding barriers, providing less support for the poor or finding ways for private companies to make money providing government services. I want to see welfare programs (and Medicaid is not welfare) run by the state, efficiently, fairly, transparently.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Maine's fuel tax has failed to keep up with the cost of roads, so in recent years that revenue has been increasingly augmented by bonds. Bonding for this ongoing purpose uses resources that could otherwise be used for urgent non-road, capital projects. We should have raised the fuel tax when the price of gas was extremely low a few years ago and it would not have been painful. We still should still do this and consider indexing the tax. Tolls are only paid by road users. I like those too.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The failure of the state to assure the growth and success of the renewable energy sphere, especially solar, has been my biggest disappointment in six years. Maine should ""lay the table"" for growth in solar and other alternative energies. That said, alternatives are not enough, and we need to assure that conventionally-generated energy remains available in the amounts needed to provide backup for alternatives. We also need to provide better incentives for conservation.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I do not support changes in any of the laws relating to abortion access in Maine. I think health care decisions should be made solely and exclusively by patients, in consultation with their health care providers. I also think that better access to public health and heath education (around contraception and STD prevention) will reduce the need for abortion and other medical interventions in the first place.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against. I am not sure why home care, which is admittedly important, rises above all other important issues for the state. I don't support having a special tax to fund only home care that would give Maine one of the highest top marginal tax rates in the country. In general I would support adjusting, modernizing and broadening the tax code, maybe adding a bracket. But I want to see Maine ""in the pack"" of states, with regard to tax burden, as opposed to being at the top. I don't support surtaxes.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
The citizens voted clearly to adopt ranked-choice voting, and such an amendment is necessary to make this voting method constitutionally workable for all state offices, so I would support such amendment in order to realize the intent of the voters.

Benjamin T Collings (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Oldest, whitest state in the U.S. Most of Maine with stagnant economy for years. More training for skilled labor, encourage immigrants and refugees to move here for unfilled jobs and have children for future workforce. Invest in broadband, roads, bridges.Free community colleges and two years of free University. Invest in early childhood and K-12 education for a more prepared workforce. Alternative energy economy. More assistance for small businesses to expand. Ecotourism investment.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We already have the money available to get things going today and revenue forecasting indicates we will have money going forward to fund this. The federal government will pick up almost the entire cost, it would be ill advised from an economic and moral standpoint to refuse the federal money and not invest the modest amount that we already have available to fund the program.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
If we have true welfare reform, we should look at corporate welfare as well. True well reform also starts with guaranteed health care, affordable housing and a living wage. Without that, many working people will be forced to take public assistance.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes. Also need to invest in more public transportation like rail, we need to plan for the future. I need to study more before advising on mileage tax and other financing strategy.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Reduce carbon footprint and provide long term efficiencies. Look at a state like VT, you see solar frequently off the highway. No reason we can't do the same. Solar prices have come way down over the years. Benchmarks for alternative energy could also provide new jobs throughout the state.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Government should not interfere with the decisions of a woman and her doctor.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
As I support the concept, I am leaning towards supporting the initiative. Like many of these referendums with good intent, the language may have some flaws. In the Legislature we would have to make sure certain aspects are taken care of like individual not combined household income are taxed. It would be a lot of work to fix if is passed, but regardless, we have to do something. Taking care of our Elders is one of the biggest challenges we face and we can't kick the can down the road any further
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I publicly supported the referendum for RCV and voted for full implementation in the last session. I believe in a majority of votes, not a plurality. Don't see Republicans every joining Democrats to deliver a 2/3 vote to amend anytime in the near future.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Have an educated workforce. Work with Community Colleges and UMaine System to provide the education and skills building for current and future needs of Maine.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Should be included in all budgets going forward.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We must look for ways to effectively give services to those in need.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, solutions could include a small increase in the gas tax, looking at the possibility of increasing gas tax during high tourism months in Maine.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes, renewables energy technologies not only address the issue of climate change, but also can be job creators right here in the state.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
We must protect a women's right to choose.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against. This is a worthy initiative, but the incorrect funding model.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, the people have spoken and we should work toward that goal.
Sarah Sandlin (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine's graying population. For Mainers of all ages to thrive, we must retain and attract young people to build careers and raise families in Maine. To achieve this, we must make Maine an affordable place to live and do business in by reducing taxes and eliminating unnecessary regulations.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We need a budgeting process that funds key priorities first - including our obligations for healthcare, education, and public safety. We need to build trust on both sides of the aisle so that we are working from a common set of facts and estimates. Through increases in communication and trust we can work to fund our priorities.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We need to empower people to be the best version of themselves. The state should encourage TANF recipients to thrive independently by imposing work search requirements.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
We need to ensure that the economic activity generated by updates to infrastructure pays back interest by targeting bonds to programs that work, are efficient and have economic value to them.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes, the renewable energy sector has incredible potential for economic development. Expansion and innovation within this industry also goes hand-in-hand with preserving Maine's natural beauty for generations to come.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I support women's reproductive freedom. We must protect these rights in the interest of women's safety and privacy. Women's well-being and freedom is inextricable from the ease of accessibility to these services.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
No. We can't get people to stay here if we continue to do things to make them go. Who the tax policy is defining as a ""wealthy"" would be considered middle-class anywhere else in the country. To think that something so far-sweeping could appear on the ballot - without any type of strategic long-term plan attached - underscores the need for reform of the referendum process.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I support efforts to make the voting process more democratic. That being said, we have yet to see whether changing our constitution truly empowers people to vote their conscious.

Dale Denno (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Our biggest economic challenge is having the skilled workforce to enable entrepreneurs to start and to grow their businesses. We need to encourage young people to stay in Maine, and attract people to move here. That includes college debt relief. Low-income families need health care and nutrition so that they and their children can become productive citizens. We also need to support the integration of immigrants, the disabled and the elderly into the workforce.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Medicaid expansion is not up for debate; it is the law of the land. The Legislature passed a bill to fund expansion, which the Governor vetoed. Every dollar Maine spends on expansion will bring $9 into the state, funding thousands of jobs and taking enormous economic pressure off of struggling hospitals. Maine's current revenue projections show we can fund expansion without new taxes. Many Republican governors have done the math and realized that expansion is a good deal for the states.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
As a former Director of Maine's public assistance programs, I believe that we should start with the principle that work and independence are important to all Mainers. Every person who can work should get the support and training to find a job. Persons with obstacles to working, such as substance abuse issues, should have those issues directly addressed. Our goal should be to support families to become independent, and to enable them to raise healthy children who can become productive citizens.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, our current approach to funding infrastructure through gas taxes is becoming increasingly outmoded as energy technology advances. To the extent that we want to pass the costs of infrastructure on to the users, we need to evolve more sophisticated means to measure user impacts. Weight and mileage of vehicles, for example, might be a better proxy for user impact than gas usage.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The critical threshold question is whether we accept the scientific findings of global climate change. Not only are fossil fuels an increasingly depleted energy source, but their use is contributing to the destruction of the planet. It is irresponsible for Maine not to support investment in all renewable energy sources. Maine trails far behind every other New England state in supporting renewable energy investment. It's time for Maine to take steps to become energy independent.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I do not favor changing current law. What we do know is that there always have been abortions. The only question is whether they should be safe and legal, or whether they should be driven underground. Abortions are becoming rarer with the wide availability of contraception, and that is a positive trend. Everyone can have their own beliefs about the issue, guiding their own actions. But no one, woman or man, should have politicians telling them what they can and cannot do with their own bodies.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting no on Question 1, but not because I don't agree on the critical need for better pay for direct care providers. We are not paying enough to the people we count on to take care of the elderly and disabled, with the result that people in need are not getting the services to which they are entitled by law. My objection to Question 1 is that I feel strongly that drafting tax laws is a complex legislative process, requiring careful consideration of all of the impacts and incentives.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, I support taking the actions that comply with the express will of the voters. When ranked-choice voting was before the voters, the constitutional question was unresolved. But it is very clear what the voters intended, and amending the constitution would simply be acting to carry out the will of the people of Maine. Disregarding the stated will of the people is, to my thinking, a very unfortunate recent trend in the Legislature.

Paul B. Chace (R) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Uncontrolled spending and tax burden on business. It is hard to do business, and extremely hard to expand. People from away come with more money than the average native can spend, and expectations of urban utilities and lifestyles in rural areas is expensive. Business opportunity is greater elsewhere, our kids will follow the jobs. We have to let businesses operate, that's what creates jobs. More jobs means more tax payers. Retirees lose money staying in Maine. Freeze taxes until sale.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Maine voters were told they were expanding healthcare, not Medicaid. Ask anyone if they thought they were voting for healthcare or increased welfare, you will find many believe that it was a healthcare bill. Having operated businesses through these expansions, Medicaid expansion does not foster personal growth or opportunity. I suggest we put tapered benefits tied to work experience, and as salary and benefits grow, state assistance disappears in a sliding scale. Instead we slide backwards.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
As I previously touched on - adding work incentives and benefits that taper allowing freedom from welfare. Currently there is little incentive for a Medicaid recipient to work, and may actually cost them to take an entry level job. There are many good paying jobs available. Adding a work requirement will help folks upward. Those that medically just can't, and that is what Medicaid is for, not able bodied single adults between the age of 18 and 59 which Medicaid expansion provides benefits.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I believe that continually bonding for transportation funding is inadequate, and should be in the state budget. Do we need all of the administration in both the Maine Turnpike Authority AND the Department of Transportation? The administration side has expanded, and the toll roads now support that administration instead of being the surplus money we saw years ago. Align the two, streamline, and put transportation in the state budget. Use tolls for entering the state.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
No. The Federal rebates are very good, costs for renewable energy sources are coming down because with any free market model, supply and desire will lower prices for renewable energy products. Solar fixed costs have dropped several fold percent in the past 10 years, and will continue to do so. Incentivize these companies and their employees through business tax reform and income tax reform so that the business remains competitive and viable as a free standing business venture.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
The proverbial third rail question. The definition of loosening and restricting can be wide and variable. Access from the standpoint of ability for one to go to a clinic, I believe is not restricted. So then is loosening access mean providing tax payer money to PAY for services? I don't believe I should spend other people's money on something they did not choose. IF you buy alcohol, you pay an alcohol tax. No one else pays it. Same with cigarettes.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against. If folks want the social security tax percentage continually withheld beyond the limits of what they can receive in social security benefit at retirement. The social security withholdings stop at $128,000 income because they will never receive a benefit commensurate with their contribution as lower income workers do. Like highway spending, it should be in the budget, not on the backs of hard working Mainers.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?No. I vote for my best candidate. I don't even want to think about second or third place, because my research and preferences are to chose one person. If my choice loses, then so be it. IF I have to do further analysis after that I will, but it should be in a run off where I can apply more focus to the next choices. I am not prepared to list 1,2,3, and in many cases, may not even want 2 or 3. Ranking creates a way for a non popular candidate to get in. Where is the logic in that?

There is enough money available to use the normal budget process. Dedicated funds are LePage's excuse for inaction
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Historically, monetary support for families with children. Now used by Rs to apply to any social service aiding low income Mainers to stigmatize the program and its benificiaries.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Combination of bonds and higher gas tax, which is fair because reflects usage of roads, and reasonable because gas prices are down significantly since last change in rate.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Effect on climate change and creation of good jobs. Maine is far behind the other New England states in renewable jobs per capita.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Remove restrictions that have been added since Roe v. Wade.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Yes, but with the caveat that if enacted, the legislature should make changes to funding source, accountability, eligibility requirements and add a means test. If voters approve the measure, it will force the legislature to take up this neglected need.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, that is what the people voted for.
Dennis Ward Welsh (U)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
First barrier-taxes. Referendums that push for more taxes on working Mainers - the economic drivers of our communities and employers that hire Maine workers. Second-uncertainty. It's difficult for business leaders to plan for the future based on the climate in Augusta. Put people ahead of partisanship that is stifling Augusta. We must create an environment where start-ups want to plant their flags here. Fair taxes, a strong workforce, great education and a healthy environment in which to live.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
I believe that once Medicaid expansion is enacted in Maine, many of the funding concerns will self-correct and here's why - less emergency room visits, better access to healthcare for those most vulnerable, more stable and predictable hospital systems, lower healthcare costs and increased economic grown through an increase in nearly six thousand new jobs. This is an overall net gain for all of the people of Maine.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I truly believe that our social services are in place for those that struggle, either temporarily or permanently, in our society. Addressing the temporary first, it's important to help those in need, strengthen their foundation and get them back out on their feet again quickly and efficiently. It's in all of our best interests to do this. For those most vulnerable that need continued care, it is a reflection of who we are as a society when we care for these people. We must do it well.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
With the advent of electric cars and more fuel efficient vehicles, state and federal taxes levied on gas are going down. Hopefully fuel efficiency will continue to improve and I'm sure we will be seeing more electric cars on the road every year. This is the trajectory we want to be on. As far as maintaining our transportation infrastructure, we will absolutely have to revisit how we model that need. We will need to create a new and fair system for all users of our roads and bridges.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
In short, yes I believe Maine should continue to incentivize renewable energies here in Maine. Environmentally it's the right thing to do. Economically, it's a sector that's growing with tremendous employment opportunities. However those incentives must be tethered to measurable benchmarks for success and impact.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I would keep the laws around abortion access the same.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be strongly voting against Question 1 this November. Home health care is something we all want, but this specific referendum is flawed in a number of ways - the most egregious are the surtax on middle class families, the privacy issues, the eligibility issues, and the oversight issues. This referendum needs to be torn down and rebuilt from the ground up by experts that come from all sectors of this industry.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I do support a constitutional amendment that would allow RCV in gubernatorial and legislative general elections. It would mandate a majority rule winner, it would eliminate vote splitting and it would discourage candidates from going negative. I watched it closely in this year's primary and was favorably impressed.

Sara Gideon (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
There are three concerns that I've heard repeatedly when talking to business owners and entrepreneurs, regardless of size or industry. The first is the lack of a trained and skilled workforce. The second is access to capital. The third is reliable, high speed internet. There are countless strategies to address these barriers, but it will take all of us - Republican and Democrat, Executive and Legislative, and cross-sector partnerships - to create the environment where businesses can thrive.
[image id=""2708671"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
I have always supported efforts to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, just like the thousands of Maine voters who made this law. It is absolutely disgraceful that nearly a year later this program is still being stymied by our Executive branch. In June 2018, both chambers of the Maine legislature sent a funding bill that would cover the administrative and the claims cost to the governor's desk. I still support this legislation.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Maine's economy is recovering from the great recession at a slower rate than our New England neighbors. Based on that, here's the welfare reform I want to see -good paying jobs everywhere across this state, training and education to help transition people out of welfare and into the workforce, affordable childcare and family leave to ensure that workers can be successful in getting to work and staying at work. This is the welfare reform I believe in and what I will work towards.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
To put it simply, the way that we currently fund our roads and bridges doesn't work. In order to have high-quality, dependable infrastructure, we need to look for new, sustainable revenue streams. This will not only ensure that our roads and bridges are properly funded, but will also free up bond commitments for other priorities. The Transportation Committee has worked on a bipartisan approach in the past, and I hope that they are finally successful in the next Legislature.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
As a past member of the Legislature's EUT Committee, I have always worked to lower energy costs, encourage increased energy efficiency and promote clean and renewable energy, including wind and solar, to capitalize on Maine's natural resources and build a clean energy economy. Our energy consumption is only increasing and that the states who embrace and harness abundant, clean and renewable energy sources from our environment, will be the states that reap the rewards of energy independence.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
With the rights of women to make their own decisions about their reproductive freedoms under assault, I will always be a strong advocate for all providers of the full range of family planning and reproductive health services, including Planned Parenthood. When looking at legislation regarding abortion access, I will always ask myself if it allows women to safely make their own health decisions and control their own futures. If it does meet that critical requirement, it will have my support.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting against Question 1 on this year's ballot. While I recognize the challenges facing families who need home health services, my view is in line with the AARP and the Home Care & Hospice Alliance of Maine who believe this initiative simply isn't the answer. Moving forward, I want to work collaboratively to ensure that home health care services can function for all Maine families and that the hardworking Mainers who do it on a daily basis are adequately compensated.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
The Australians have used ranked choice voting successfully for 100 years. It has not done away with hyper-partisanship but has generally helped move political debate to a rational middle ground as opposed to the extremes. Thus far Maine's ground-breaking experience with RCV has been worthwhile. I support the expansion of ranked choice voting to all our state and federal elections.

Ralph L. Tucker (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Barriers include an aging demographic and remote geography. We need healthy, well-educated and trained work force and a stable political environment. Health care & public schools should be broadened & better funded, plus we should reestablish the state planning office and expand broadband. These efforts should retain & attract workers and businesses.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The extra $1 million, plus, in federal dollars per day for people's health care is worth the appropriation of 1/10 that amount as our state share. Health care coverage is not only a moral right, but smart economics in the long run. The cost would be less than recent revenue losses due to income and estate tax cuts for the very most privileged and wealthy.There are enough current revenues to cover the cost, in any case.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
As currently thrown around, ""welfare reform"" is often used as a dog-whistle code for welfare CUTS through statutory creation of red tape for applicants. This is unfortunately an effective and potent political tool to capture votes by whipping up voter resentments against those who may be in family or economic trouble due to no fault of their own. The voters are being cynically manipulated. Fraud can be managed by competent administration. Better to focus on the causes of economic dislocation.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
The annual highway bond should be funded in the biennial budget as an ongoing need. Bonding should be reserved for new capital projects. I am not expertly familiar with the revenue formulas and sources that underlay our transportation needs.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Because we here in Maine and over the entire Earth are choking on carbon pollution. Conservative politicians and the carbon-based fuel industry are denying a scientific reality. Short term private interests are preventing progress for the long term health of the Earth and the human race.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I support the pragmatic Roe v. Wade consensus. I also strongly support access to reproductive health care, including sex education and contraception, which will reduce the abortion rate far more than any law, no matter how restrictive. This whole abortion debate originated not primarily from religious faith, but from cynical politicians gleefully manipulating and carefully nurturing it as a wedge issue.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Undecided. The energy devoted to worthy goals such as this would be better spent in electing a sympathetic governor and a true majority legislature, rather than overriding the legislative process, especially with highly technical and controversial initiatives.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Undecided. We should see how negative and divisive the current ranked-choice campaigns pan out (Congress), compared to traditional campaigns (Governor).
Michael J. Lawler (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Keeping our young in Maine. The legislation;ature needs to craft incentives that will curb the out migration of our young men and women.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Maine has finite financial resources and I believe that first priority must be to assist the aged and disabled. There should be no assistance to able bodied Mainers until, the needs of the elderly and the disabled have been adequately funded.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The term is pigeon speak. It means nothing to me.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
No.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
No - only the wealthy can afford these renewable solutions.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe that it's a disgrace that our Nation not only allows abortions, but in many ways actually encourages abortions. There will come a day when everyone will agree that abortion is murder, and we will be ashamed of ourselves for allowing it to go on for so long.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will vote NO because retirees filing joint returns are going to get hammered on their retirement incomes and social security.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
NO - it's a preposterous proposition.
House District 51: (Map) Brunswick (part), Harpswell and West Bath
Joyce McCreight (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Our workforce challenges mean we need workers of all types: health care professionals, STEM-trained workers, those skilled in the trades, those working to provide direct care and those who work in our tourist and service industries. We need to improve access to education, training and retraining. We need an approach that looks at the many factors involved in creating the problems and could benefit from the reestablishment of the State Planning Office.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The legislature provided funding requested by the governor but he chose to veto that bill. The influx of funding through Medicaid expansion will greatly benefit our state by improving access to care with long-term benefits that are much less costly that not providing care. It makes economic sense to expand Medicaid for better quality of life and economic security, and because the influx of funds will help our entire economy, particularly our rural hospitals. So called ""free care"" isn't free.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
""Welfare"" has become a hot-button term, unfortunately. While really a neutral or positive term, it has evolved to be a divisive one. ""Welfare reform"" has come to mean cutting out the safety net that any of us could need at a time of crisis through job loss or illness while simultaneously blaming those in such crises. Rather than eliminate or reduce availability of programs and services by creating barriers to access for those most in need, we need to vigorously address any misuse or fraud.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Precisely because our funding mechanisms, i.e. gas taxes, are not meeting the obvious and predictable need to maintain and expand our critical infastructure, we need to address these needs through the budget process, addressing the issue in a more planful, comprehensive way. Recent attempts to address the changing needs by taxing fuel-efficient vehicles is not the way to fix the problem.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely. We need to be innovative in meeting our energy needs and move away from fossil fuel dependency. We can learn and grow from exploring models in other states and countries for innovative technologies, funding and incentives. We need to stop ignoring and denying the problem. As we move forward, though, me must also address the social aspects of new technologies to retain quality of life.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Access to reproductive health care for women and men should not be the political battleground it has become. Decisions of this kind, and other health care decisions, must be between the individual and the health care provider and not the purview of politicians using them for their advantage. The irony is that rather than improving access to contraception, accurate sex education, and family planning which can reduce numbers of abortions, we focus on barriers to a woman's right to her choices.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
The goal of Question 1 is laudable for the help it intends for those with disabilities and for older adults. If it passes, I expect the legislature to address the issue of who would qualify through some level of income requirement and addressing workforce needs. Referenda have been put forward in recent years to address needs not met through legislative process. I look forward to an environment that is more constructive and which truly addresses the needs of vulnerable Maine people.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I am cautious about enacting a constitutional amendment particularly when we can analyze the recent primary election (gubernatorial and a few legislative) and the upcoming congressional elections. We have the opportunity to evaluate and contemplate the impact before we make such a significant change and that seems the most prudent route.

Jennifer DeChant (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
A trained and prepared workforce is one of the large barriers to economic development. Our state needs to attract and keep young workers. This includes workers with vocational training. The legislature can support business trades education and training that is more closely aligned to the real time needs of manufacturers and tech businesses.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Funding sources have already been identified.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
It is always relevant to improve social service programs and enhance delivery systems. Therefore, reform in a consistent, equitable and efficient manner while ensuring that the neediest among us are given a fair shot at success is important reform to pursue. DHHS administers many of the social service programs and there is great opportunity reform program delivery in that context.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
The current approach to funding infrastructure improvements needs to be updated especially since indexing state gas tax ended in 2012. Right now we mostly depend on bonding to patch and improve the roads and bridges that we all depend on and that are essential for commerce. However, a bipartisan approach on behalf of the Transportation Committee and expertise of that committee is needed to develop the options possible.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
We need to move away from dependence on fossil fuels that is underscored by our old housing stock that mostly heats with oil and the rural nature of our state that requires driving long distances. Maine is uniquely positioned to be a leader in renewable energy. Short term investment to develop renewable energy industries will lead to long term efficiencies and wider availability.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I support reproductive rights.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
This is an extremely important issue that should be vetted through the legislative process and be funded through the general fund.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
A Constitutional Amendment is required to implement RCV in those state races. I will continue to support the will of the voters.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Work force training for current and future jobs. This requires better educational opportunities at all levels from high school through community colleges and our 4 year institutions. Also, we need investment in infrastructure, including broadband, a handle on energy costs, and better access to health care. We need to continue to foster Maine's traditional entrepreneurial spirit. This includes fostering the ways we've always used our natural resources to make a living while also preserving them.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Expanding Medicaid is the number one issue I have heard from voters of all ages. There was a funding plan passed by the legislature but vetoed by the current Governor. That should be revisited. I'm committed to working on this. We can't afford not to. Our state's long-term social and economic health depends on it. Too many people spend too much time struggling with decisions about how to care for their family's health needs and also pay the bills. Let's strengthen families, our best resource.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I have seen how state and federal assistance has benefited my students, whether it was access to Maine Care, or TANF, or food stamps, the vast majority of which has been short-term, in order to get through a divorce, a job layoff, an accident. Can we do better to make sure people do not take unfair advantage of these safety nets? Of course. The goal is to empower people to take control of their lives. Education, good job training, access to health care, and reducing childhood hunger are needed.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
We rely on roads and bridges to get to work, to church, to school. Given limited public transportation possibilities in my district, bonding seems sensible, given that these are long-term capital investments. The federal gas tax has not kept pace with inflation but we should be leveraging federal dollars, although the latest plans have flipped the local-federal split, from 80% federal to 20% federal, which unfairly burdens states. That said, I'm interested in working on developing other options.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. We are already feeling the effects of climate change in Maine -- sea level rise, warming seas -- and we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. This is a long-term process, but given our high energy costs, expanding incentives to encourage local, renewable energy can eventually bring those costs down. This is the future we need to build for our kids and our grandkids. We know Maine is a good candidate for solar power, even given its geographic location. Same with off-shore wind.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I support Maine law, which allows abortions before viability, and post-viability to preserve the life and health of the mother. Public funding is allowed to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest. However, in a state as large as Maine, access can be a major barrier, and as a safe medical procedure, we need better access. Supporting women and families through better education and easier access to contraceptives is key to reducing abortions, which is a deeply private decision.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
The referendum question as written is flawed. However, as a private citizen, I will be voting for this to force the legislature to deal with the larger issue of home health care for our elderly, and for our aging state. We need direct care workers, and for them to be better paid. We also need to support aging-in-place initiatives. I am committed to being part of the solution.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. It is something that the voters have supported. Other countries, such as Australia, have done this successfully. Still others, like Brazil, have run-off elections. Some states have run-offs.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Demographics. Just 34 babies per day are born here. Some leave, and others never realize their potential. Even if every young Mainer both stayed and succeeded, we'd have only half the workforce our employers need.
We need to restore the safety net and ladder of opportunity for young families, so more can contribute. We also need to be more open to solar, offshore wind, and meaningful public-private investment in broadband, to attract and retain young people in well-paid jobs.
[image id=""2708673"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Funding concerns have already been addressed. The obstacle has been the Governor's refusal to accept the funding provided by the Legislature, and to obey and implement the law passed by Maine people. 70,000 people are waiting to have health coverage. Further delay costs lives, costs jobs, and is unacceptable.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Originally, ""welfare"" meant ""well-being"" -- the good fortune, health, happiness, prosperity, etc., of a person, group, or organization.
I represent many people in dire poverty; most through no fault of their own. I'd like to see them have access to basic health care, decent housing, and food security so they and their children can more easily be productive citizens.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes. For now, we need to stop the addiction to borrowing and update the gas tax to account for inflation. In the long run, a mileage-plus-weight based fee system may be the solution, but its design and implementation will be tough.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Every energy source is subsidized, and Maine would do well to increase its share of jobs in this fast-growing sectors. That said, we don't need more incentives. What we need is a level playing field, a predictable regulatory environment, a well-trained workforce, and a governor who is not hostile to renewables.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
They should remain as is.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will vote yes. As I write this, seniors I represent are dying prematurely and without adequate home care.
Most seniors want to stay in their homes for as long as possible. Research shows it keeps them happier and healthier. Yet the average home care worker makes $12,500 per year. We are are not meeting our needs.
Incomes below $128k pay into social security. Why can't incomes above it pay into home care?
Clarifications to address opponent concerns are easy to add in the next Legislature.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. RCV allows us to vote our hopes, not our fears, and helps prevent extremist candidates on any side from winning. It empowers the voter rather than the political parties, and has worked well in Australia for a century.

Richard G. Mason (R) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
We have jobs available, but many times not enough people with the proper skills to fill them. We need Mainers to be able to fill jobs in emerging industries and bring former Mainers back home to help with the work shortage. If we can do two of those things businesses can grow because they are getting more done. Maine has a great future if we can press towards getting people to work.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Medicaid expansion is projected to cost over $150 Million in the next biennium. A way to pay for it was not included in the referendum language. The writers of the expansion should have been more thoughtful in their approach if they truly wanted expansion to be a success. Mainer's pockets are not bottomless. We can only afford so much. The next Governor will submit a budget for the legislature to consider. We will have to see what their priorities will be and proceed from there.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I believe in a social safety net, but it shouldn't be a safety hammock. Many of the reforms championed over the past few years have been a remarkable success. In fact they have been heralded nationally for their ingenuity. In the legislature I will continue so support welfare to work, cutting down on cash benefits that cannot be tracked, and working with our federal partners to make favorable adjustments to our participation in federal programs.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I believe that we have to revisit how we fund transportation. As vehicles get more efficient due to federal standards and technological advances less money goes into the highway fund. We have to start by supplementing the highway fund with general fund revenues until we find a permanent solution.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
I believe in an all of the above approach to power. We should not favor one form of energy over the other. Energy prices are calculated on a second by second basis. Maine's energy laws need to be as flexible as possible and adapt to the cheapest possible energy production and delivery method. It doesn't make sense to lock ourselves into long term contracts as is the case with some renewables like solar and wind. All energy should be able to stand on its own prices and merits.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro-life and will advocate for that position.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting No on Question 1. Special interests have stolen our citizens initiative process and this is another example of that. There is no means test, residency requirements, or accountability of funds. Hundreds of millions of dollars would go to special interests groups as defined by law. This is a gross abuse of our process and is being used by people from outside of Maine to line their own pockets. I advise voters to read the legislation before voting on November 6.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I do not support Ranked Choice Voting for many reasons and would not support a constitutional change. I would support a full repeal of RCV and a return to the voting system preferred by our constitution and our founders.

Thomas H. Martin Jr. (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
With a strong history as a small business owner, it is imperative that we work for solutions to address our skilled worker shortage. We need to come together and work proactively to entice those that are already in the state to stay, and attract those that would like to work and live our wonderful Maine lifestyle. We will get there with improved and increased access to affordable health care, lower taxes, stronger wages, less red tape, and a vibrant educational system.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We need a solid, long term funding plan for sustainability. The people's referendums are a dangerous way to legislate, there is no accountability of how to fund them, and a burden is put on the legislature to make money appear when there is none. More responsible use of the dollars we spend would allow us to expand to those additional people in need.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We need to work across the aisles to continue to reduce/eliminate waste (both internal and external). We need to make every effort to make sure resources are used to their fullest potential and allocated for programs reporting success in supporting vulnerable people. We need to work as a team to solve this issue.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
We need to get away from borrowing from Maine's future. It should be one of our top priorities; to figure out a funding mechanism that keeps up with our infrastructure needs and should be driven from General fund, Registration, and gas tax revenues. Every single person benefits from our infrastructure. The heaviest users of the system, should be paying a fair share of the cost. The most effective way to collect these funds is by reinstating the gas tax and allow it to be indexing.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Renewable energy is a business. It is not a business that is being disrupted by foreign competition, Weather event or labor shortage. They should be playing by the rules afforded any business trying to make their way. While I do encourage renewable energy technologies research and development. We should not be subsidising companies that are designed to make a profit.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe in choice.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will NOT be voting for Question 1. The question is misrepresented. The math is incorrect. It will cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars of hard earned income.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I do not. A vote is a vote.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
With near full employment and a growing economy, the biggest barrier to continued success is our workforce. As your state representative, I will work to create job opportunities by investing in trade skills and workforce training. To be competitive, we must train our children and those looking for work to fit the jobs of our future economy.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
As your representative, it is my priority to ensure that families have access to affordable, quality health care. While voters approved Medicaid expansion, the question that still remains is how to properly fund the program without abusing tax dollars. In the next Legislature, it will be the job of your representative to work across the aisle to find a funding solution that our state can afford long-term. As your state representative, I will always be at the table willing to work together.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform is ensuring that our social services programs are free of fraud and abuse. It is ensuring that your tax dollars are used for Maine families in need and not those who are taking advantage of the system. Most importantly, welfare reform is providing those families who need help at the moment a path to a job and opportunity toward prosperity.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
The state needs to continue with infrastructure improvements without passing an increased bill to the Maine people. Due to the build up of the ""rainy day"" fund and strengthening our economy over the past 8 years, we have seen a surplus in the state budget. This allows borrowing to be apart of the conversation. I would focus new ways to save expenses, such as, merging the MTA with the DOT, and working to dedicate general fund dollars, ongoing, to improving our infrastructure.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
We have a duty to protect our environment. However, I do not believe the State should play a role by subsiding companies to expand the technology of that time, making them wealthy and leaving the state always a step behind. Technology is moving quickly, and we must look to the future and what is coming and make a long term strategic plan for our state's renewable energy portfolio. When it comes to any energy policy, I will ask one simple question, ""How much does it cost the Maine taxpayer?""
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro-life.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting no. I believe Mainers should have access to affordable, quality healthcare. Heavily taxing families to put millions of dollars into a program with little oversight, and no direction on how to administer is unacceptable. Put this through the proper legislative process to ensure it is funded properly, it is set up with accountability measures, and it doesn't abuse taxpayers. Another example of out of state special interest groups trying to tell Mainers what is best for them.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. The Constitution provides voters the right to one vote. I believe in the system that our founding fathers designed and believe we should focus our time on ensuring Mainers are educated on the issues with the goal of improving our voter turnouts. That is the true way to give everyone a voice in our democracy.

Margaret Craven (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
A trained workforce, young people need to be trained in engineering, technology, and mathematics. We need to create a method for students to reduce or eliminate their student debt. Good public public transportation, and infrastructure would also help.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Tobacco moneys in maine has been shifted away from preventive care, I think this should be used to expand Mainecare as far as it would go. Otherwise the expansion will eventually save dollars because we will have a healthier workforce who will be able to work.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I think it is a derogatory term to demean people who receive a hand up.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, gas tax is not adequate, and we all need to go places. I think we could add a VAT tax to items we buy especially items that are brought in from other states. This would also help to remind people to buy local.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes! climate change is the biggest threat we face in our generation.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I think a woman's body is hers, and that it is much more destructive to restrict access to care.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I am worried about the bill as written. Taxes should be vetted and levied by the Legislature. We do need to restructure Home Care services, it is going to take a lot of planning, and that includes paying a living wage to workers.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, it gives more choice and eliminate the problem of people being elected with a minority vote.

House District 60: (Map) Lewiston (part)
Kristen Cloutier (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
We need to attract and retain new workers and families to address our current and future labor shortages. This means (among many other things) making healthcare affordable - one of the top reasons workers cite for not changing jobs or starting new businesses is the inability to maintain health insurance; expanding training opportunities for those interested in skilled trades; and providing student debt relief so that Mainers are able to get the education they need to fill the jobs available.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Mainers voted to expand Medicaid and that expansion needs to be implemented. Beginning in 2020, states that opt to expand Medicaid will receive 90% of the funding from the Federal government (more than 90% prior to 2020). If the State then taxes the extra economic activity (wages, supplies, etc.) generated by that Federal funding, and we factor in the savings from reduced state spending on traditional Medicaid, then we should be in a position to cover more than the State's 10% share.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
""Welfare reform"" is a phrase that is too often used to defend limiting access to our social safety net and cutting benefits to our most vulnerable populations. What I believe the phrase should represent is a commitment to revisiting our social welfare programs regularly and consistently to determine their effectiveness. I fully support eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse while ensuring we continue to protect these services for those who need them.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I am not opposed to borrowing money to maintain and improve our infrastructure through bonds, but that represents only one tool we should be using to fund improvements to our roads and bridges. While the Federal gas tax is becoming outdated, it also hasn't been increased since 1993, and now may be the perfect time to implement such an increase. In addition, we should consider changes that would add efficiency to the complex approval processes that slow down projects and increase costs.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Maine should be decreasing its reliance on fossil fuels in as many ways as possible. The benefits of renewable energy include improved public health through better air and water quality, the provision of future electricity needs, job creation and economic development, stable energy costs, and reliability. It is imperative that we support these technologies not only for the economic health of our state, but for the physical health of our children.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe every woman has the right to choose a safe abortion, and that lawmakers should not be impeding that choice, but rather upholding established law. Nearly 87% of US counties, including many rural counties in Maine, do not have an abortion provider, leaving a significant portion of Maine's population without access to safe abortions and at risk of related negative health consequences. I would support increasing the qualifications of NPs, CNMs, and PAs to allow them to provide abortions.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I support the theory behind this initiative 100%. My mother passed away from Alzheimer's Disease this year. As the disease progressed, we were forced to move her to a facility because having a homecare worker was too costly. However, my concerns with this initiative include the cost, the fact that it did not and will not ever receive a public hearing or a hearing before the Maine Legislature, and my belief that our priority should be on funding the Medicaid expansion already approved by voters.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. I believe this was the original intent of the initiative that Maine voters approved and that the will of Maine voters should be honored. Personally, I see a lot of value in ranked-choice voting because it requires candidates to get a majority of votes to win. I also believe that it creates a more engaged and informed electorate, and led to more positive campaigning by primary candidates who recognized the need to earn second- and third-choice support from voters.

Heidi E. Brooks (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The Legislature needs to improve lifelong learning opportunities for all members of our community. One of the biggest barriers we face is lack of a trained workforce. We can do better with apprenticeship programs, community college and higher education. We need to retain and recruit community members to fill positions that provide at least a livable wage with benefits. If people are paid a more fair wage, they will have more income to invest into the community.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The administration's refusal to expand MaineCare is probably its biggest failure. Accepting federal funds for MaineCare several years ago would have saved lives, prevented suffering, and would have infused our healthcare system with much needed resources. MaineCare could have been funded through the next biennial budget. Future Legislatures and a new administration need to come together to prioritize healthcare.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Over the past several years our social service programs have deteriorated. The public health nursing program is just one example. Public health nursing positions were dramatically cut. There was a bill brought forward by Senator Brownie Carson to help restore some of these critical nurses. It became law over a veto; however, the implementation has been poor. The Department of Health and Human Services has suffered from cuts and hiring freezes. ""Welfare reform"" has had negative consequences.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes. We need safe roads and bridges. Finding sustainable ways to fund our infrastructure is critical. The transportation budget could be improved by having the corporations using large trucks that cause the most wear and tear on our roads pay a more fair share.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. We need to be doing more to address the reality of climate change. We need to move to renewable energy as soon as possible.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
A woman's right to access healthcare needs to be preserved.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I support the universal home-care initiative. Our aging and disabled population needs to be treated with dignity and respect. Our population is aging and we need to address our home-care crisis. Providing modest home-care support can greatly improve a person's quality of life and can help them stay in their homes for as long as possible.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections because I have heard from a large number of Mainers that they would favor more choice when voting.
Michael R. Lachance (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Our high property taxes and cost of living are coupled to a government that is self-destructively pre-occupied only with coddling to non-profits, socialism, social services and so many other profitless entities that drain our tax dollars, lower standards of living and perpetuate blight. If we want economic development we will have to get over the fact that developers won't develop where they aren't welcome. So long as this bizarre fixation remains, Maine will never see true economic development.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
When Bills are not financially viable, they typically die in committee. Yet when referenda are not financially viable we expect a different outcome? Voters approve Bonds to fund Highways and Roads, yet do not present a means of funding a financially reckless Medicaid expansion. Question 1 will be no different if passed. This exposes real and critical flaws in our referendum process. It is for good reason we are a Constitutional Republic with a Representative Government and not a Pure Democracy.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
A hand up or a hand out? Ronald Reagan summed it up in 1987 when he said ""It's now common knowledge that our welfare system has itself become a poverty trap--a creator and reinforcer of dependency."" When we chose to de-stigmatize welfare we ignored the reality of human nature. So long as we award participation trophies to capable individuals who choose to sit out the game of life, we will never see true welfare reform.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Bonding in perpetuity should be discouraged. Maine needs to continue to prioritize our roads and highways without relying so heavily on bonding. Our transportation infrastructure is far more critical to the economic vitality of Maine than many other programs and expenses that are rarely bonded.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
No. Let the private sector invest private dollars in these pie-in-sky (literally) ventures. Our tax dollars are spread thin enough as it is.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Outside of the debate over abortion itself, the practice and industry of abortion should not be funded with public taxpayer dollars.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I oppose Question 1. All 4 candidates for Governor also oppose this Maine Peoples Alliance scam. Question 1 is reckless, flawed and sets dangerous precedents. Bad policy, bad for Maine and at catastrophic taxpayer expense.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I oppose Ranked Choice Voting. I also agree with the Maine Supreme Judicial Court's 2017 opinion that Ranked Choice Voting is unconstitutional in Maine and that ""when a statute �"" including one enacted by citizen initiative �"" conflicts with a constitutional provision, the constitution prevails.""

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Regulation and taxation. Make sure that the regulation aren't to onerous and that taxes to strangle the development.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Priority in funding in the budget and savings in programs.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Changing Welfare program to Work Progress Program. That way people get a hand up not a hand out.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, looking at dedicated periodic transfers from the general fund, public private partnerships, special fuel taxes dedicated to projects, and infrastructure banks to consider just a few.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Over the years oil and gas has received incentives and tax breaks. Renewable energy should be granted the same incentives. In the future as resources dictate it will be a combination of all the resources available to supply our energy needs.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
It should remain as it has since Roe v Wade with only certain restrictions for late term abortions
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Voting for. I would prefer changes to certain the bill regarding personnel and income restrictions.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I would support changes to the constitution allowing ranked choice voting.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Red Tape. Being a small business owner I dealt with and am still dealing with the red tape of starting a small business. Strict guidelines that don't fit your business, inflated fees, lack of communication or poor communication, etc. We need to focus on growing small Maine businesses that feed our economy instead of hindering it. We need to keep jobs here, keep students in our State after graduation, and therefore keeping our money here.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
What we need to get us started with expansion is there. The rest needs to be worked into the budget. The 1-9 ratio makes sense to me. Expanding medicaid has so many benefits including lessening the burden on taxpayers, getting people the preventative care they need, helping keep our older generation in their homes, providing care for those with addictions, etc.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Reforming or making changes to the current welfare systems to prevent abuse. I believe we need to work with people to help them get back to work. There should also be a gradual slide as they lose their benefits instead of just cutting people off. Studies show that once welfare reliant people get back to work there is a huge success rate in keeping them working and that means less money out of taxpayers pockets.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes, just as you budget for expenses in your home, we need to budget for the maintenance of our infrastructure. Annual borrowing and bonding only adds to our debt and paying it back usually means making cuts elsewhere.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes, we need energy independence. Other sources of power has so many benefits by stabilizing energy costs, putting money back in our pockets, and keeping money in our State grows OUR economy.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I think they should remain as they are.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting against it ONLY because the percentages are too high and imposes too much of a tax on just a select few hard working families. I believe this should go back to the legislature to be reworked because I DO believe there is a solution in helping us keep our aging population in their homes.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
At first I wasn't sure I supported this, but change is good as we continue to improve our processes. I do like how this allows us to choose the best and more importantly the worst candidate for the job.

Jessica L. Fay (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine does not have a state-wide economic development plan. By assessing Maine's strengths and weaknesses and setting goals, we can better understand where we should be focusing our economic development resources. Additionally, investing in Broadband infrastructure will allow entrepreneurs to create new businesses and allow remote workers to live where they choose, particularly in rural areas. Workforce training for the jobs of the future will provide an opportunity for new business to thrive.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The Legislature voted to appropriate the funds necessary for administration of the program in the last session, though the Governor vetoed that bill. The state has current revenue available to fund the program until we address ongoing funding through the traditional budgeting process. Drawing down the federal $1-$9 match will help stimulate the economy in the health care sector, potentially creating thousands of new jobs.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
To me, ""welfare reform"" means that we incentivize work through our social services programs, assuring that there aren't barriers to work. The cost of childcare, transportation, and a loss of benefits based on a too low income threshold are barriers to work. Tapering benefits in accordance with reasonable income thresholds and making sure that education and training are incentivized would be ""reform"" that would pay long term dividends.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Bonding to maintain our transportation infrastructure is not a sustainable solution. By bringing all stakeholders together to suggest ideas about how we might accomplish a long-range maintenance schedule, and listening carefully to every idea, we may be able create innovative funding streams. We shouldn't rule out any suggestion, and we may find that there are multiple opportunities for infrastructure funding.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Energy independence for Maine could add significant jobs and contribute to a more robust economy across the state. Currently, we subsidize fossil fuel consumption for energy and the impacts on our environment are not well factored into those costs. If we invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency, we could save a great deal in the long term on both heating and electricity costs.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Maine's abortion access laws appear sufficient at this time.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Question 1 is the beginning of an important conversation, long overdue, about how we will help older people age in place in Maine. Unfortunately, because of the language in the referendum and concerns over the funding mechanism, I can't support it.
The Legislature will be able to begin to address the issue in the next session. Looking ahead, there are some programs already in existence through the Federal government that Maine might look to as a model.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I supported such an amendment in the 128th Legislature after voters overwhelmingly approved the measure in 2016.
Gregory Earl Foster (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Businesses have left Maine or are not interested in locating here in part due to the higher cost of doing business. The legislature needs to reduce costly government imposed burdens and taxes. Lack of Broadband is often mentioned as a hindrance to conducting business in many parts of Maine. There probably is a roll for the Legislature to assist in some manner in getting this service extended, and I would entertain some kind of state partnership getting that done.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
I believe Governor LePage is correct, that Medicaid expansion should be sustainably funded without increasing taxes, funding gimmicks, or limiting coverage to those currently on Medicaid. The Legislature needs to establish priorities for funding, which may mean cutting funding to other programs to pay for the expansion.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform is when the state is in an economic position where fewer people need welfare to exist. This is accomplished when we lower the cost of government by reducing taxes and government imposed burdens for business and individuals, resulting in higher retained income and a lower need for welfare.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
I find it interesting that this paper considers gas taxes to be ""increasingly outdated"". It seems quite appropriate that taxes from gasoline are used for transportation infrastructure maintenance. If revisiting the way to fund infrastructure means creating a new tax or tax method, such as the Janette Mills tax by the mile, then I expect the old tax or tax method to disappear. Revisiting transportation funding should consider avoiding borrowing money and thus the extra cost of borrowing.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
No. Any new energy sources should become available because it is cost effective. When renewable energy costs are competitive with existing energy sources, the public will use them and demand products that use them. Additionally, we are yet unable to sustainably fund Medicaid expansion, and lots of other things. Why should we continue to find more ways to spend the peoples money, when out of the fifty states Mainers are third from the bottom in average income?
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Abortion laws should be more restrictive. Laws pertaining to the counseling of risks and alternatives in advance of committing to kill an unborn baby, are reasonable.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?I will be voting against question 1. It creates an unconstitutional fourth branch of government answerable only to board members who are accountable to nobody. There is no over-site by the legislature, the peoples only recourse for directing how their money is being spent or who is on the board. There are many other undesirable aspects of this proposal whereby it deserves to be called a SCAM.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I will not support a constitutional amendment allowing Ranked choice voting. It is a convoluted system that already has disenfranchised voters. A plurality of the vote has and will continue to work.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The lack of broadband internet access is a great barrier to bringing companies to Maine or allowing Maine residents to telecommute. Currently the ConnectMe Fund is supposed to ensure expansion and improvement of broadband service by charging a 0.25% fee on all phone bills. In contrast, the Maine USF surcharge to ensure that all Mainers have basic landline phone service is 2.1% of all phone bills. The legislature could inject more money into broadband access by revising these fee structures.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The tobacco settlement money could be used in the short term to fund Medicaid expansion. In the long term, the legislature needs to look at the total budget expenditures and develop priorities in the spending of tax dollars. Certainly, given that greater than 57% of voters approve of the Medicaid expansion, that should be given top priority.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Generally welfare reform means cutting social services. Instead, I'd like to see more of an emphasis on counseling and training of recipients. I think the focus needs to be on reviewing the barriers for obtaining and keeping a job. Is it transportation, workforce training, medical issues, children at home? Programs such as ASPIRE should be expanded to enable more people find jobs that will pay them enough so welfare is no longer necessary .
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Maine has 47,000 miles of roads funded by a 30 cent per gallon tax. By contrast, the Maine Turnpike is only about 300 miles and is funded by the tolls collected from Kittery to Augusta. Considering that everyone on the turnpike must exit onto local roads, it's time for the Turnpike Authority to start sharing some of its toll revenue to increase the ability to repair and maintain the roads most of us travel on every day.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
The state should expand incentives for renewable energy. Often, the expensive one time cost prevents many people from looking at the long term savings. As new energy technologies are used it helps to lessen our reliance on fossil fuels. And, as an added benefit, it helps to lessen air and water pollution.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I don't believe there should be any change in the access to abortion that Maine law currently allows.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting against Question 1. As the law is worded, approximately 25% of the taxes generated would be for administration costs. The Question requires a whole new Agency be created with its own board to manage these funds. I don't think we should be adding more to the existing State bureaucracy.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. If the state is doing ranked choice voting in one race, it should be consistent in other all of the races. If it means changing the constitution, then it should be done.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
It is hard to point to just one barrier. It is a combination of infrastructure, adequate skilled worker availability, and lack of vision in regards to matching potential industry with existing strengths. The Legislature can help address these issues by working to upgrade highway systems, creating state-wide internet availability, and making available multi-level job training initiatives. Finally, an incentive program needs to be established to attract compatible commerce.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Absolutely the state needs to more forward in funding the Medicaid expansion. A prosperous future for the state lies in healthy communities and its potential workforce. If need be, the funding will have to come from re-balancing the tax structure or reserves.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare is a system of safety nets provided to those individuals and families in the most need. It is intended to be a ""helping hand,"" and not a ""handout,"" so that recipients can become a productive member of society in some form.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
No. Funding infrastructure through taxes in combination the borrowing can be a workable method if the state commits to creating and following through on a well thought-out capital expenditure plan.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Absolutely yes. The path to a prosperous future for our communities and future generations will come from looking forward for sources of energy technologies which are environmentally compatible and not back to outdated energy forms. We should make available expanded but accountable incentives.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
No. They seem to be fair under current circumstances. However we should fight any attempt on the Federal level to restrict laws.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
My current position is to vote no, not that I am against the concept. However, we need to have a financially balanced policy in regards to adequately funding a multitude of wellness needs throughout our State. In this case, I am not convinced the bureaucracy that might be created, is well thought out.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
""I absolutely support a constitutional amendment to complete the citizens' desire to implement rank choice voting. I believe a lot of the current partisanship in Augusta is being caused by an election process which elects officials by plurality and not majority. It has led to a candidates being elected who have not achieved a majority of votes cast.
Ranked choice worked well in the last election for those races where it was used.""

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Attracting new and young workers to Maine and/or to stay here is a significant aspect of economic growth. Strengthening our education system, offering incentives to new businesses, and developing improved technology to meet the daily needs of local businesses will help bring economic change.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The Legislature needs to look at the benefits from implementing Medicaid expansion - a significant amount of federal funding, increase in job opportunities, support for our rural hospitals, as well as preventative care. It seems reasonable that working together, a solution for continued funding will be found and needs to be found.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
""Welfare reform"" is about seeking more efficient and just ways to assist those in our communities who need extra support and in some cases provide incentives to help individuals stand on their own.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
A strong infrastructure is vital to Maine's economy making it important to have a thorough review of current spending and future needs alongside other funding possibilities.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies is a win/win. With the right approach, it will make energy more affordable, bring new job opportunities and increase quality of life through a healthier environment.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
A woman's reproductive rights should not be controlled by state or federal law, therefore laws that inhibit a woman from making those choices for herself should not be permitted.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I agree improved home care is needed, however I do not agree that targeting a particular tax bracket is the answer. A more thorough plan needs to be looked at and a more responsible means of funding it.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections should become the norm. It is a responsible and fair means of voting allowing for a greater participation and opportunity for all.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Maine has traditionally relied on textiles, paper products, and shoe manufacturing. Those times are past. We must now innovate and evolve to new industry, hemp. Hemp can be a great cash crop which is usable for clothing, medicine, oil, livestock feed, bio-degradable plastics and pharmaceuticals. The market is there, develop it.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
We are the only country in the modern world to not have universal healthcare coverage for all. People without coverage use the emergency rooms for primary care, which costs us all dearly. I believe in a system of Medicare for All, with reasonable rates for all. Treat it like auto insurance, whereby all pay into the system and all are covered.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform is a dog whistle that has been thrown about for years by politicians, meaning 'you're lazy, get a job'. The truth is, many people either can't work or can't find a job. People are suffering, and to blame them for needing help is heartless.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
With the advent of fuel efficient vehicles and electric vehicles, gas taxes will no longer pay the way. While I don't really care for tolls, making people pay for what they use is , to me, the fairest way to subsidize infrastructure improvements. Why does I-95 have tolls from Kittery to Augusta, yet nothing beyond. The southern portion of Maine is paying for the rest of the state, while still maintaining the roads.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. People say that wind turbines are noisy and kill birds. While that may true, until you have walked the mountain trails and seen the damage from fossil fuels, we need renewables. I have, and I'll take renewables any day.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe that a woman's right to choose what she does in a decision that not only is a lifelong commitment, but a very traumatic decision, is no one else's business but hers. For others to think otherwise is wrong, it's not your right to demand otherwise.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
For. With the baby boomer generation coming to the end of life, we must realize that nursing facilities that are underfunded and understaffed will not be able to handle the load. Keeping people in their homes as long as possible is not only humane, but cost effective.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes, I do. It not only makes elections more accessible to minorities, but makes thge broken 2 party system more accountable. It gives independent candidates a more even chance of success. We have for years been voting for the lesser of 2 evils, put forth by the political parties, RCV levels the playing field.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Lack of state economic development focus on rural areas of the state. Economic growth in greater Portland, Bangor and LA has only marginal impact, at best, in western and northern Maine. Its too far too drive daily, transportation infrastructure is insufficient and skills don't match up well.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The Legislature needs to make funding the top priority among many other priorities. The federal government will provide most of the financial support and, especially in rural areas, better health care will mean healthier communities and, financially, healthier hospitals and other medical providers.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare cannot be a static program without never changing to meet the needs and challenges of Maine today. It means recognizing some of the more significant barriers to work, such as lack of affordable childcare and a depressingly low minimum wage, and working to correct those situations so folks who want to work can and those who don't are treated accordingly.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Infrastructure is almost always a capital item so funding by bonding makes good financial sense. The gas tax needs to be revised to address the situation of electric and hybrid car drivers not paying their fair share for use of roads. My wife and I have two hydrids and we are more than willing to pay our fair share.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Of course. The solar and off-shore wind industries are ready to explode in growth and need the same types of incentives that many other states provide. Not only will they provide solid alternatives to more traditional electrical generation, they represent terrific employment opportunities for our residents and investment opportunities for our Maine-bred entrepreneurs.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Remain as it is.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Yes. Under almost any circumstances, in-home and community support services are less costly than nursing homes. While the referendum question may not be perfect, if approved by the voters it would represent a quantum leap in keeping senior citizens and those with disabilities in our communities and neighborhoods.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. I think it is a terrific idea. The choice among candidates is not always black and white. Ranked choice voting allows me to select an order of priority among candidates. A vote for one does not automatically represent rejection of another candidate since I can still support the second candidate as my second choice.

Christina Riley (D) - Incumbent
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Too many people in our rural areas make too little money, because the manufacturing sector has dwindled. We should revitalize the State's forest-products economy by investing more in bringing new technologies, like nanocellulose products and cross-laminated timber, to the market, so that Maine can be on the forefront of their production. The export of locally-manufactured forest products is a powerful economic influence, and we are in prime position to capitalize on the opportunity.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
The Governor vetoed the funding the Legislature allocated. Considering that he also proposed to cut taxes by more than the expansion's cost, it is clear that sees that the funding is available, but he prefers to cut taxes rather than complying with the law. Mainers have chosen repeatedly via the Legislature, and in a general vote, to expand Medicaid, and it is the Governor's sworn responsibility to faithfully execute that law using the funding the Legislature provided.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
We need to balance the needs of the downtrodden with those of the more fortunate, in order to have a livable society for everyone. Creating good policy depends on understanding economics, human psychology, and history, rather than responding strictly to populist impulses. People with disabilities and other difficult circumstances should be employed as fully as possible, but regardless of their ability to work, they should have what they need to live satisfactory lives.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
It is urgent that we do. Like any tax policy, it is complicated, and the angles evolve as technology and trends change how we live. The funding plan needs to reduce our dependence on bonds for infrastructure needs, while balancing the impact on taxpayers and those who use the roads. The burden should not fall inordinately on business, as the pass-through effect of the tax only makes it harder for certain Maine industries to compete.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
All energy is subsidized; I support shifting subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables, partly because it is an economic opportunity for Maine, which has no fossil fuel resources. Renewable energy is a natural resource that we should manage just like we manage our forest resources, with a strong mandate to protect the natural environment. We should prioritize the types of installations that bring the greatest benefits to ratepayers as a whole, such as community solar and grid-scale storage.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
We should make every effort to prevent unintended pregnancies, but I generally will not support measures that will make it more difficult for a woman to exercise her right to control her fertility. When we do that, wealthy women travel for abortions and poor women risk mutilation. Given sufficient access to education and effective birth control, people are better able to avoid unplanned pregnancies, and our public policies should encourage that.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
This initiative would help my own family, but I cannot support it. People who are older or who have disabilities should have the support they need to stay in their homes as much as possible. But this initiative would create legislative gridlock much as the school funding initiative �"" Question 2 of 2016 �"" did. It is not sound tax policy. We have existing programs that could better serve the need if funded properly, but those funds should come from the general fund, not a surtax.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I do. The initiative passed, showing that Mainers do want this style of voting. If two-thirds of the Legislature passes the amendment, that question will also go to voters. This is the only path to fully implement what started as a citizens' initiative, and unless there is a pressing reason not to fully implement it, which I do not see, we should respect that. No one is forced to use ranked-choice if they prefer not to.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Workforce training, there are many jobs available in the trades but we have a shortage of workers to fill them. We need to encourage and incentivize Mainers that want to pursue a career in the trades.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
I believe there needs to be a long term sustainable funding source attached to the medicaid expansion. I don't believe in using one time sources or gimmicks is the way to go. We also need to prioritize so that Maine's most vulnerable are at the front of the line rather than able bodied adults with no children.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform means requiring people that are able bodied to search for a job. We should judge the success of welfare by how many people we move off the rolls. We need to crack down on those that have used EBT cards out of state in vacation destinations such as Disney World or Las Vegas.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
One of the great successes of the last 8 years has been our bond rating has improved from when Baldacci was in office. This allows us to borrow money at a lower interest rate. I would support bonding for essential projects as long as there is no pork in the bill.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
I don't believe in subsidizing any energy resources by raising the electric bills of low income and elderly Mainers. If solar and wind power can compete in a free market, I am all for it. I don't believe state government should subsidize it.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro-life, and believe that life begins at conception. This is an issue that has become far too polarized in American politics. I know good people that I respect that feel differently. As far as laws, I would support restrictions on abortions when the baby is viable outside the womb.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting on on question 1. I believe that it is a tax on job creators that will cause those people to leave Maine. I also don't like that it creates a shadow government board that is not accountable to the taxpayers of Maine. It is another example of why we need to fix the referendum process to make it harder for out of state special interests to accomplish their goals.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No, I am opposed to ranked choice voting along with 57% of the voters of Leeds, Livermore, and Turner. I believe in one person, one vote. If I am elected I will represent their voice in Augusta, not Portland and out of state special interest groups.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The aging population of Maine. Create service, apprenticeship, job training and other opportunities to retain/recruit young people to work in Maine.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
This is now law and it is up to the Legislature to fund it through the state budget process.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
The term often means measures designed to remove people from the state's entitlement programs.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Bonds are legitimate ways to fund infrastructure and should be used now, before interest rates climb. In addition, there should be a broad discussion about the needs of the future and if there are additional sources of revenue.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Fossil fuels contribute to global warming and are finite. We need a comprehensive energy plan for Maine. The expansion will also create jobs.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
Neither.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against. It is not a long term solution to the issue that we face.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. This is the will of the voters expressed through the referendum process.
Dennis L. Keschl (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Barriers are Maine's high tax burden, high cost of energy, and lack of qualified applicants for available jobs, and an infrastructure geared for the 19th and 20th century not the 21st century. The Legislature can reform our tax system, provide incentives for infrastructure investments, invest in our community colleges focused on STEM courses and collaborative efforts between our businesses and community colleges, and broaden the use of alternative energy sources to include nuclear energy.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Medicaid expansion passed by a citizen initiative process became law without identifying a funding mechanism. To fund it, in part, the Legislature must look at its current budget and seek reductions. We may have to reduce scope of existing programs or completely eliminate them. We cannot look to the ""rainy day fund"" or an increase in taxes. A review of our current tax structure and tax expenditures, included a broadening of our sales tax may provide funds necessary.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare reform means making those changes in our societal support system that are necessary to ensure that it is a true ""safety net"" and not a way of life for those who are participating in it, and those who are participating in it should be limited in what they can purchase and where they can purchase it. The State should provide support and help recipients to become self-sufficient without relying on the state.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes we should revisit it, however, bonding will be part of the mix that is used to fix our highway infrastructure for some time into the future. Maine should ""think out of the box"" for ways to enhance current federal and state taxes that raise money through the sale of energy needed to fix and maintain the our highway infrastructure, up to and including new GIS locational technology.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Encouraging renewable energy using incentives that put more cost on low-income Mainers is not right. If there are people who want solar and wind energy project for their residential dwellings...they should purchase them. Large scale solar and wind are not environmentally friendly nor do they provide base power load which we need. Maine should look at it current policy on supporting modern, modular nuclear power plants development.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
The issue of access to abortions is settled law through the Supreme Courts decision on Roe vs. Wade.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I am voting no on Question 1 for many reasons, including issues involving its constitutionality, problems with the body overseeing its implementation, potentially significant HPPA violations, and the fact it is a job killer. People writing these initiatives promise so much when in fact they deliver little, but cost Mainers significant time and money. As I currently understand it, not one of the four gubernatorial candidates supports this question.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. Ranked Choice Voting is a scheme that promises to deliver a majority that is not a majority of the total vote cast, thus it disenfranchises voters. I believe that there are strong constitutional problems with it, including the violation of a basic principle...""one-person/one-vote. It is a terrible law that is subject to gaming.

Reduce spending on unnecessary items .
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?

4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
If the fuel taxes were spent on infrastructure which it was mean for we wouldn't need to bond every election cycle.

Businesses consider several factors in deciding where to locate and how much to invest. Among these are taxes, regulatory environment and a trained workforce. The Legislature should establish a tax structure that is more attractive than that of other states, enact regulations that are stable and predictable, encourage private sector employers to work closely with our educational institutions, and always keep in mind that it needs to listen to job creators when setting public policy.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Funding should first of all be sustainable. Using one time resources is not the answer. Requiring able-bodied people to work or be on the path to employment and also paying at least a small portion of the costs should be included. We will need to choose what other programs may have to be curtailed in order to pay for it since Maine does not have an infinite supply of funds, We will have to prioritize so that the elderly and others who are the most in need to not get overlooked.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Some welfare reform has already begun and it needs to continue. It should be stressed that for most people, welfare is a temporary situation and there always needs to be a path out of it, probably through a tiered program towards economic independence. Any recipient who is able should be required to seek work or be in a a training program that will lead to gainful employment. We should also refine the list of what is eligible for welfare payment so that only real necessities are included.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
We should rely less on borrowing, especially a interest rates are rising. Money spent on interest is money that can't go directly towards improving our infrastructure. We may need to revisit the gas tax, but by no means should we allow automatic escalators to increase it every year. We should also charge fees on electric vehicles so that their owners pay their fair share of fixing our roads. We should also continue to find more ways to stretch every tax dollar we take in.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
I am all for renewable energy as long as it is competitive in price. I am generally not in favor of more incentives since they are in essence subsidies, and subsidies normally mask the true costs of anything, including energy. It is unfair to ask poor people to pay parts of the electric bills of people who are often much better off financially than they themselves are. We shouldn't ignore the fact that some of the alternative energy construction is an eyesore to many people and hurts tourism
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I am pro-life and do not want abortion access laws loosened. We need to respect the value of human life more, even for the pre-born. Any abortion clinics should be required to meet licensing requirements similar to other medical facilities. Counseling on alternatives to abortion should be required, a waiting period established, and in the case of minors, parents need to be involved.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
No. Proper care for the elderly and disabled should be the goal, but this is not the answer for a number of reasons: there is no needs requirement so that very well off people would get free care; there is no residency requirement; there is an unlawful invasion of privacy regarding people's health records; the huge income tax increase would drive many high tax payers to other states; and there is absolutely no accountability to any oversight agency, making it rife for abuse.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. It violates the principle of one person, one vote by allowing a voter's 4th, 5th, or whatever choice it may be to have the same weight as my first choice. We should remember that the original referendum question setting this in motion did not pass by much, and many parts of the state, including my district, voted against it. It is another example of how a well-funded outside group can force its will on others. The entire issue of the referendum process needs to be addressed.
Stephen Ball (D)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
Health care. This affects the entire chain from ownership to workers. A broken health care system means that Mainers are making some sort of compromised decision about hiring, expanding, paying rent, buying food, paying electricity bills, etc.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
I disagree that there is a lack of ""dedicated funding"". This is largely because of a desire by the previous Governor to not support ""dedicating"" the money. We've got money to last through 2019. This is, for many Mainers, a dire situation made worse when nearly six out of ten voters of Maine voted to approve this. The fact that we're still not putting this into action is a display of ideological and bureaucratic choice. I would fund this beyond 2019 by budgetary means.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
I believe that the welfare system requires fundamental change. The basis for support must be transformed to incentivizing work rather than punishing the poor. We require investment in targeted training and mentorship. To be angry at welfare doesn't make the problem go away. We also need to allow people to wean themselves off of support in a manner that does not make going unemployed a better option than working in any level of work.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Yes. The fuel tax in America has not been raised since 1993 and it is not indexed to inflation. We need to seriously look at raising the fuel tax and updating the new legislation in ways that account for use by electric/hybrid vehicles. In addition, Maine needs to consider a comprehensive long-term infrastructure improvement plan. While this is costly, I would argue the associated benefits to commerce, economy, jobs and communities far outweigh increased short-term expense.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes! Utilities are changing and our laws and economy have not caught up. We need to support incentives to consumers and businesses to transition to renewable energies. Not only is this sound policy in support of Maine's precious resource, its environment, but it also can stimulate and enhance Maine's reputation and position nationally and internationally in research and manufacturing in renewable energy sciences and industries.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I believe the current laws are adequate and proper. I believe that medical decisions about a person's body are between them and their physician.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
I will be voting against it, however, I will be working to address what the referendum is trying to accomplish, healthcare and home services support for elderly in Maine. I would say that the Referendum is another case of desperately trying to find a solution to a complex and dire problem that is not being responsibly addressed by the Legislature.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
Yes. While I'm not sure it would pass, I think we really do need to consider and debate the state of our elections in Maine. Most of what RCV attempts to address is that lack of broad consensus, and thus support, when there are more than two candidates for leadership in Augusta.

1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
The biggest barrier to our economic development is a failure to realize what makes our state so special and a lack of creativity about how to capitalize on our assets in the modern economy. The lack of broadband is inexcusable. People can work from anywhere today, but not in most places in Maine. Given the quality of life possible here, we should be doing all we can technologically to make Maine the gold standard. Broadband would help our students, attract investment, and increase population.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Funding could be addressed in at least two ways. One, revisiting the tax cuts passed over the past 8 years to see if they are fair and reflect a progressive tax system. Two, again looking at our assets, we should consider raising our lodging tax. If Maine is Vacation land, and it seems to be, tourists will continue to visit. The resulting expansion in revenue could help fund the voter approved expansion of access to health care.
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
How a society treats those who are struggling and in need, defines it. We must continue to help those who cannot help themselves, while looking to make sure that people can find opportunity and escape poverty. True welfare reform is about making prosperity possible for all through education, training, and some support.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
Knowing that nobody likes taxes, sometimes they need to be updated and increased where appropriate. The quality and safety of our roads and infrastructure is not a partisan issue; at least it should not be. State and federal gas taxes have not come close to reflecting inflation for far too long. If we do not look at them, we are being incredibly shortsighted.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
Yes. Climate change is real if one looks at and believes science. I do. Our reliance on fossil fuels is a major cause. Solar power and responsible wind power development can decrease reliance on the fuels that fuel climate change. We have traditionally incentivized fossil fuels because private players make money. The cost for renewable energy benefits the public and our planet.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
A woman's choice about her healthcare should be made by her and her medical professional. The state need not play a role other than insuring access to health care.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
While I do not think Question 1 is perfect in its current form, I support it and will vote yes. Maine is the oldest state in the nation. Maine, as does our country, has a broken health care system. We need radical changes. People should have the option of aging in home when possible because it is good for them and the economy. Nursing home care expenses far exceed targeted home care supports. Sometimes a referendum is necessary to prod the legislature to do what is right. See marriage equality.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
I support rank choice voting in state elections because that is what Maine voters have said they want. It is their call. I am not certain if an amendment to our constitution is needed to make the will of the voters law.

Earle McCormick (R)
1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?
For businesses to expand in Maine or relocate to Maine, we must have an available work force with the skills necessary for that business. I support making the Technical Centers and Community Colleges available to more students and working with private sector businesses to ensure their skill needs are met.
2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?
Implementing this referendum requires a significant long-term funding source. This would have been simpler if the referendum question included the funding source. Do the voters who approved this expansion expect it to be paid for by reducing funding to other programs, raising sales taxes, raising income taxes?
3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?
Welfare Benefit programs are put in place to provide assistance for those in need. Each comes with qualification guidelines and expectations for use. If data shows the benefits are being used for illegal activities or requirements are not being met, then the Program may need to be reformed to correct the problems.
4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?
No, maintain current process for now.
5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?
I support the current Federal and State tax incentives for people who want to install renewable energy technologies on their homes and property.
6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?
I would support the availability of more education and guidance on the alternatives to abortion.
7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?
Against. The $300 million income tax increase would make us a less attractive State for people to live and work. The private Board created to spend these funds would be subject to little, if any, public accountability. Clearly there are many needs in this area, but we must get all the interested parties together at the table to create legislation to resolve these issues.
8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?
No. I want to listen to all the candidates and vote for the one who best reflects my priorities and values.

Michael Nadeau (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Until the Maine state government creates a long-term plan for taxes, utilities, energy, referendum funding, education goals, specialty training programs and streamlining/ vetting the bills introduced for legislation, we can expect what we are getting. We can do better. Revamping from the top.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\As a part of a comprehensive plan with priorities in place, the Legislature should review all spending, identify needs and obligations, and change the budgeting process to reward departments that return unused funds. A mechanism should be in place to deal with unfunded mandates from referendums like ranked choice voting and expanded Medicaid expansion. There is only so much in the budget. Which programs do you fund?\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\It means if a person need help, help is available until that person is ready to resume work. It doesn't become a way of life. The money is spent on necessities, not luxuries. The recipient must be looking for work. It should not be used for vacations or bail. It should be used by recipient only. There should be immediate suspension and lifetime revocation for abusers.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Again, we are looking at this as reactive instead of proactive. When the state is always spending beyond its budget, we are saddled with debt. Planning, saving, and identifying priorities will give us the information needed to fund immediate and future needs. Annual borrowing should be reduced and not be used as an open credit card.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I am in favor of renewable energy (solar, wind, etc.) but they need to be self-efficient, not taxpayer funded. They also need to be part of a statewide plan to reduce energy costs.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am Pro-Life, and until I see the details on laws or proposed laws if any, I will not speculate.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\No on One. I would much rather expand home care services with the home care groups that are already doing it now. These groups have oversight, accountability, HIPPA certification and are on the road already. Expanding what we already have is the best option.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No, one person, one vote. This process complicates voting and costs taxpayers an additional $300,000 above original costs. The costs of this could have gone to expanding home care for seniors.\Senate District 2\Michael Carpenter (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Certainly workforce development is now and will continue to be a problem. We don't have enough people trained in the skills of the 21st century. The legislature will need to continue to provide resources to the post-secondary education facilities of the State, in particular the Community College system.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Currently, there is sufficient money in the budget to implement the expansion and,going forward we will need to budget for the costs.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\We need to continue to fine tune these programs so that able-bodied adults have to work when they can.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I believe that we have to continue to look at all options but that the gas tax should be in the mix. Our infrastructure is in need of serious attention over the next few years.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I believe that there should be an exploration of expanded incentives for alternative energy sources. Renewables need to be a growing piece of our energy mix.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\As long as Roe continues to be the controlling law state legislatures are somewhat hampered in making changes.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Probably voting No. I have read the underlying bill and it is quite complex. While I don't practice health care law, I do have some privacy concerns.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Given that it seemed to have to work well in the primary election and that the voters have twice supported it, I would support a Constitutional amendment.\Karen Ann Reynolds (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\High taxes and a limited ""skills ready"" workforce are factors keeping companies from setting up shop or expanding in Maine. Eliminating barriers will mean continued, improved communication with investors and collaborating with all schools ( high school and beyond) so that everyone wins-- best training to produce best workers for the best jobs. I support work ready education and tax reform measures to make Maine attractive to live, work and play.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\As a fiscally responsible conservative, Medicaid expansion must be funded in a way that doesn't hurt our hospitals or our most vulnerable. We need our local hospitals open to serve our population and they cannot continue to be uncompensated for that care. Maine is a poor state. I do not see how Expansion can go forward unless it has a true identifiable funding source.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Compassion, coupled with common sense. Welfare reform means helping those who are struggling through tough times, while ensuring it is not being abused. Welfare benefits are meant to be temporary. Meaningful work is the objective and cure to most social ills.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Infrastructure is a cost of doing business in Maine. A strategic plan for funding is crucial for advancing future growth. We must continue to study how other states are successfully funding it, other than simply borrowing.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I like our innovative spirit and I'm confident that these industries will continue to grow without further incentives.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am a Pro-Life candidate and believe that Maine's current law of ( restricting) public funding for abortions ONLY in the cases of life endangerment, rape or incest is reasonable.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting NO. It is another expensive, misleading and out of state backed referendum. Like most of these ""tax hike"" initiatives, it does not appear to be well thought out for the people or future of Maine.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No. I vote for the person, not the party, and not the process.\Senate District 3\Jeffrey B Johnson (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Several things need to be addressed simultaneously. We need to create much better access to affordable training and skill development to fill good paying jobs that are available right now in parts of the State. Rural Maine is really lagging behind in the creation of good paying jobs. We need to build out our broadband infrastructure to make rural parts of the State, like many of the areas in State Senate district 3, able to compete in a global market.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\There is a lot of waste in our Medicaid programs that needs to be addressed, most certainly in the layers of administration and unnecessary regulatory red tape that doesn't improve outcomes. I've owned and run companies that do business with Maine Medicaid for the past thirty years. Strong, common sense leadership demanding very attainable efficiencies coupled with federal dollars will create long term sustainable funding.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\We all want people to have the help they truly need. There is a small percentage of people that have short term challenges that receive benefits too long. Instead of giving someone a hand up, that small group receives help long term. That's wrong. And there are people who truly need services now that can't access them. That's wrong too. We desperately need more business sense in managing these multi billion dollar programs and much less political fighting.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\We absolutely need to revisit the way we fund our infrastructure. One clear option that other states and communities has leveraged much more than Maine is mini bonds. Mini bonds allow for local private and public investment at lower interest rate payments for those communities. It allows for more local control as to what infrastructure needs to be upgraded, and who is going to be hired to do the work. Local control. Lower cost. We should be accessing infrastructure funds much more this way.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes, we should expand incentives in thoughtful, smart ways. As a state we need to reduce our carbon footprint and do everything we can to have our Maine look and feel to our kids and grandkids the we we experience it. We need an aggressive sustainable energy plan put together by nonpartisan experts. And we need good leadership to work that plan. Strategic planning and good implementation of the plan happens everyday in my businesses. Mainers deserve at least as much.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Personally I oppose abortion. I can't imagine advising anyone in my family to have an abortion if they were to ask my opinion. However, I feel very strongly that it is the right of a woman to decide what is right for her. I oppose the government intervening in that decision by making abortions illegal. I don't think access should be loosened or restricted. Our laws should remain as they are.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I'll be voting against it. We all want people to stay in their homes as long as possible. But Question 1 creates an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and higher taxes.The way to fund in-home supports is to cut the bureaucratic waste within DHHS, Dept of Education, and Medicaid. Ask someone who works in one of those state agencies about waste they see. I've been doing business with those state agencies for thirty years. I see it everyday. It's time for some common sense business decisions\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do not support a constitutional amendment. The people have spoken via referendum and we now have ranked choice voting for some elections. I say let's continue to try it and see how it works. Time will tell Maine voters if we like ranked choice voting or not. If we like it then we can talk about an amendment; if not then we repeal it. We have some time.\Bradlee T. Farrin (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Lack of a skilled workforce shortage is a huge barrier for economic development. Businesses looking to relocate or expand in Maine are discouraged from doing so because finding the man power is a struggle. That is why I am such a supporter of expanding access to the trades in Maine's schools. Maine needs a skilled workforce in order to encourage development and create a state where our young people can live, work and raise a family.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Medicaid expansion is now law, but we need to fund it in a responsible manner. Maine has expanded Medicaid before, and it led to a massive debt owed to our hospitals. Nobody wants to repeat the mistakes of the past. I also don't want to see those on wait lists for services waiting even longer because funds have been redistributed to Medicaid expansion. We need to find a way to pay for Medicaid expansion so that it does what is was meant to do, help people.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform means making common sense changes to programs to ensure that those who need them have access to them, and that the money is used in the most effective ways possible. Welfare is meant to be a hand up, not a hand out. I believe that it should be used when those landing on hard times need help, but it should not be a long term solution for people. I also believe there should be a pathway from getting assistance to independence, instead of all or nothing.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Bonding is certainly not the preferred method to pay for our roads and bridges. With cars becoming more fuel efficient, we have seen revenue from the gas tax decline. I served on the Transportation Committee in the 127th Legislature and I have a couple of ideas to address this problem. We don't have a revenue problem in Augusta, we have a spending problem. For starters we need to ensure that money intended for transportation is not diverted to the general fund.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\No. The cost of renewable energy technologies have deceased dramatically. Solar and wind have a place in Maine's energy portfolio, because a diverse portfolio is a strong one, but I think that those energy sources can now compete on their own without being subsidized.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I think that this issue has largely been addressed by the Supreme Court and is a Federal issue. I don't intend to introduce legislation concerning this topic.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting no, for a number of reasons. It is a bad idea for Maine. This is another example of out of state interest trying to force bad policy on Maine Citizens through the referendum process. As Legislators and Voters we need to fix this process to outside money from influencing how we live our lives.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do not. I have never been a supporter of this voting method. I think that it is more costly, and confusing to voters. I believe in one person, one vote.\Senate District 4\Paul T. Davis Sr. (R) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\I have talked to many local businesses small and large, the cost of energy, high taxes and regulations are all job killers.\The State of Maine needs to look hard at regulations that curtail growth. With a new administration Maine also needs to look hard at every program in state government to make sure every dollar is being spent wisely.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I think the tobacco settlement money should be used for this, along with any surplus we have. if this is not possible than the legislature needs to find on going funding without raising taxes.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\To me this means a tighten up of the benefits to those getting welfare. Welfare needs to be available only to the truly needy.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes it should. I think we should look to the general fund to help provide funding for our roads and bridges. Also the sales tax paid on tires, batteries, vehicle parts should go to the roads and bridges. State government should never be allowed to raid the transportation fund.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I support solar power. However I do not support wind power. Maine should not be a pass through state to bring energy to other states. Maine must receive benefits from energy coming through Maine.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am pro life.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I oppose question one. . I think to have such a high income tax rate in the tax bracket it is aimed at would hurt the state by driving the folks that create jobs from Maine and keep them from coming to Maine. .\Question one has no income restrictions. Wealthy folks can receive benefits from this idea. I think we should do all we can for the elderly but this is not the way.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No. I would support a runoff election between the top two candidates. I think rank choice is far to confusing for most people.\Susan D. Mackey Andrews (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Access to healthcare insurance is the biggest barrier to economic growth and sustainability. Costs are prohibitive; access is limited while the need for healthcare is widespread. Many Mainers work more than one job to cover healthcare costs or defer retirement to keep their healthcare. Expanding Medicaid access is a partial solution, coupled with a long term approach that employs a more universal approach to healthcare emphasizing prevention and early access to comprehensive care.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Access to meaningful, affordable healthcare is the #1 priority for Maine voters. Let's fund expansion with state surplus dollars and ensure responsible, future funding to include an overhaul of Maine's Medicaid program to include participant fees, co-pays and deductibles based upon ability to pay as well as recognition of the savings realized from improved health and worker participation and productivity.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Poverty has always existed, but it has become deeper and more divisive. Today's ""welfare reform"" means limiting access, which has exacerbated the ""us and them"" argument, unfairly punishing many people who legitimately need our help. To me, responsible welfare reform views assistance as temporary but also, as comprehensive – beyond the basics. It should include addressing the whole person and his/her needs in planning and service delivery as well as education, the great equalizer.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes, we should examine alternative ways to fund our roads and bridges that are within the state's budget and stop relying on bonds. The latter approach leaves investment in our infrastructure less strategic, integrated and long-term. There should be some relationship to ""use"" as a factor when assigning cost, and we need to recognize the need for equal investment in our rural and urban infrastructures.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Definitely yes. Solar in particular is an incredibly viable solution to stem the use of fossil fuels and to maintaining our clean environment. Maine should focus on these alternatives with balance, recognizing the importance of our pristine lands within the context of our growing tourism industry. There surely is a balance we can strike here, putting the values of Mainers first, protecting our lands while moving towards increased energy independence for our state.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support maintaining the current Maine law protecting a woman's right to access comprehensive healthcare. More unintended pregnancies are prevented through comprehensive women's healthcare programs, including access to birth control and cancer prevention/detection/treatment. If a woman makes the difficult decision to terminate a pregnancy, it should be a safe and medically available procedure.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I support the concept of Question 1 because I know too many families forced into poverty by caring for an aged parent or child with life-long disabilities. Our state budget, like our personal budget, is a statement of our values and if home-care is one of our values, we should ALL participate in financing this. I prefer home-care to be a state funded initiative rather than the current proposal, and will vote against Question 1 for this reason alone.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes, I do support a constitutional amendment to ensure ranked choice voting in all Maine elections. I believe that ranked choice voting more accurately reflects the vote of the majority and provides more choices to voters beyond the two party system.\Senate District 5\James F. Dill (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\""Keep & attract young folks to work, buy homes & raise families\Student loan debt relief, entice young people to work & live here for at least 5 years in exchange for debt reduction\Better access to quality childcare & support businesses by raising reimbursement rates for childcare providers for eligible working families\Support bonds for post-secondary education to have a system where Mainers can gain more skills and knowledge\Modernize our broadband network, allowing access to the world\[image id=""2708687"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Estimates from the Legislature's Office of Fiscal and Program Review, is that there is funding in the state MaineCare accounts to pay the State's share of the costs of coverage for the expansion population until the final quarter of FY19. The Legislature passed a bill, LD 837, which prepared us for the ramp-up of enrollees, but was vetoed by funding additional positions at DHHS and updated computer technology. This bill needs to be reintroduced next session.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\The term welfare reform means finding the correct balance between making sure our fellow Mainers have a safety net in place for hard times and ensuring that taxpayer dollars are not allocated to those who don't need them, or would use them fraudulently. I support restrictions on welfare that disallow the money to be used for lottery tickets, cigarettes, and other goods that are not central to Mainers' health. I support limits on public assistance that remove the incentive for folks to seek work.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Perfectly, Maine would have money in its Highway Fund to pay for all infrastructure improvements. I don't want to incur debt, but I worry more about our roads and bridges. A recent report from the Am. Soc. of Civil Engineers gave Maine a C- overall, and a D for our road quality. Many alternative funding sources would amount to another tax, either on drivers' licenses, hybrid cars, or registrations. I do not want to burden Mainers with more tax. I am also open to public/private partnerships.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Renewable, sustainable forms of energy are potentially cheaper, better for the environment, and create jobs. I absolutely support the state incentivizing people to explore alternative energy sources.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I think the laws are right where they should be. This gives individuals the right to choose, hopefully after seeking guidance from resources they trust.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Probably no. Mainers are already taxed too much, and one of my main objectives in the Legislature has been to reduce property taxes. The Legislature is elected to appropriate existing tax revenue consistent with our shared priorities. I can't support higher taxes, when the state is trying to lure people here.\I believe our seniors are the backbone of our communities and I should have the best care possible. I sponsored a bill to fund senior assisted living facilities and it easily passed.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes, I have consistently voted for a constitutional amendment in the Senate and plan to continue to do so. The voters approved it through a referendum and since it is in conflict with the State Constitution, it needs to be fixed.\Maia Dendinger (U)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\The biggest barrier to economic development is capitalism- a system based on the exploitation of workers & the environment to make profits for the 1%. We need to transition to a socialist economy, consisting of worker cooperatives, owned and democratically self-managed by the workers, and committed to meeting community needs. We must enact policies that support worker ownership, and establish a job guarantee program that provides communities with resources to put people to work at a living wage.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\It is not a question of whether the financial resources are there, but rather how they are apportioned. If there was funding to give $30 million to General Dynamics, there is money to ensure that sick Mainers receive the care they need. I support Maine Allcare & the fight for universal healthcare in Maine. Because Mainers already pay for healthcare (whether out-of-pocket or in the form of insurance premiums & co-pays) even a commensurate tax increase would ultimately save Mainers' money.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\I believe we must protect and boster our social service programs. I support food assistance on demand for anyone in need, without invasive testing and wasteful bureaucracy. Every human being should be provided equal access to the necessities of life, including nutritious food, clean water, housing, education, healthcare, and meaningful work.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\We must move away from regressive policies such as the gas tax, which disportionately affects the poor and working class who can least afford to pay such taxes, and instead we must continue to explore alternative sources of funding.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Transitioning to renewable energy is necessary if we want to prevent the worst effects of global warming. Researchers have shown that it is possible to achieve 100% renewable energy in Maine by 2050, creating thousands of jobs in the process. Energy production should be in the hands of communities, not big business. That's why I support the creation of community-owned energy cooperatives as the basis of a renewable future.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I believe abortion should be free and accessible for anyone who needs those services.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting for the home-care citizen initiative because I believe all Mainers deserve access to necessary care. In fact, I believe that this initiative does not go far enough; in addition to providing care for the elderly and disabled, we must also provide childcare for all who need it. Too often, working-class women are forced to provide care-work without pay; we must ensure that care providers are treated fairly and also that elderly and disabled Mainer have access to the care they need.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\As a socialist, I am firmly committed to the principle of direct democracy and maine's ballot initiative process. If I am elected as a state senator, I will support any and all citizen initiatives passed by the people of Maine. I also support ranked-choice voting in particular because because it creates space for candidates outside of the two-party system and because I believe we need more democracy and more choice, not less.\Debbi Perkins (R)\Did not respond.\Senate District 6\Marianne Moore (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\I believe we need to take a comprehensive look at our workforce and ensure that Mainers have the skills needed for today's jobs. I know there are many jobs available that require technical skills our young people lack. We have to encourage more of them to learn the trades. We also have to do more to attract industry to Maine.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The people have spoken on this issue, and I do believe we need to expand Medicaid. But we need to find a reliable funding source for it. That's going to require rolling up our sleeves and getting creative. Perhaps tapping the tobacco settlement fund would be a viable option.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\I believe we need to take a look at the system, as a whole, and come to a conclusion about who should and shouldn't be on welfare. Clearly, we need to care for the most needy among us. For able-bodied adults, it should not be a way of life. I also believe there should be a work requirement for able-bodied citizens receiving welfare as part of an ongoing effort to move them away from the welfare system and into the workforce.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I would support some borrowing to address needs with our infrastructure and higher education.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I support the expansion of renewable energies in Maine. But as a Washington County resident, I am concerned about offshore wind development. If we are going to pursue these projects, we have to ensure they do not interfere with marine life and our fishing industry which is so important to our economy.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am pro-choice and do not favor additional restrictions, although this is, for the most part, a federal issue.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will not vote for Question 1, and I encourage everyone in Maine to vote no. There are multiple problems with this proposal, the biggest being the costs. The way I understand it, there are no means tests or residency requirements for those who would benefit from passage of this ill-conceived idea. People I've been meeting with while campaigning are very confused about this proposal.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do not support ranked-choice voting. It's very confusing, and frankly, unnecessary. We will be asking Maine citizens to use two different voting systems when they go to the polls on November 6. I think this is wrong.\Christina M. Therrien (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Lack of adequate infrastructure. Invest more in transportation, broadband expansion, support airport, rail, and shipping improvements\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Maine people have supported the expansion and it should be funded. To determine the best way to fund the expansion would require a full review of what is currently being funded and where the revenues are being appropriated towards the operation of current government. I don't think it is wise to propose where the funds should come from without looking at the whole picture.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform means to evaluate all social programs currently being provided and look for efficiencies, duplication of services, and fraudulent activity, whether within the state or amongst the program recipients. It can be a chance to provide a better service to those in need and while looking for beneficial savings.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes, infrastructure is a vital component of the state and improvements must be made if Maine wants to continue to compete in the global economy. Businesses must have internet access and the ability to move goods/services in a cost effective manner. I am willing to consider different revenue sources to improve infrastructure.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. We should be working to reduce our carbon footprint and negative impact on the planet.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Neither at this time. I am pro choice.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\For. It is more cost effective to keep citizens in their homes whenever possible and most people want to be at home and not in nursing facilities. We must pay people who do this work a fair wage.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. I believe that whoever serves the people should have the majority of the vote.\Senate District 7\Louie Luchini (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Among the biggest challenges to our economy: building our workforce, keeping/attracting young people in Maine, and lowering healthcare costs. We must develop a 21st century economy that creates good-paying jobs with benefits. We can continue investments in R&D and commercialization, support small business and start-ups, and expand broadband to all parts of Maine. Increased investments in pre-k to adult education will help prepare our workforce, making licenses/credentials more accessible.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Maine people have approved Medicaid expansion and it's the Legislature's responsibility to budget for it. Expansion will help rural hospitals by reducing the enormous financial burden of charity care, which forces hospitals to shift the cost to those with private insurance, or balance their budgets by making job cuts. The legislature needs to prioritize expansion in the biennial budget process. A potential source of funding is the millions received annually by Maine's liquor contract.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Social services programs should help Mainers that are truly in need. Reforms should focus on a more efficient delivery of services, while rooting out any welfare fraud. Removing the ""cliff effect"" will allow people to ease off the programs. Our social services programs must focus on lifting families out of poverty, helping them find work and healthcare, so they can eventually leave the programs entirely.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maine needs to make serious investments to improve our roads and bridges. Bonding is an option for investing in infrastructure, but we should also make larger investments through the biennial budget process, maximizing federal match dollars.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Maine should encourage and incentivize the use of renewable energy, such as hydropower, solar, tidal, wind, and biomass. Not only will this help our environment, but it will create jobs and increase economic investments in Maine. We should be leaders in off-shore wind, utilizing UMaine's research. Biomass continues to help our struggling forestry/logging industries. Maine should incentivize conservation of energy by weatherizing homes and using more efficient sources of heat, like heat pumps.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I believe current law is sufficient, and I don't believe politicians should make personal health care decisions for women.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I have not taken a position on Question 1 yet.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I have supported a constitutional amendment allowing RCV in all Maine elections.\Richard S. Malaby (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Long term our biggest barrier is high costs- for taxes, electricity and regulations.\Short term largest barrier is need for additional workforce.\Legislature could try to lower taxes and energy costs and promote workforce development while making the state more business friendly.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Funding should be included in the budget if it is a priority. Frankly, the lack of skilled, trained eligibility specialists is an immediate impediment to expansion. The department needs 27 people to achieve normal case loads for specialists (700 cases per staffer). We would need an additional 100 to expand by 70,000. This is a complex job, requiring knowledge of Federal law, significant computer skills and a great deal of training. I just do not see it happening quickly.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\It has a variety of meanings but for the most part people tend to think of it as eligibility for state paid services.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. While I do not favor a blanket increase in the tax, I could see increasing it if the price of oil falls below a certain benchmark figure-say $2.00 a gallon statewide wholesale. Conversely if the wholesale price stays above that, then I would eliminate the increase in the taxes. I suggest a modest tax increase if that price is below the benchmark.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I have no problem with renewables, but I do not think the state should be subsidizing investments that do not make economic sense.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Neither\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will vote No-it is a sham. Yet another poorly crafted referendum.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No-I can not see the need for a constitutional amendment for this issue.\Senate District 8\Kimberley Rosen (R) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\The popular quote ""demographics is destiny"" applies to Maine's economy. Employers are wrestling with the challenge of dwindling numbers of working age people. The Legislature should re-design all economic incentives to restrict the benefits to rewarding job creation, attraction and retention, with preference to small Maine based businesses. Also, voters must soundly reject ballot questions like Question 1that drastically increase Maine state tax rates.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Dedicate a portion of the revenue from the sale of liquor, tobacco products and marijuana to fund the Medicaid eligibility expansion as well as providing an increase of resources targeted to add more addiction treatment and recovery services.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Establish as our top priority the safety net of services for children, the elderly in need and people with disabilities as well as people designated as class members in negotiated consent decree settlements. Services for people looking for temporary support should be tailored to individual circumstances and transitioning off these services should be tiered step by step rather than an abrupt all or nothing cliff.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Borrowing adds interest expense to the overall cost of projects. The additional public funding required to retire the debt results in fewer miles of highway improved. Prudent adjustments to the gas tax will generate direct funding for transportation projects and is preferable to incurring costs associated with heavy borrowing, providing the public and overall economy more bang for the buck. Utilizing debt should be reserved for extraordinary circumstances that require maximum flexibility.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Incentives should be equalized across all renewables including hydro, solar, wind, tidal and geothermal. The current overall level of incentives to encourage investment in renewable energy sources is sufficient but the state should apply them evenly and fairly rather than pitting winners against losers.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Current state laws are appropriate.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting No on Question 1. The 30 pages of new law in this proposal will hurt not help Maine people and damage the Maine economy. It includes the largest tax increase on Maine working households in the history of our state. It creates a shadow-government board with no direct accountability to the taxpayers of Maine. The proposed new law violates personal medical privacy and violates the Maine Constitution.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I did not support the ranked-choice voting experiment. I think a run-off process is preferable because voters would easily understand the choices before them. However, the voters have decided the question and rank-choice voting is the law we must operate under. Therefore as Senator I respect that outcome and support sending out for voter approval the necessary constitutional fix required to implement the law.\Beverly B. Uhlenhake (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Roads, rail, and waterways used to be the route for goods and services to be exported out of the state of Maine. Now, much of that commerce exchange happens fully or at least in part over the internet. We have the Three Ring Binder developed; we need to pull the stakeholders together, fund it, and implement it. This is especially important in rural Maine.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\First, we need to understand that if we don't fund Medicaid expansion, we'll need to soon bail out our hospitals who are struggling due to the number of uninsured seeking treatment. Once we realize that we are paying for it no matter what we do, the money will be much less painful to find.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\As I've talked with Mainers in this district throughout the campaign, not a person expressed a desire to completely eliminate welfare. We all agree that we need a safety net. That safety net must be accessible, fair, and easy to understand. It also must be appropriate in the amount of assistance available and safeguards against abuse.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\On many other issues, we hear that those that use the service should pay for the service. At some point, we need to get over our fear of a gas tax increase. We are paying for infrastructure whether it be through bonds or through an increased gas tax. It's best coming from those who use it.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\The State of Maine should invest in the research and development to make these technologies more accessible and affordable to the general public. This is exactly the public/private partnership that needs to be negotiated.\We also need to invest in weatherization projects throughout Maine to address the other side of the energy equation. We need to reduce the use, but we can't do that as heat pours out through the cracks of some of the oldest housing stock in the nation.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I had a great-uncle who happened to be a Catholic missionary priest in Peru most of his life. At the end of his days, he expressed his belief to my grandmother that abortion would happen no matter the legality of it. It is our job to help women stay safe in the process, and we can't do that in an unregulated market.\I'm also of the firm belief that we need to do all we can to prevent abortions - access to education, reproductive healthcare and birth control are vitally important.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\We know that helping the elderly stay in their homes for as long as possible is more effective, more efficient, and more dignified than the alternatives. But tax reform via referendum is a bad idea. I'll be voting against this referendum, but I will work toward better options for home care when I get to Augusta.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. I agree with the League of Women Voters (who originally presented this idea in the early 00s) that ranked choice voting leads to more civil campaigns and less need for strategic voting. Ranked choice voting really does offer more choice and more voice to voters.\Senate District 9\Geoffrey Gratwick (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\There are several barriers to our economic development: a.) A broken, much-too-expensive health care system that is ruinous for both businesses and individuals. The Legislature must create a new structure that emphasizes prevention, accessibility, lower prices for medications, a public insurance option, and simplicity; b.) Lack of high-speed internet throughout Maine; c.) We need to keep our young people here with programs that create more and better jobs. Also, we need carefully designed tuition forgiveness programs, paid family medical leave, and pre-K programs.\[image id=""2708688"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\As a physician I have been a leader in the effort to expand Medicaid for the past eight years. Expansion will provide preventative and other medical care regardless of income for those it covers. Healthy citizens are productive citizens. States that expanded Medicaid after 2008 have done better economically than those that have not. Expanding Medicaid will bring $525 million in federal monies per year at a cost of $25-30 million of state funds.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\It means we have to fix the rules so public assistance is a safety net, not a generational life style. We need to modify the current 'cliff' which causes recipients to lose all major benefits (MaineCare, food stamps, housing) when their income increases by a small amount. Benefits should be tapered, not abruptly shut off. If people work more, they need to know they will take home more money and escape the cycle of dependency.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Our parents paid the taxes and fees which built the infrastructure that now supports our economy. We should make sure that we do the same for our kids. Roads, bridges, ports, clean water, sewers, and public facilities are essential. High speed internet, the economic highway of the future, has now joined this group of essential public services. Funding should come in part from user fees, in part from public funds but largely from bond issues.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\In a time of rapid technological change, the relative role of wind, solar, gas, renewables, and petroleum will clearly change. We do not know what Maine's energy mix will be even ten years from now. A constant is our need for conservation, weatherization and smart transportation: these must be as much a priority as the cost per kilowatt hour of electricity. The technology of energy storage is evolving and will undoubtedly lead us down new and currently unknown paths; Maine must study and rapidly adopt new options.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Abortion should be rare, safe and legal; it should not be a state-by-state option.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Caring for our elderly at home makes social and medical sense. Question #1 has introduced us to the idea of funded home care. Eventually we will look back and wonder why we did not adopt it earlier. I am concerned that, as currently written, the referendum has not been sufficiently vetted. There are too many unanswered questions and too many decisions will be left to the legislature; these decisions will invariably be resented. For this reason, I will not be voting for it. However, the issue is of paramount importance and should move forward; the legislature must iron out its details beforehand, with the benefit of widespread public input and hearings.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\James LaBrecque (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\As an inventor, technology specialist and businessman for 45 years, the lack of technically trained minds coupled with unrealistic expectations of the young is irresponsible. Legislators should relax their dominant push for liberal arts college and emphasize the critical need for technical training in a growing complex and technologically advanced society. These are the most lucrative jobs for many future graduates.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\This is another case where liberal extremists engage in a referendum to hijack and circumvent the legislative process of public hearings. Legislative public hearings with input from citizens and experts is paramount to fair and successful legislation. Bangor incumbent democrats voted together to deny our second district voters an equal voice in allowing such referenda on statewide ballots. How is this in our best interests? Their party votes were against their obligations to represent us.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare is a statutory obligation to meet the basic physical and material well-being of people in need. Welfare reform to me means, assuring that the limited resources for those truly needy are not abused by those gaming the system, like those using welfare money for gambling, booze, cigarettes and pot. Welfare reform should mean better identifying those people who are in most need for safe and healthy environments, not entertainment.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. Adjust the tax rate as needed to meet the needs. Let those who benefit most from the infrastructure contribute more in taxes for maintaining them. Too many private initiatives are allowed to greatly profit from special rules and back room deals whereby taxpayers end up paying more so others can profit. Increase transparency so that all citizens know what is going on. Revisit exorbitant contracts and renegotiate for more honest and fairness. We have seen President Trump do just that.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\No. I know of no other industry that has relied on pushing their product for 45 years through hundreds of special, state and federal laws still in effect today. No additional amount of new laws will result in fulfilling future promises anymore than they succeeded in past performance over the last 45 years. We know Angus King and others made millions from taking advantage of government subsidies. Why would we want to allow others to make millions more off tax and rate paying consumers?\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Any changes in legalized abortions must be addressed by the Supreme Court. Abortion laws are on the books. A woman has a right to choose. I would wish the baby and father had rights as well, but currently the baby in the womb has no voice. There is science regarding at what point a fetus is able to live without the mother. That is a discussion I would like to see advanced. I believe more education and information should be available to the public at large.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\No. Again, this is another case where out of state liberal extremists engaged in a referendum to hijack and circumvent the legislative process of public hearings. It is an additional 3.8% on certain Maine families. Maine's businesses and economy will be devastated by this tax, wait lists for home care will be out-of-control because there is no means test for this program, and the privacy of our seniors and disabled will be at risk. Why would anyone want to vote for this? I certainly will not.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No. One man, one vote. Majority rule. These are tenets of our electoral process and remains the ideal way to choose our elective legislators. RCV simply takes the majority vote, if not over 50%, and forces a second tally where a less capable candidate could steal the election. Leaders and legislators should win based upon their principals, character and experience, not on a popularity contest. This is not high school. RCV was not legally funded and a mistake favored by out of state interests\Senate District 10\Bill Lippincott (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Our educational system is not keeping up with the needs of our 21st century economy. We need to have quality education across the state, starting in early childhood; teachers are one of our most important assets, and we need to retain and attract good teachers to our state. We also need to have affordable vocational education and community colleges to train workers in the skills of the new economy.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The federal government still picks up 90% or more of Medicaid expansion, and the population that is covered by Medicaid expansion tends to be less expensive than others on Medicaid and Medicare.  Money from the $35 million tobacco settlement would take care of some of the costs; we should look at what other states are doing or planning, including surplus revenue in the general fund, tapping into tax revenues such liquor sales, making hospitals help, or cutting other Medicaid costs.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\We need to have a system that enables low-income single mothers a chance to escape the cycle of poverty. There has to be an incentive to take a job without putting a family in worse straits and a transition time before all benefits end. Affordable daycare and vocational training are essential components for any program to get people back into the workforce\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. As vehicles become more fuel efficient, gas taxes have not kept pace with the cost of maintaining roads and bridges. Two alternative methods should be looked at: the total yearly mileage of a vehicle, and the impact that class of vehicle has on the wear and tear of our roads. I don't foresee the elimination of bonds in the near future as a method of funding, but other sources should be examined\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\The state should encourage renewable energy. I agree with 97% of climate scientists that global warming is happening and the cause is an increase in greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. It's imperative for our children's future that we switch to renewable energy sources, such as solar power, and this presents an great opportunity for economic growth as demand for renewable energy increases in Maine and New England\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy, including a safe and legal abortion. I also recognize that health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and so also reduce the need for abortions\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\We need to support home care for seniors; Maine has an aging population and home care costs about half of what it would cost to house someone in a nursing home, with a much higher quality of life. But I don't support doing this by referendum; I would like to work on legislation that looks at different funding mechanisms, and looks at what other states are doing as models for what we can do in Maine\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Not at this time. I would like to see how well ranked-choice voting works in the US Senate and House races this fall before I would support a constitutional amendment\Stacey Guerin (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Work force shortage and lack of capital investment are two of our biggest barriers to improved economic growth. Attracting and retaining workers and capital investment can both be helped by lowering our taxes. We are the third highest state in the nation in tax burden. People and companies are comparison shopping on this costly issue.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\CNBC reports our tax burden is 11.02, the third highest in the nation. Clearly, we should not raise taxes to fund expansion. That leaves us with the question of where to reduce spending in other areas such as transportation and education, neither of which I wish to reduce, to pay for expansion. I want to be clear, Medicaid Expansion in no way affects our senior citizens. We must lower healthcare costs for ALL our citizens. More coverage choices would reduce everyone's healthcare costs.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Putting able-bodied people back to work and preserving our resources for the truly needy is welfare reform. Working gives people a sense accomplishment and a hopeful future. Mainers are known for being self-sufficient, welfare reform encourages that spirit. My own ""Casino Intercept"" reform bill has transferred nearly half a million dollars to overdue child support payments from parent's gambling winnings.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\The poor condition of our roads and bridges is a important issue to my constituents. I support moving away from our current funding shortfall system which leads to repeated borrowing with interest. One possible solution would be to apply the 150 million dollars collected in vehicle sales tax to the highway fund. This would give the transpiration department enough funds to virtually eliminate borrowing. Let's make the condition of our roads a priority!\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Renewable energy resources are important. I encourage both individual and corporate investment in these resources.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\When I was a young women, we were told that a developing fetus was a blob of tissue. Thanks to the advances in medical science, most of us have now seen a pregnancy sonogram. We now know it is a baby, capable of feeling pain. I am pro-life.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I join all of our gubernatorial candidates, regardless of party, in opposing Question 1. It is unconstitutional, extraordinarily expensive and unsustainable.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I believe in one person, one vote. I do not support discarding votes, thus denying the votes of Maine citizens. I also have serious concerns about the cost incurred and security of ballots being transferred away from local oversight.\Senate District 11\Erin Herbig (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Having met with more than 100 businesses in Waldo County this year, I can definitely say the greatest barrier to economic development is a trained workforce. The best employee in the world is a well trained Maine worker. The legislature needs to expand vocational education in high schools and the community college system, particularly in the trades, healthcare and the composite industry, so people can get the training they need without having to travel far from home.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The legislature has already approved a bipartisan proposal to fund this mandate which is awaiting the Governor's signature. Medicaid expansion is critical for the sustainability of our rural hospitals as well as the ability of our healthcare workforce to provide direct care to all Mainers.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\In Maine, we look out for our neighbors. That means having programs to support people who are struggling. It is also important to recognize the money used to fund these services comes from hardworking Maine families and we owe them the responsibility to make sure programs are run efficiently and effectively, and are available for those who are truly in need.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. Rather than borrowing money, routine road and bridge maintenance should be direct line items of the budget. Borrowing money for maintenance is not fiscally responsible and leaves rural Maine behind.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Mainers have always been independent and our energy policy should be too. Renewable energy diversifies our energy demands, and diversification is an important part of any investment strategy. We should encourage the expansion of these emerging technologies through tax and policy development.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Our current abortion laws carefully balance the rights and interests of all people. This is an important part of women's healthcare that should be decided between a woman and her healthcare provider.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\While I certainly agree with providing more support for Maine's seniors and Mainers with disabilities, I do not believe the funding mechanism outlined in this referendum is the best way to proceed. I am committed to working with my colleagues as chair of the Aging Caucus and other interested parties to find solutions to this issue that are right for every Mainer aging in the community they love.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Voters already approved this by referendum and the legislature has a responsibility to make sure it happens. I've heard from an overwhelming number of my constituents who support this measure and I am committed to seeing it through.\Jayne Crosby Giles (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Maine needs a skilled and ready workforce. Employers that I spoke to this past year often said that finding able employees is their biggest challenge. My ""Learn Here/Live Here"" program focuses on inspiring our next generation to launch their careers in Maine by supporting the following legislation: expand career & technical training across Maine, develop business & tech incubators to encourage entrepreneurs and connect rural Maine to better & faster broadband networks.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Medicaid expansion should be funded in the next biennial budget without gimmicks or ""one timeÄ funds. The state has a $7 billion biennial budget. The proposed $50 million expansion is .7% of the total budget which we should be able to afford. Additionally, Wellness incentives encouraging people to live healthier, quit smoking & increase exercise should be woven into our Medicaid program. Only 3% of national health care costs are spent on prevention & wellness. Healthier living will reduce costs.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\We all deserve a chance to be successful. Sometimes people need a helping hand due to illness, job loss or other unexpected event. Unless disabled or elderly, government assistance should be temporary with a goal that recipients become financially & emotionally secure. As example, Family Development Accounts (FDA) help low income families budget and save. Enrollees may receive a 4:1 ""match"" up to $5000 for education, home purchase or self- employment. More programs like FDAs help others succeed.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maine wisely pays off bonds for roads & bridges within 10 years. By repaying the debt relatively quickly, Maine stays ahead of the ""useful life"" for bridges & roadways. When I served on the Maine Legislature's Appropriations & Financial Affairs committee, we carefully watched how much debt the state carried in relation to the amount of General Fund revenues that the state receives. I recommend that this approach continue.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Investment in renewable energy technologies is smart investment for Maine's future. The legislature should encourage additional collaboration with our neighbor Canada that has made significant investment in clean, renewable energy sources. Investment in the businesses and organizations that provide clean energy should include a long range plan so that these enterprises become economically viable & sustainable over time.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I recommend no changes to the current abortion laws. Roe v Wade was decided in the 1970's and is accepted law. My utmost concem is for the pregnant woman and that she have access to proper care and support as she decides what is the best course for her family & her family.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\While I support ways to help families take care of their loved ones, I do not support Question 1 for several reasons. The revenue raised by the tax increase does not have adequate legislative oversight with the funds being managed by a separate board. Plus, the 3.8% tax hits many Mainers, including, doctors, dentists and nurses. These are medical professionals that we need, especially in rural Maine, to provide services. I recommend that the legislature take a closer look at the issue in 2019.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I support having the next legislature review the results of the 2018 elections before expanding RCV further. The June 12, 2018 primary was the first election in which RCV was used in Maine. After the primary, when visiting voters during my door-to-door campaign, I found that there is still a lot of confusion on how RCV works. More voter education is needed and evaluation of the 2018 before RCV is expanded.\Senate District 12\David Miramant (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\We need to embrace people from all over the world to fill our workforce with those willing to work. We also need to support broadband expansion in rural areas and continue to train our workforce for the jobs that are available. These are all happening, but not to the levels necessary to support the demands.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I have a bill request in the Revisor's Office to fund the Medicaid expansion at 50 million dollars. That will leverage the 500 million that the federal government will contribute thereby reducing the money wasted on high cost emergency room visits, or folks suffering with health issues that could be addressed. This is what the voters have decided and we need to make it happen. This should be expanded to include all Mainers and take our healthcare out of the hands of insurance companies.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\It means examining the use of the funds spent on our social programs to make sure they are being administered fairly and efficiently. We have the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability (OPEGA) that has that role in Maine government and I have supported funding in the past and will in the future. We have been doing that whenever we can and the results have shown that fraud and waste are a rare exception.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Definitely. This is a problem we wrestle with constantly on the Transportation Committee. It is such a waste of money to bond and pay interest when we know we are not meeting our needs. We have had several suggestions such as increasing the gas tax, a per mile charge at re-registration or a dedicated road use fee at registration. We need to bring all the ideas together and work it out in the committee since it is a challenge that will need broad agreement to pass.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes, The real costs of burning fossil fuels are being ignored and those emissions are having serious consequences on our health. There is abundant evidence of climate change and the the need to stop the pollution caused by combustive generation of power. We have endless offshore wind resources and unlimited sun for solar generation. The cost for solar has dropped by 60% in the last 8 years. The companies selling and installing solar are creating good paying jobs that can't leave the state.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\The law is in place and needs to be honored. No legislature should be allowed to undermine the law and make it unusable.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will continue to make the hard choices on the bills facing the Legislature and I will consider the question for myself when I go to the polls. This is certainly an issue we need to address in Maine and I am grateful that the referendum is giving attention to that need.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes, this is a way to have our choices considered throughout the voting process. It also creates a more civil campaign since the ranking of candidates seems to correlate with those who run more positive campaigns based on issues instead of attacks.\Wendy Pelletier (R)\Did not respond.\Senate District 13\Dana Dow (R) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Taxes are too high when comparing to other states. Too many businesses choose to go elsewhere instead of here. Proof: K-12 student population in our schools has decreased 25% since 1970 (240K to less than 180K) as young families have moved out of state.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I'm against dedicated funding sources. Full Legislature needs to address the same as any bill that compete for limited monies. The solutions must pass the Legislature and survive possible vetoes. This process will assure a stable outcome.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Basing the changes on a sliding monetary scale. Some jobs pay less than total benefit packages and at a certain income, welfare falls off the cliff. Needs a scale to encourage people to go back to work. Welfare is meant to be temporary.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Revisit the gas tax amount. Paying at the pump is better than borrowing and interest continually. Need to investigate per-mile registration fee for low-mileage cars. Everybody needs to pay their fair share.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Not a fan of ugly wind power. Should maintain research and development of solar power so that costs will eventually be reduced. Solar power locally also will reduce transmission costs compared to long distances from powerplants.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I would keep the same.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\NO. A very poorly worded initiative fraught with errors. May contain unconstitutional methods of obtaining personal health information. The administration of the funds is not responsible to the government or any legislative agency.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Undecided. Is it necessary? The first trial showed delayed time of picking winners at an extra expense, yet not one single change occurred from normal plurality method in use.\Laura A. Fortman (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\We need to invest in our people (education/skills) and our infrastructure (including broadband). We need to make sure that we expand our labor force by recruiting and retaining workers and investing in education at all levels, including vocational technical training. Also, we must invest in our roads, bridges, and broadband. This will create good paying jobs in the short term and provide dividends for business and Maine people for decades to come.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The Maine voters decisively supported Medicaid expansion. Implementing it needs to be a top priority. For every dollar that Maine spends on Medicaid expansion, we will receive nine dollars from the federal government. Medicaid expansion will not only support critical health care services, such as treating substance use disorder, it will shore up rural hospitals by reducing charity care and help create new jobs. If necessary, general fund revenue can be used to fund this expenditure.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\While knocking on doors I have had many conversations about ""welfare reform"". I heard repeatedly that most people don't mind helping out a neighbor when they are struggling. I also heard broad support for job training, child care and making work pay by expanding the EITC- things that improve self-sufficiency and reduce poverty. There was deep compassion for children, folks who are aging, or have a disability. Also, everyone agrees - people who abuse the system need to be held accountable.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I believe that Maine's current practices make sense to meet our immediate needs. Major investments in our roads and bridges are needed now and interest rates are low. However, more and more bonds and ever increasing gas taxes can't be our long term answer. Maine is not the only state grappling with this issue. This challenge calls out for a national blue ribbon commission to make recommendations. Failing that, Maine should undertake a study of our own.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I believe that energy policy needs to transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources. I believe that expanded incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies would be appropriate, but the nature and extent of those initiatives needs to be worked out in the legislative process. Finally, we need to improve efficiency and conservation efforts.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support the right of Maine women to access safe and legal abortion, as codified in the Maine Reproductive Privacy Act, and oppose any legislation that limits the right of a woman to make the best decision for her health.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I support the intent of Question 1. Lincoln County is the oldest county in Maine. Developing a long-term care system that meets the needs of older people so that all of us can maintain our independence as we age is critical. The legislature must address this and, if elected, it will be a top priority for me. However, I have concerns about several elements in Question 1 including the proposed funding mechanism and the governance structure. Therefore, I will not be voting for Question 1.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. Again, the voters of Maine have spoken clearly in two separate referenda that they want Ranked Choice Voting (RCV). It was used successfully in some primaries this year. Also, I believe that RCV can help reduce the negative rhetoric in campaigns which would be a very good thing.\Senate District 14\Shenna Bellows (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Infrastructure. Maine is a great place to live, but lack of infrastructure including high speed, reliable Internet, cell phone service and transportation can make it a tough place to start a business. We need to think boldly about building infrastructure, especially technology, as a recruitment tool to attract and retain young people to live and work in our state. Last session I proposed the creation of a public-private partnership to match private and public investments in broadband statewide.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Medicaid expansion is an incredible bargain. Maine will receive approximately $9 from the federal government for every $1 we spend at the state level to provide healthcare to an estimated 70,000 additional Mainers. Revenues are strong, and I'm proud that we have run a budget surplus. Now is exactly the time to invest some of that surplus in access to healthcare for more Mainers. In the long run, we may save money in overall healthcare costs when more people can access preventive care.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\To me, welfare reform means working in a collaborative and bipartisan way to ensure that the truly needy, especially our seniors, children and people with disabilities, have adequate food and housing and that everyone who can work does work.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. While Governor LePage's Administration has done an excellent job with maintaining our highways, our broader network of local roads and bridges needs more attention. I support restoring revenue sharing to provide more support to cities and towns for local road and bridge maintenance. Investing in transportation infrastructure is a huge economic development tool to create good jobs.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes, the state should expand incentives for renewable energy because it's good for the economy and good for the environment. Energy independence is crucial to growing our economy and protecting our state security.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Maine's laws are well established protecting the freedom of women to make their own decisions about abortion free from interference from the government. I support current Maine law protecting access to abortion and will do everything in my power to support women's access to a full range of reproductive healthcare.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will respect the will of the people, whatever they decide. I have serious concerns about the details including implementation and funding. My mom is a home healthcare nurse, so I know how important home healthcare is to Mainers, and I support the goal of the referendum, but I think the details need to be more carefully planned and thought through.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. The people of Maine have endorsed ranked choice voting at the ballot twice. Amending the Maine Constitution to return it to its original wording and allow ranked choice voting will ensure that the people are heard.\Matthew William Stone (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Our high energy and healthcare costs combined with an oppressive tax and regulatory structure make Maine an extremely difficult state to do business in. We need more legislators who have private sector experience and understand the economic struggles of both workers and small business owners. I worked for many years at a credit union, helping families and small businesses solve their financial problems. I'm the only candidate in this race who truly understands the economic challenges facing us.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\We need more adults in the room in order to solve this problem. Ideological considerations, whether conservative or progressive, need to be left at the door. Medicaid expansion is what voters wanted, so it's what they're going to get. The most pressing problem to solve is the long term viability of the program. There's no sugar-coating this: we're going to have to either raise revenues or cut other programs. Once elected, I'm going to listen carefully to my constituents on how to proceed.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform is about restoring trust in a vital and necessary public system. Even mere rumors of welfare fraud undermine social trust and hurt our communities. It's important that our assistance programs are focused on helping the truly needy of our native population: the disabled, single parents, poor elderly, etc. If able-bodied young adults fail to find direction in life, perhaps it's time the state provides it for them in the form of volunteerism or infrastructure projects.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. As the hybrid and electric car industry markets continue to grow, we must re-examine how we raise revenues in order to maintain our roads and bridges. I look forward to studying this issue further and exploring solutions with all stakeholders.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Maine is well-positioned to become a leader in renewable energy technologies, whether it's in the form of hydro, solar or offshore wind. If Denmark can get 42% of its energy from wind, then so can Maine. For too long, the fossil fuels industry has been able to suppress green energy initiatives through the buying of politicians. As a proud Clean Election candidate, I support expanding renewable energy options, as long as costs aren't passed on to ratepayers.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\While I believe Roe v. Wade is settled law, I sympathize with those who morally object to abortion on the basis that it's a violation of the sanctity of life. I strongly support the right to safe and legal abortion in the cases of rape, incest, life of the mother, certain genetic disorders, and even socioeconomic circumstances, but I also oppose taxpayer funding of abortion and ""abortion on request."" Even the UK, India, and Japan ban the latter. It's something to consider.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\No. The tax increase alone would drive middle-class working couples out of state and destroy small businesses, further shrinking our tax base and leading to even worse home care for our seniors. There are also potential HIPAA violations in Q1. Even Janet Mills has come out against this referendum. I was disappointed that my opponent declined to answer ""yes or no"" to this question in a survey with another paper. It's important that our political leaders give straight answers to these questions.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Maine's constitution is based on Massachusetts' constitution, which was written by John Adams. I believe he knew what he was doing when he wrote it. I will not support any amendment that meddles with the fundamentals of our representative democracy, including the grossly unconstitutional and so-called ""ranked choice voting.""\Senate District 15\Matthew Pouliot (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Finding skilled employees to fill positions is the primary concern I hear from employers in Maine. To grow our economy, we must ensure that Maine residents are trained with the skills needed for the jobs of today. Supporting career & technical education as well as programming at Maine's post-secondary institutions is necessary. We also must get serious about attracting people to Maine with incentives to reduce student loan debt through tax credits that match principal pay-down on loans.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Funding should be addressed through sustainable sources. We must make sure that we do not end up in a situation where we are not able to pay our bills like before.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Ensuring that welfare programs are utilized to help people get a hand up without becoming a long-term handout. Many people do not want to be on welfare, but need certain programs to get by in the short-term and that is ok. Yet for some able-bodied adults it has become a way of life to sustain themselves through social service programs and that is not ok. We must provide these individuals with valuable training and opportunities to improve their skills so they can become gainfully employed.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. As vehicles become more and more energy efficient, the outdated model of using the gas tax is not sustainable. Technology exists to track the amount of miles driven by a vehicle, we should look at implementing a pay-per-mile system as a more equitable way to fund our infrastructure.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes, as long as the incentives implemented do not burden ratepayers. Beyond the environmental imperative, it makes sense to use energy that is renewable because diversifying our energy portfolio provides an opportunity to become more and more energy independent. As technologies improve, the ability to reduce costs and dependence will prove to be beneficial for all Maine people.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I will continue to work to maintain the sanctity of human life.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Against. It is an imprudent way to fund the issue of home care in Maine.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No. I am hearing from many of my constituents that it is confusing and they feel it should not be in place for any elections.\Kellie Julia (D)\Did not respond.\Senate District 16\Scott W. Cyrway (R) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Maine is facing a workforce shortage. There are not enough workers for the jobs. Sadly so many young people are unable to lead productive lives due to the use of illegal drugs. I think we need to help our young people to make good choices in life so that they can help reduce the workforce shortage. Those good choices might be to avoid drugs or to take more technical courses, but the most important thing is that we encourage young people to stay in Maine and participate in the workforce.\[image id=""2708689"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Since the voters approved Medicaid expansion, we need to be sure that it is funded. In the past when expansions were funded, a huge debt to hospitals was created. Paying off the hospital debt is one of the best things the state has done recently. We need to make sure that Medicaid is expanded responsibly and that the people on the waiting list are served. We do not want to rob Peter to pay Paul.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\I have spent my life trying to help those in need and protect children. Welfare reform means ensuring we help those in need while also helping people help themselves with resources available. It means protecting all of Maine children, no matter their background. Welfare reform means making sure that help gets to those who really need it. When money is handed to those who could do without, we have less for those who are relying on these programs.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Bonding might not be the best way to fund our roads. Cars get much better gas mileage than they did in the past and that means that there isn't as much money coming in from the gas tax. We should look to see how other states have dealt with this to find a way that works for Maine. Our roads are so important that we need to be sure that the cost is fairly distributed.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Incentives are a great way to encourage starting industries. Solar and wind costs have gone down significantly and they need to find a way to be self-sustaining as they continue to be part of the plan for Maine's energy needs. We can't afford to jeopardize industries that are trying hard to bounce back.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Abortion is a federal issue that the Supreme Court has addressed. I am not planning to introduce any bills relating to it, though I am personally pro-life.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I am voting ""No"" on Question 1. Question 1 has the potential to force families and small businesses out of Maine due to high taxes. While it may be well intended, this bill wouldn't target Mainers who really need the help and would harm middle class families. Maine cannot afford to become the highest taxed state in the country. If re-elected, I will work with my colleagues to help make home health care affordable for Mainers in a responsible way.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do not support it. I believe in one person, one vote. The process has proven to be more expensive than expected as we saw in the primary process when there were over $300,000 in unfunded costs.\Karen Kusiak (D)\Did not respond.\Senate District 17\Jan Collins (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\The two most important factors affecting economic development are education and infrastructure. Broadband internet, cell service, well maintained roads and bridges; and skilled workers who can problem solve attract business investment in our communities. We need to insure proper funding for both. The legislature must assure that the state fulfill its obligations to fund schools. Tax cuts to the wealthiest Mainers during the last 8 years have prevented investments in rural Maine infrastructure.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Maine has missed out on over 1.5 billion dollars in federal investment and the 6000 medical jobs those funds would have generated. Every rural hospital in the state is struggling under deficits caused by the number of patients who lack health insurance. The legislature should review the three tax cuts it has made in the last six years to a very narrow segment of the population and consider new revenue streams as identified in the 2009 tax study.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Reform means better meeting the material and physical needs of Mainers. To do so, the economy in Maine must grow. To increase work force participation and maximize employment in an ever changing economy, we must have the ability to train and retrain. Job training for the unemployed and underemployed should be vigorous and targeted. It should be done in partnership with employers and should include supports that make it possible for parents of small children to benefit, such as, childcare.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maine should revisit how it funds infrastructure creating a reliable source of revenue to avoid the current poor condition of many of the state's roads and bridges. Revenues from the gas tax and/or bond initiatives, vary according to the strength of the economy. The need for road repair, however, is predictable. Infrastructure investments should be a regular part of the budget and funded from the general fund.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Incentives encouraging solar power should be expanded. Solar expansion boosts local economies. Solar provides local jobs in sales, installation and repair. It creates energy independence, slows the accumulation of greenhouse gasses, and provides clean energy. Solar energy can be stored. Wind power cannot be stored, adds few jobs to the local economy, and requires transmission lines. When placed on mountains, turbines require the mountain top be blasted.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I believe the current laws regarding abortions strike the right balance.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Maine is the oldest state in the country. We have a shortage of nurses, homecare workers, senior housing, and specialized alzheimer care facilities. We have known the current crisis was coming and have failed to plan appropriately. As I travel around the district I am struck by the number of people who are struggling with the health care needs of an aging parent or partner. They can no longer be ignored. Question 1 is flawed, elder care must be addressed by the legislature.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections. Ranked choice voting insures that the candidate with the broadest support wins. Candidates opposed by a majority of voters cannot win.\Russell Black (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Maine has made tremendous progress in the last eight years by lowering taxes and reducing regulations, but these remain among our biggest obstacles. We need to fix our referendum process so out of state groups are not bankrolling citizen initiatives with proposals that will raise our taxes. I would support legislation to require an equal number of signatures be gathered from both congressional districts in order to get a referendum question on the ballot.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The people have spoken on the issue of Medicaid expansion, but we need to find a sustainable funding source for it that doesn't rely on gimmicks and one time funding sources. We have to remember that we are expanding a welfare program to able-bodied adults. Meantime, Mainers with mental and developmental disabilities continue to languish on waitlists for services. I believe they and other truly needy Mainers need our attention.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare should be approached as a hand-up, not a hand-out, and not a way of life. The ""T"" in TANF is short for ""temporary."" There will always be people in our society who need help during tough times, but the goal should be to move them out of the system and help them become productive members of society.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I think we should revisit how we fund infrastructure projects and believe that when possible, we should fund such projects within the state budget instead of asking Maine taxpayers to borrow money.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Simply put, we need to support policies that bring the most cost-effective power to Maine for our businesses and homeowners. I support renewable energy sources such as solar, biomass and hydro when they are affordable, efficient, and make sense.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am pro-life.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\No. Rather than help those in need, Question 1 will create more waitlists for our elderly to languish on, while handing a large budget to a new bureaucracy with very little oversight from taxpayers. It would also make Maine the highest taxed state in the nation. All four of Maine's gubernatorial candidates oppose Question 1, and that should tell voters all they need to know about it.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I would not support this. Ranked-choice voting violates the principle of ""one person, one vote."" And while it seeks to have a candidate win by a ""majority,"" it's a redefined majority by a ""winner"" after some candidates are completely eliminated from the ballot. There's also the issue of the cost of ranked-choice voting, which was greatly underestimated during the June primary, forcing the Legislature to come up with more funds to pay for this convoluted voting scheme\Senate District 18\Lisa M. Keim (R) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Maine's increasing lack of skilled workforce has already begun to cause economic stagnation. We need to keep young people in Maine and attract more here. Marketing to young families with Maine connections and offering incentives is a good place to start. Also, our family structures continue to crumble. Strong families create productive members of society and healthy, vibrant communities. The state should sift all policies through this lens.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Everyone needs health care. We need to find a way to ensure Mainers have access to it, but government-run health care is not the way to go. Maine expanded Medicaid already, and it took years to pay off the hospitals because the state lacked the money to keep up with costs. The Legislature needs to find a stable source of income to pay for this before expansion moves forward. Most doctors and dentists feel it is essential that some amount of co-pay be required of every person.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Most of us, at one time or another, have fallen on hard times. Maine needs to have a safety net that helps people get back on their feet, but it cannot become a way of life. Our priorities should be helping our truly needy, such as the elderly and Mainers with disabilities. I support the recent reforms Republicans backed to crack down on welfare abuse in Maine.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I have been supportive of some borrowing to fund infrastructure projects and funding for our colleges. However, I believe we should limit our borrowing and find resources within our budget for other initiatives.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Maine needs affordable, reliable energy sources in order to compete with other states and attract businesses and families. I support renewable energy sources to the extent that they make sense, financially and environmentally. However, we cannot push higher electricity bills onto low and middle-class Maine ratepayers to subsidize renewable energy initiatives.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\All life is sacred. As medical science continues to advance, what was once considered only 'human tissue' may now be a viable birth. Maine would do well to make adoption a more accessible option for women who find themselves in this difficult situation.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\The four gubernatorial candidates and the Maine Chamber of Commerce, among many others, all recognize this is bad for Maine. It's a scam, and it would make Maine the highest-taxed state in the nation. There is plenty of Q 1 information in print and online. I urge readers to do their research.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Ranked-choice voting has already caused many problems. First, the Maine Supreme Court ruled it's unconstitutional for state general elections. Now Maine uses two different voting methods. This is confusing. RCV is costlier, less secure, and leaves voters in doubt of outcomes for a prolonged period. The Australian people I've quizzed give a very different picture of how this system plays out over the years. I am convinced that RCV does not improve outcomes and do not support expansion.\James Wilfong (D)\Did not respond.\Senate District 19\James Hamper (R) - Incumbent\Did not respond.\Michael McKinney (D)\Did not respond.\Senate District 20\Eleanor Espling (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Maine has record low unemployment and increased state revenues, thanks to sound fiscal management over the last eight years. Businesses that struggled during the recession are seeing more economic success in Maine. When I speak with big and small business owners, the biggest issue they are facing is finding people to work. Workforce development will be a key priority in the upcoming session. Maine can do more to recruit workers as we have so much to offer as a state.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\While I have concerns about the long-term budget consequences of expanding Medicaid, it can only be funded within the scope of the budget. This will require the Legislature setting priorities and making hard choices. A responsible budget would be one that does not increase taxes and does not take money out of the rainy day fund.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform simply means helping the truly needy by ensuring those dollars go to providing for basic needs. A successful welfare program is one that moves someone from poverty to prosperity. The success of a program is one that moves people from dependency to independence, not arbitrarily eliminating people from a program but really working with people to get them back on their feet. We all need help from time to time.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\We all use Maine's roads and bridges, so I would like to see it a higher priority in using general fund dollars in the highway budget. We take in revenue from multiple taxes on cars and trucks which just goes into the general fund, never to find its way into the highway fund budget. We can do better at funding our infrastructure maintenance costs.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\First we should assess what alternative energy technologies make the most sense in Maine. I have always been open to alternatives in making sure our energy portfolio is as diverse as possible. However, it should not be done at the expense of taxpayers or ratepayers.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support laws that are both good for the woman and her unborn child. I support a woman having all the information she needs to make an informed decision understanding the other options she may have available to her for support should she want to give birth to the child.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\As a legislator who was named ""Advocate of the Year"" in 2015 by the Home Care and Hospice Alliance of Maine, I have worked across party lines on home care issues. The Legislature has made home care a priority, so to say we need to invent a new system of delivering that care is unreasonable. The tax will also be detrimental in attracting the young professionals we need in our state to provide care when we already have a worker shortage.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do not favor changing the state constitution to enable ranked choice voting. Proponents knew it was unconstitutional when it was put on the ballot. If they were truly concerned about the constitutional problems around the initiative, they should have sought to amend the constitution first.\Ned Claxton (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Maine needs an expanding workforce that is ready to maintain what we have and to grow in new directions. There are not enough trained workers now to meet the current needs in the trades - plumbing, electrical, etc., and we need more well-trained and trainable workers to take on new work. To be successful, we need to encourage people to move to Maine, promote strong apprenticeships options and have good job training resources in place for those workers interested in additional training.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\There appears to be adequate funding to initiate the Medicaid expansion – a funding bill was passed but then vetoed. After the first year's costs, funding needs to be part of the biannual budget considerations. How to fund the expansion should be part of a healthy discussion of Maine's priorities and funding ability.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\All of our welfare programs need periodic assessment to make sure they are accomplishing the purposes for which they were created. Each program needs to be compassionate, focused and effective or it needs to be revised. Reform should follow evidence of under-performance. Just as individuals should be held accountable for their actions, programs should be held accountable to their goals and outcomes.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\We need a new way to fund infrastructure funding. Along with many other states, we need to explore options that factor in vehicle weight, miles traveled and vehicle value, to name a few factors. How would a 1% increase in the state sales tax compare to the shrinking revenue from the gas tax? Would that be acceptable to Mainers, given a substantial contribution from out of state visitors? Dedicating those dollars to state and local road repair could decrease the property tax burden.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\We need to continue to develop renewable energy as a step toward lower cost electricity in Maine. This is a key step in moving toward energy independence, decreasing our fossil fuel dependency, and creating a healthy and clean environment to foster economic growth. Newer technologies and infrastructure improvements have been the focus of incentives. In the past. Solar, water and wind are no different. They should be expanded to help avoid degrading Maine's special environmental qualities.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\The Supreme Court of the United Sates has ruled that access to abortion is legal and a protected constitutional right. Therefore, we should work to assure that all Maine women have equal access to this health care service. That access needs to be supplemented with ongoing education and other efforts to decrease unplanned pregnancies and to promote adoption as an alternative to abortion.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\While I completely support the goal of helping caregivers make a livable wage as they do the important work of keeping people in their homes, I am voting against Question 1. The funding mechanism - a one-time fix for a specific issue, does not address other important state needs. We need to avoid creating a relatively independent, quasi-governmental entity to manage this revenue. This benefit should go only to people who most need it and not to everyone. We need further discussion on funding.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes, based on what the voters have said, we should amend the constitution to allow for ranked choice voting in state elections. There is evidence that this process may improve the civility of our elections – something we sorely need. We should respect the voters' wishes and give it a fair try.\Senate District 21\Nathan Libby (D) - Incumbent\Did not respond.\Nelson M. J. Peters, Jr. (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Lack of qualified workers is the biggest barrier. The Legislature can do at least two things to assist. First, remove all but the most essential barriers so entrepreneurs can thrive in a Maine economic environment. Second, make trade school education inexpensive and easily available to all who will remain in Maine and work.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\All approved referendums come with a cost. The legislature cannot raise taxes to pay for every new program, it just isn't possible. Other budget items must be cut to pay for the new program. If the Legislature can't make the cuts then the Governor should have the authority to cut line items from the budget to balance the budget without raising taxes. I think this also helps the voters to set priorities.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare should be a temporary safety net for those in real need of assistance. Reform is to assure that welfare doesn't become a way of life. We certainly should give people a hand up when needed and help them to regain their independence from the need for welfare.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maintaining infrastructure should not rely on one form of revenue. The funds from the gas tax should go into the general fund and additional general funds may well be needed to assist to pay for the upkeep of the infrastructure. Bonding is a useful technique if used properly but it must be remembered interest is paid on that money borrowed. The Legislature needs to set priorities to pay for what is necessary.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Remove barriers and add incentives to move all of us toward renewable resources. It is just the right thing to do.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\The law is this area has become quite settled over the last 30 years. I would suggest we encourage the private sector to provide options and opportunities for women who might wish to have a child adopted as well as expand the opportunity for birth control and education.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Against. Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Wathen said it's deeply unconstitutional in many respects. The Chamber of Commerce says it ""over-promises and under delivers."" This legislation is ill-conceived.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No. Everyone gets just one vote.\Senate District 22\Lois Kilby-Chesley (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\There are many intertwined threads why Maine's economy has remained stagnant. As a career teacher I see the primary need to invest in education. Research provides a plethora of information on the benefits of early childhood education, adequately funding PreK to grade 12, and providing access to higher education. Without a strong educational system we will continue to fall behind our neighbors. We also need to work to maintain, and grow, our working population through sustainable development.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\There is funding available right now that could get Medicaid expansion started through May 2019. Once the new Legislature is seated it will become imperative to assign dedicated funding to continue helping Mainers in need. This should have begun on July 1, but up to now more than 3500 Mainers have been denied. Again we see evidence of ignoring the will of the voters through the Governor's veto of $60 million that was allocated by the Legislature.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\In order to reform programs it is important that access is available to the neediest families - a target we often miss. After the economic disaster in 2008 more families with children were drawn into the system. In Maine 1 in 4 children qualifies for free/reduced lunch, an indicator of the severity of the needs. We must be consolidating services to give youngsters and families the leg up to improve their opportunities for success.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I have never believed bonds were the way to fund infrastructure of roads and bridges in Maine. Over the 10-year life of the bond we pay millions in interest. Just like in our own finances we have reached the point when we should be spending 'real' money not depending on bonds. Getting there will hurt in the short-term but be beneficial in the future. I do support raising the gasoline tax to help raise the necessary revenues.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I am a proponent of solar and off-shore wind energy. Providing incentives for renewable energy is one way to encourage development of an alternative energy grid. I am opposed to CMP's transmission line from Canada, through ME to MA. Maine needs to view the long-term impacts, and providing incentives now will put us on the path to sustainable energy.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I believe that every women has the right to make decisions for her body, her well-being, her family, her sexuality, including reproductive rights. Choosing an abortion is already a difficult decision and restricting a woman's choices would force us back to a time when laws decided for us. I believe that every woman has the right to own her body.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting for universal home health care in Maine. At the present time I am personally aware of the problems of home assistance for elderly and disabled Mainers. Care for those who want to stay in their homes, in place of a nursing home, is currently unregulated and quality care is hard to find. Q.1 would make home health care a profession and raise the standard of care.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Ranked choice voting has proven it works. The required constitutional amendment is the necessary next step to expand it to state general elections.\Jeff Timberlake (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\In the last eight years, under Republican leadership, we made the largest tax cut in state history and reduced burdensome, unnecessary regulations. But much more work needs to be done in order for Maine to compete with other states, as well as reduce wasteful state spending. I will advocate for more tax relief for Maine's families and small businesses. We also need to reform our citizen's initiative process to prevent outside groups from forcing Mainers to vote on expensive tax schemes.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\My first priority is helping Mainers who are truly in need, including those with mental and development disabilities who remain on waitlists for services. I believe we should focus on them before paying for health insurance for able-bodied, childless adults who would be covered by Medicaid expansion. If we are going to go through with Medicaid expansion, we need to find a way to fund it without raising taxes, dipping into our rainy day fund, or using one-time budget gimmicks.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\In recent years, the Legislature has made significant strides in cracking down on welfare abuse, despite attempts by Democrats to block these reforms. I am not opposed to having a safety net for those who fall on hard times, but we cannot afford to make welfare a permanent way of life for able-bodied Mainers. I believe in the principle of ""a hand up, not a handout."" All of our efforts regarding this issue should be focused on guiding people out of the welfare system and into the workforce.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I am generally opposed to borrowing money for projects that we could pay for with existing resources in the state budget. However, in the past I have supported transportation and other infrastructure bonding in order to maintain our roads and bridges. I have also supported bonding for our colleges in order to help keep our young people in Maine.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\In order to be competitive, Maine needs dependable and cost-effective sources of energy. That means expanding our capacity for natural gas and hydro power throughout the state. I am not opposed to alternative power sources such as solar and wind, as long as Maine ratepayers aren't expected to pay for them. In order to be competitive, alternative energy needs to be affordable.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am and have always been pro-life. I don't agree with public funding for abortion, but this is largely a federal matter. I am more focused on improving our economy, lowering taxes, and bringing more jobs to Maine.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\All four of Maine's gubernatorial candidates have come out against Question 1, and that should tell us all we need to know. It is an ill-conceived, costly idea that would make Maine the highest-taxed state in the nation. I encourage everyone to lean more by visiting stopthescammaine.com.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Ranked-choice voting is a hot mess! Maine's Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional at the state level in general elections, so we're now only using it in primary elections and for federal offices in the general elections. This is extremely confusing to the voter. RCV violates the principle of ""one person, one vote,"" and doesn't even guarantee the ""winner"" gets the majority of the vote. Further, the cost of ranked-choice voting for the primary in June greatly exceeded initial estimates.\Senate District 23\Eloise Vitelli (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Biggest barrier is our workforce. Our population is shrinking; we are getting older. We need: to attract younger people; a workforce that is skilled & prepared for global economy. Legislature's role: fund education, pre-k to post-secondary, quality training for existing & future workforce; support public-private partnerships e.g. Maine Spark & goal of 60% of Mainers with credential of value by 2025; make health care available & affordable for all ; affordable housing & expand broadband .\[image id=""2708690"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The Legislature had identified funding within the existing budget, including surplus revenues, to get Medicaid expansion implemented and through the first year. Keeping in mind that state spending draws down significant federal funds, the process for funding Medicaid going forward is the same process used to fund any state spending obligations. The state has to balance its budget; in the future, Medicaid will be considered for funding along with all the other priorities.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Our social services programs are designed to assist those in need who, through illness, disability, loss of income , family/ life circumstances, are unable to provide for themselves the necessities of living. Welfare reform is what we should do to be sure our programs are serving individuals in need with respect and dignity, are helping them identify and take steps towards greater personal responsibility, holding individuals accountable while providing them appropriate support and guidance.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\As vehicles become more efficient, and as we move away from total reliance on gas to fuel our transportation, yes, we will need to come up with alternative ways of maintaining our existing transportation infrastructure than the current gas tax. I don't know what the answer is, but I am in support of taking a look at innovative ways we might resolve this issue – sooner rather than later.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. We need to move past our reliance on carbon based fuels. increase our use of alternative, renewable energy sources and in the process, create jobs and businesses that will employ Maine people and reverse the negative impacts on our environment.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Access to abortion should be protected for all Maine women. Currently, women in rural areas and low-income women, specifically those on Medicaid, are limited in their ability to access an abortion should they choose to do so, either because of distance or cost. I am in favor of taking steps that would ensure all women have access to these services.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\There is a clear need for home care services. Helping someone stay in their homes is less expensive than taking care of them in an institution.. I am not, however in favor of this initiative. The proposal should have had a hearing before a legislative committee. Developing a complex new program, & a new tax , would be better done in consideration of the broader context of how to best provide services , how we train and compensate workers providing the care, & how we pay for these services.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\If what is required to fully implement ranked choice voting for all elections within the state is a constitutional amendment, yes. I would support that.\Richard Donaldson (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\High taxes are not conducive to attracting new business and skilled workers to Maine. The legislature must work together to reduce taxes on small businesses and working families to encourage economic growth.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\We need to find a way to pay for expansion without raising taxes or using one-time gimmicks. Our inability to pay for Medicaid expansion in the past resulted in enormous hospital debt. We can't go down that road again.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\To me, welfare reform means providing a safety net for those who are unable to help themselves, while also providing assistance to help people climb out of poverty. I will be a watch dog to ensure that our tax dollars are used wisely and not wastefully.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maintaining our infrastructure is critical to Maine's citizens and economy. I am always willing to look at new funding proposals, however I believe that we cannot afford to solve this problem by raising taxes.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Maine's energy costs are among the highest in the nation. I support incentivizing renewable energy here in Maine through tax credits and low interest loans but I do not believe we should pass this cost on to the ratepayers.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I would not change the current Maine laws surrounding abortion.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Maine doesn't need any additional taxes to lead us to become one of the highest taxed states in the nation. I believe that we need to make home health care affordable for those who need it but this initiative is not the right approach. I will be voting no.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I wouldn't support a constitutional amendment for ranked-choice voting. The costs are too high and the last gubernatorial primary proved that the benefits are marginal.\Senate District 24\Everett Brownie Carson (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\There are two: Lack of a skilled work force to fill jobs that are open, and the high cost of health care for employers who want to provide it for employees.\We must step up funding and capacity for vocational training at the high school level, and also align skills training at community colleges to the jobs that are and will be open to workers.\We must design and implement a health insurance program that makes quality, affordable health care accessible and affordable for all Maine citizens.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\There are sufficient funds now in Maine's Medicaid account to move forward with expansion--we need to do it. Both voters (by ballot initiative) and the legislature have approved expansion. Healthy citizens will be more productive, and will particiapte more actively in the workforce and in community life. There is NO reason not to move forward.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\To ""reform"" welfare should mean that public assistance programs provide support services: such as education and skills training, substance abuse treatment, mental health counseling, transportation (as needed to get to a job or medical appt.), and quality child care (as needed), so that recipients have the bast possible opportunity to reach their potential as productive citizens. We need to get away from the approach of penalizing people who need assistance and services.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Absolutely. Annual borrowing for transportation infrastructure means we pay the extra cost of interest on each bond. We can and should raise the over-the-road fuel tax, so that our revenue stream meets our needs. When we have a large, specific project (i.e., new bridge over a major river), then borrowing/bonding is justified. We need to improve the condition of our transporytation (and broadband) infrastructure to promote economic development in all regions of Maine.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Solar is the best example today of clean, renewble power. Expanding solar capacity will bring clean, renewable energy to Maine while creating good jobs that cannot be ""exported."" Our laws, such as limiting the number of participants in a community solar project, are badly outdated. Prices for electricity will be more stable over the long term with clean, renewable solar and wind--making incentives a good deal for Maine people.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I believe that a woman should have unrestricted access to reproductive health services, including abortions, provided by competent, licensed medical practitioners. A woman's choice about whether to have an abortion should be a decision that she makes in consultation with her doctor.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will vote ""no."" While I fully support providing home health care for seniors and adults with disabilities, I do not favor constructing such a program outside the structure of a well-integrated, thoughtfully designed comprehensive health care system. Creating and funding such a system is a tall order, but Maine needs to do it, and we all should participate in designing and paying for it.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. RCV is the best way, short of a run-off between the two top vote getters, to elect the candidate with the broadest support among voters. It may also dampen negative campaign practices over time, but the jury is out on that effect.\Diana Garcia (R)\Did not respond.\Senate District 25\Catherine E. Breen (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Two items: workforce development and access to the internet. We need to make strategic investments in early childhood education through higher education to build a workforce ready for the global economy. And we need to continue to facilitate the deployment of internet access in underserved parts of Maine, where we have enormous potential for local agriculture, aquaculture and many other Maine-based entrepreneurial opportunities.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I co-authored the bill that funded Medicaid expansion and met all of the governor's subjective conditions. And he vetoed it. We have a surplus and we don't need to make cuts or raise taxes to fund this. There is no funding problem. Furthermore, expanding medicaid will bring in hundreds of millions of federal dollars into Maine's healthcare system. Return on investment is $1 state funds = $9 federal funds.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform means smart, targeted investments, based on data and evidence, that help Maine people move from poverty to economic security and dignity.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. Without any substantial federal transportation funding coming to us, bonding is the most practical way to fund these critical needs. Especially when interest rates are so low, as they are now.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Maine's geographic attributes position us well to take advantage of solar, off-shore wind and tidal power research and development. And climate change - caused by fossil fuel consumption - is already changing the Gulf of Maine in ways that threaten our fishing economy. We can and we must enact policies that give incentives to businesses and homeowners to move away from oil and toward renewables.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Every Maine woman needs and deserves safe, affordable access to a full range of health care services, including cancer screenings, birth control, and abortion.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\While I appreciate our responsibilities to our elderly and disabled family members and neighbors, this bill is not the best way to address this critical challenge. I will be voting No.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. I was the lead Senate sponsor of this bill in the 128th legislature. I will continue to support the will of the voters.\Cathleen Nichols (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Keep the referendum process out of tax issues. We cannot compete with other states to find workers because our income taxes are too high. Pass legislation to prevent outside interests from funding efforts to pass bad laws. Toying with our tax rate creates an unstable and unreliable economy that discourages growth & reduces the ability to increase wages. Both parties see this problem but still can't agree on a remedy. Assess Maine's incentives for attracting workers & getting people back to work.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\We need to find the proper funding and ensure this won't bankrupt our hospitals again ($75 million). Health care should not be mandated, and a variety of care should be available in the free market. Health care costs for lower income earners should be reduced at an exponential rate, not at a flat rate which kills a work incentive. Also the cost of health care for others should not increase to compensate for the subsidized health care of others. Taxes should not be the venue for this program.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform is including incentive programs for working when social support it provided. There are light work and part time opportunities available for those with physical limitations. Not everyone is employable of course, and I hope that the assessment process to evaluate if people qualify for social services is accurate and under constant review.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes. We should eliminate duplicate administration whenever possible, such as merging the MEDOT and Maine Turnpike Authority. Also, our toll fees are not competitive with other states. Much of our maintenance and infrastructure needs are a result of Maine's visitors; we should re-assess if the use:pay ratio is appropriate.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Incentives must be effectively targeted & likely to reduce rates for all ratepayers. I support renewable energy, especially when it is home grown, & I support energy efficiency such as heat pumps, LED lighting & computerized air motor controls. Maine's energy problems are that others are benefiting more than us. Our power delivery costs from CMP are the highest in the nation; they have a questionable service record, a monopoly on Maine's energy market, & are owned by a company based in Spain.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Not until we determine if there is enough support for preventing unwanted pregnancies, in particular with substance abuse. We should investigate successful programs used elsewhere, whether it be better access to birth control or educational incentives that would reduce teen & drug-related pregnancies. I believe if girls were physically active we might see fewer teen pregnancies. If there is a correlation between daily PE classes & improved mental health, we'd see girls making better choices.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Against. This CI will bankrupt our state. There are 4 existing agencies that effectively and conscientiously support home-care. This CI has no income limit and would allow non-residents of Maine to qualify. Moreover, in violation of HIPAA, this proposed bureaucracy would disclose the personal information of all people who are eligible to receive in-home care support. People in nursing homes would not qualify. Workers would automatically become government workers and pay state union dues.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No. RCV marginalizes my vote for my chosen candidate because it allows multiple choices (which are additional votes) to another voter. I don't believe that everybody's second choice should be the first choice winner. One voter, one vote, and whomever gets the most votes wins. An election should be won by a candidate who'd beat all the other candidates head-to-head.\Senate District 26\Bill Diamond (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\The state must be more supportive to our existing businesses and provide incentives to attract new businesses.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Funding options have been established, but the Legislature will have to compromise and the governor will need to provide leadership.\[image id=""2708691"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform should be defined as appropriate assistance to those in genuine need with built-in incentives to help get people off the system.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Absolutely! DOT now depends of borrowing $100M a year just to complete their biennial budget. Mixing General Fund and Highway Fund budgets should be examined.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes, renewable is the answer to our long term energy solutions.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support the laws that we currently have are sufficient.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I'm voting NO. This is one of the most destructive proposals we've seen on the ballot in a long time. The negative impact that this will have on small businesses and middle class families is substantial.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No, RCV is costly to implement, doesn't guarantee any candidate will end up with a majority of the vote. This system will be even more cumbersome if both political parties are required to put their candidate through the process unlike what happened in the June primary.\Senate District 27\Ben Chipman (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\We need a multi-pronged approach to economic development. We must start with embracing New Mainers as a key to addressing our challenges. A recent study found that New Mainers pumped $1.2B into the Greater Portland economy in 2016. In Portland, our chief barrier is workforce development – so we must invest in skills training programs. I sponsored legislation this session to provide training for New Mainers. In rural Maine, we must create more incentives for people to start businesses.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I have been a strong supporter of Medicaid expansion, and there are already ample funds in the account to get the program started. In the longer-term, repeated studies have shown that in states where Medicaid has been expanded, there has not been an increase in state spending. Taxpayers already foot the bill for people without healthcare who utilize the emergency room. Medicaid expansion will decrease these costs and will also lead to the creation of 4,000 jobs and additional revenue.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\When I hear the term ""welfare reform,"" it is most often in the context of legislation that would increase the hurdles for people seeking to access social safety net programs. Having grown up in a low-income, single-parent household, I know what it is like to go without basic necessities – and I don't believe anyone should have to.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I do believe the state should revisit the way it funds infrastructure projects. We should not be borrowing money for basic infrastructure needs, because it unnecessarily costs the taxpayer for the interest we must pay on such borrowing. I would instead prefer to fund regular maintenance of roads and bridges as part of our ongoing expenses in the state budget. High-quality roads and bridges – not to mention rural broadband – are crucial if we want to attract the business we need to grow.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes, the state should absolutely expand incentives for renewable energy technologies. I strongly supported bipartisan legislation that would have created 600 jobs in solar energy throughout Maine, but Governor LePage vetoed it. We should resubmit that legislation with a new governor. Maine should be a leader in solar and wind energy, but right now we are lagging behind the rest of New England. This is a shame, and I will continue to push for investing in renewable energies.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am proud to be endorsed by Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America, and I will always stand with women and defend their right to make their own reproductive health choices. I believe we should be doing everything we can to protect and expand reproductive healthcare, and that the government should play no role in telling women what they can or cannot do with their bodies. As a Senator, I have worked to defeat all efforts to restrict reproductive freedom.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting for Question 1, because there is clearly a need for more home care services for our elderly and disabled populations. Maine is one of the oldest states in the country and we must provide our senior population with the services they deserve. If Question 1 passes, I will work with the legislature to ensure that the tax threshold only applies to single individuals and not to married couples or businesses. I will also work to ensure the complete privacy of home care patients.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes, I support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting for all Maine elections. As a member of the Portland Charter Commission, I brought ranked-choice voting to Maine and I have defended it at every turn. I believe that ranked-choice voting ensures greater representation for people's electoral choices and that it should absolutely be applied to gubernatorial and legislative elections.\Crystal Canney (U)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\We need to do more to support our small businesses either through innovative programs that attract an educated workforce or incentives that show a direct return on investment. I have talked to a number of small businesses in Portland and most will tell you healthcare costs keep them from being financially able to expand. Affordable access to education is also important to develop the educated workforce. We must start addressing the costs of higher education.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\While I believe the next legislature and Governor will implement the will of the people - if for some reason it doesn't happen we have to reprioritize the state budget - while living within our means - we can still seek out efficiencies and work towards funding healthcare.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\This is a politically charged question and unfortunately only asked from the viewpoint of the parties. Right now in Maine, Independents or unenrolled make up the largest percentage. That said, welfare reform to me - means getting what is needed to people who have no other options. There are definitely people who need services without question, however, we also need to have a basic standards test as we can't pay for those who might be able to be more self-sufficient. It is a balance.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Because vehicles are more fuel efficient we have seen in the gas tax. Increased user fees are one example of how to increase revenue. It will take a myriad of solutions including working with our Washington, D.C. delegation to prioritize this issue.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. I am supportive of increasing tax incentives for renewable energy. It is part of a larger picture around climate change. A recent United Nations report on climate change reveals serious changes to the earth within the next 12 years. Maine and everywhere else will face repercussions from climate change. Solar and wind are part of the solution - and wind where it makes sense to do these projects - are a piece of that larger discussion.""\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I believe it is a decision between a woman and her doctor on this issue. I support the continuation of Roe v Wade.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I support increased services for our elderly without question. I think this question and process is bad. The question allows a non-legislative board to oversee the money. If passed that board would not be accountable to you or me - financially. This is another case of a ballot measure in reaction to failure in Augusta. The legislature needs to prioritize the elderly and fund these programs through a state budget. If it passes however, I will absolutely support the will of the people.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do. Every election season - we hear the cry of ""spoiler"" when it comes to independent candidates. Let's take the argument away - by having Ranked Choice Voting - and just elect the best people to lead our state. There are now more independents in Maine than members of either party. Twice citizens have voted in favor of Ranked Choice Voting and Augusta has failed to deliver.\Senate District 28\Heather Sanborn (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\As our population rapidly ages, we need more young people to move to Maine so that economic growth can continue. The legislature can support this effort with student loan debt relief, high quality public schools, and early childcare programs that will attract young people to move to Maine (or stay in Maine) as they begin their careers and families. We should also enact policies that welcome immigrants from all over the world and help them to quickly become valuable members of our workforce.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Medicaid expansion will end up being a net positive for our state economy, pumping more than $450 million federal tax dollars back into our economy each year. Expansion states realize savings in other areas of their budget – particularly in addressing the opioid crisis – by utilizing Medicaid expansion to address critical health needs. With current revenues running far above budget projections, the funding is available right now to implement Medicaid expansion and we should do so immediately.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform ought to mean that we're being thoughtful and creative about addressing the root causes of poverty and that we're being proactive in addressing the needs of individual needs of Mainers who are struggling to make ends meet. This includes ensuring that low-income Mainers have access to high-quality health care (in part through Medicaid expansion), and that they have the food, shelter, transportation, child care, and job training that they need to lift themselves out of poverty.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Yes, the state needs to revisit the way it funds infrastructure. The revenue collected through gas taxes are dwindling due to fuel efficiency gains, but also in large measure because the gas tax is not indexed to inflation and has not be raised in many years. A task force should be put in place to consider indexing the gas tax to inflation, imposing a progressive road usage fee that is tied to the value of the vehicle, assessing a fee for annual mileage, and other creative approaches.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\We must move beyond fossil fuels so that we can slow the climate change that is already dramatically impacting our lives – as our ocean warms and storms impact us with increasing frequency and strength. Right now, our state's policies disincentivize the adoption of solar power. We should repeal these disincentives, such as the size limit on community solar farms and the new scheme that allows CMP to charge homeowners for ""delivering"" the solar power that they generate and use in their own homes.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Women should have access to the health care that they need and should be allowed to make their own choices about that health care, including access to safe, effective abortions. Maine laws generally recognize this principle and should continue to do so regardless of any further efforts to undermine Roe v. Wade.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will vote against Question 1. I believe that complex social programs and tax policy are best hashed out through the legislative process, where public hearings, stakeholder processes, and careful attention to detail make for better outcomes and fewer unintended consequences. I am in favor of Mainers being able to stay in their homes as they age and would work on legislation that provides more supports and incentives to help make that possible.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Yes. Ranked-choice voting ensures that the will of the voters is respected and that candidates with very marginal support cannot up-end the outcome of a close election.\Senate District 29\Rebecca Millett (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Making higher education affordable is key to strengthening Maine's workforce. Our economic viability hinges on increasing the size of our population with high-quality college degrees, certificates or other credentials. To help students afford higher education, the Maine state grant needs to double to $3,000 to maintain its original purchasing power. We must continue to invest in the Opportunity Maine Tax Credit to attract and retain college graduates by providing some relief from student debt.\[image id=""2708692"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I voted to fund expansion this past session along with a majority of my legislative colleagues. The bill went to Governor LePage, who continued to ignore the will of Maine's electorate and vetoed the funding. His obstruction of implementation was aided by House republicans who voted to sustain his veto. Should I have the privilege of returning to the Senate, I will support a similar bill and get on with providing 70,000 more Maine citizens with health care\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Welfare reform is about making sure that we are strategically targeting our resources toward building economic stability and opportunities for success for low income Mainers. Mainers are proud, hard working, and want a chance to contribute to our communities and have healthy families. Our job is to make sure there are no disincentives or roadblocks to ensuring Mainers opportunities to build better lives.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Current borrowing is unsustainable. The federal gas tax was last adjusted in 1993, has not kept up with inflation, and is dwindling as a source of funding. With more gas efficient, alternative energy sourced vehicles on our roads, continuing to rely on a gas tax will further degrade our roads and bridges. We need to have honest conversations about these challenges, the importance of maintaining our transportation infrastructure, and the options available including vehicle weight and usage fees.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\For generations we have consumed fuels that leave a legacy of environmental degradation for our children, including contaminated groundwater from strip mines, ocean acidification, and polluted air. As a species, we have damaged our planet more than any other living creature, but we are in possession of better technologies to reduce our impact on the environment and should be using every opportunity to bring those forward for our children's and grandchildren's future.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I oppose any attempt to weaken women's reproductive freedom. The decision to become a pregnant is a profound and personal decision that should be made without political interferenc\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I am not weighing in on Question 1. Voters can obtain objective information on this and other ballot measures through the Maine League of Women Voters at this link: http://www.lwvme.org/guide.html. As always, I will respect the will of Maine's voters.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I voted in support of LD 1624, proposing an amendment to the Constitution of Maine to determine the winner of elections for the offices of State Senator, State Representative and Governor by ranked-choice voting and to send the amendment to Maine's voters. Undermining the will of Maine voters is undemocratic. A majority of Mainers voted for ranked-choice voting and should have an opportunity to weigh in on a constitutional amendment.\George Van Syckel (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Excessive taxes and regulations\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Set up a Go fund me page for Democrats want to contribute more. In a free society you do not use government to force financial extraction on a group of people to fund your own pet projects.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\Empowering opportunities for self help building self respect and self worth.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Set up a go fund me page for Democrats to contribute more.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\No! Let private enterprise develop it. Wind power will never cover even it's initial investment and scars the countryside, just look at Aroostook County. That money should have been used as matching funds for single or small group use.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Education should be done through out childhood development, that life only comes from life. It is not the man's or the women's body, it is the baby's body in and out of the womb. Under 18 requires parental permission. Individual Counciling by Rev, MD, JD, and Ph.D. before Abortion. Nothing after 1st Trimester. Restricted. I am Pro Life.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I am against para-government taxation. I am against Question 1.\I hope to initiate an emphasis in Senior care by promoting investors and pre purchasing retirement living. This will free up desperately needed housing for the younger generations. Elder care could be our greatest need.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I am opposed to a constitutional amendment that would allow Rank Choice Voting . I strongly believe in one citizen with a picture identification , one vote. This last election was proof ranked choice voting is a scam.\Senate District 30\Amy Volk (R) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Workforce. With a growing economy, now is the time to make ME a welcoming place for young workers by controlling what we can at the state level: incentivizing affordable workforce housing, lowering income taxes, continuing to provide direct property tax relief with the fairness credit and improving adult ed, community colleges and universities. We also need to find ways to encourage employers to hire workers with disabilities, the recovery community and people with criminal records.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\I supported Medicaid Expansion after the voters of my district approved it, but funding is a challenge. I hope there are savings in our current budget to be identified by the next administration. We need to consider managed care, as well as implementing co-pays for emergency room visits and prescription drugs. Work requirements are under consideration in several states, including New Hampshire. We should look at equalizing taxes on non-tobacco smoking products as a possible source of revenue.\[image id=""2708693"" size=""half"" pos=""right"" /]\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\""Welfare reform"" means that taxpayer dollars are spent effectively to guide people to independence. Effective reform must take a ""whole family"" approach, addressing child care, transportation, education and job training, particularly in our rural areas, increasing the capacity for parents to provide and care for their families independently. When Maine began enforcing TANF time limits, we saw recipient incomes rise 237% in 4 years. Work/training requirements for SNAP yielded similar results.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I would not mind seeing Maine capture more use taxes (non-commercial tolls) for roads and bridges, particularly May-October. In general, I believe our seasonal residents and visitors should be shouldering more of the tax burden in Maine. I have worked on tax reform that would broaden our sales tax and I continue to support doing so in order to create a more predictable and fair system of balancing our state budget.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\The federal government already provides high subsidies to wind and solar, per MWH produced. ME should instead support hydro and biomass, which provide key base load power to the grid. Biomass and hydro are easily adjusted to meet demand. The additional benefit of biomass generation is the market created for waste wood and the sawdust byproducts of our forest-related industries. By contrast, wind and solar are unreliable electricity sources, fine for residential, but not helpful to industry.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Choosing to end a pregnancy is a major decision and one that may stay with a woman for a lifetime. I believe that women should, at minimum, have every opportunity to make a completely informed decision. This includes being offered an ultrasound and/or information on fetal development.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I do not support Question 1 because it puts many hard-working, middle class, double income families into one of the highest income tax brackets in the country to pay for the care of any disabled or elderly person in Maine, regardless of income or even residency status. Additionally, the quasi-government entity it would create to oversee this care would not be accountable to elected officials and would likely violate HPPA law.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\I do not support increasing the scope of ranked-choice voting. Ranked-choice has already cost Maine taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars while we were struggling to find funding to increase the pay for and number of DHHS case workers. I would prefer to see that money used for any number of better causes, including student debt relief, drug treatment, preventive healthcare, state salary increases, etc. The needs are great. We cannot afford to be spending extra money counting ballots.\Linda Sanborn (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\The biggest challenge facing our community is the lack of opportunity for young people to find quality jobs and raise a family. The challenge of affording higher education and then finding work that pays a fair wage forces young people to move out of Maine. Career and technical education programs lead to good jobs with steady wages and benefits, and the legislature needs to fund CTE programs to make sure that the training students receive keeps up with changing needs in a changing economy.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Implementing an expansion of MaineCare is essential to the health and well-being of Mainers, and Maine's economy. As the legislature demonstrated multiple times during the most recent legislative session, there is sufficient funding available to expand MaineCare, especially given that this expansion will leverage significant federal matching money into the state to help provide care for the 70,000 Mainers left without access to a doctor by Governor LePage and his legislative allies.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\True welfare reform moves people out of poverty and allows them to become more self-sufficient. We must create opportunities for education and training, so that people can get a good job, take care of their families, and be productive members of the community. Supporting programs like Parents as Scholars, that help struggling families get the education they need by assisting them with child care or transportation, have proven to move families out of poverty.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Our current cycle of borrowing to pay for roads and bridges does not do nearly enough to articulate a long-term vision for building Maine's infrastructure. We need sustainable revenue plans to pay for that infrastructure, and we need to increase our understanding of the infrastructure Maine needs, moving beyond roads and bridges and into high-speed internet access for all of Maine, transportation options that don't rely on single-passenger vehicles, and updating our aging wastewater facilities.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Of course we should. Not only is reducing our CO2 emissions a moral imperative to attempt to stem the tide of climate change, but investing in clean energy is great for Maine's economy. The only reason to oppose renewable energy technology is to cozy up to the oil and gas lobby, and they know they're wasting their time with me.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\Particularly given the threat posed to abortion access by the current composition of the Supreme Court, Maine should codify the right to access an abortion and ensure that access to legal health care procedures is available to all, regardless of economic status. Also, advanced practice nurses and certified nurse midwives should be allowed to practice to the fullest extent of their license, including care for women who desire a first-trimester medically induced abortion.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I know that seniors want to age at home whenever possible and assisting them with home care is both economically prudent for the state and greatly improves one's quality of life. I also believe that it is the legislature's job to develop a system where all are cared for responsibly. Ultimately, I fear that the legislature lacks the political will to develop, fund and implement such as system, and I was moved by the Maine Council of Churches supporting Question 1. I plan to vote in favor of it.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\On this issue, Mainers voted to approve such a system, and the legislature has a responsibility to legally and fully implement it. For all the logistical hurdles such a system might seem to pose to the legislature, ensuring that Mainers are able to cast their votes in a manner that represents their best intentions and desires at the ballot is a goal worth pursuing.\Senate District 31\Justin Chenette (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\The need for more workers is hindering economic growth. To attract young families and workers to our state, we must ensure folks can afford to buy and stay in their homes. We must make Maine a more affordable place to live. Property taxes and a lack of affordable housing options keep many families away. I led the effort to increase the homestead exemption & expand the property tax fairness credit. We must assist with start up small business costs. As President of Saco Main Street I see the need.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The only reason Medicaid expansion is not in place is because of Governor LePage. He has held this up every chance he gets. The legislature has outlined several funding sources to cover any costs above and beyond using money in the existing program. We also have a major budget surplus that can be used to expand healthcare to more people and drive down costs in the system. I have supported Medicaid expansion every step of the way and will push for it's full implementation.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\It means accountability in the system. The real money is in corporate welfare. Taxpayers have been picking up the tab for lining corporate shareholder and CEO pockets. As a Taxation Committee member, I've seen this. Hundreds of millions of dollars each year automatically doled out without any oversight in how the money is spent or if it's yielding benefits for Mainers. We must protect taxpayers by putting in claw back provisions if no jobs are created, taxpayers get their money back.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\The more and more electric vehicles on the road, the less and less the gas tax is a relevant source of revenue for much-needed infrastructure needs like road and bridge repair. As someone who drives a hybrid, charging us a special fee doesn't make sense as electric vehicles become mainstream. The Transportation Department along with the legislature will have to start researching and analyzing the best way to move to entirely new system. The elimination of the gas tax is inevitable.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Yes. Maine should be on the forefront of the energy future for this country. I've previously introduced measures to replenish the solar energy program. This offered small businesses and individual homeowners an incentive to convert their places from oil to solar. Whether a tax credit or a rebate, assisting the transition to solar can be a deciding factor in making the switch. Lowering energy costs should be a top priority.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support a women's right to make her own healthcare decisions. Interesting that the same politicians that are for 'smaller government' are the same ones that want government to come into a women's life and dictate the terms of what she can and cannot do. I believe current law is adequate by offering protections and access. If proposals to change this would be introduced, I would oppose them.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I will be voting for the ballot question. It's proven that home-based care reduces costs in providing care to vulnerable populations. People want to age in place and ability to pay shouldn't be a barrier. This helps address the need for care. The funding mechanism will need to reviewed if passed. We already had a referendum targeting the cost of education by requiring the wealthiest among us to pay their fair share that hasn't been implemented yet. I don't want to pit students against seniors.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Respecting the will of the voters shouldn't be an option. When a small group of politicians can cherry-pick which election results to abide by, it's a a slippery slope for our democratic intuitions. Politicians can disagree about a referendum, but they shouldn't disagree about the outcome of the election. Proposing a constitutional amendment only sends it back out to the people to vote. The public has a right to weigh in on whether they would like to make Ranked Choice Voting constitutional.\Stavros Mendros (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Regulations, red tape and taxes. Love him or hate him, anyone who does not recognize Governor LePage's amazing success at increasing the standard of living is lying to themselves.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\If we are even going to seriously tackle the Opioid crisis we need to provide services to addicts and the mentally ill. Those services will not be given until those people have coverage. They won't get jobs until they get the help they need. If we don't give them the care they need, we will be spending a LOT more when they wind up in jail or the hospital.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\There are too many mid level managers in state government. They justify their existence by making front line workers do more reports thus giving them less time to provide services and costing taxpayers far too much money. And ultimately, less actual help is given to the people the services are there to help. Social Services need to be help for the needy not a jobs program for bureaucrats.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Construction rates increase annually at a greater rate than the interest on our bonds. So putting off projects until we have money will actually cost more to do and because of the damage not being repaired in time the improvements will be greater. This is truly an example of being penny-wise and pound-foolish.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\This always turns out to be a way to funnel money into the hands of politically connected groups and hasn't had anything to do with conserving resources in many years.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I oppose government sanctioned killing in any form. Be it a death penalty for murderers or babies. Federal law really ties the state's hands on this.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I was the lead House sponsor of a similar bill while serving in the 119th. The parts of the bill that provide funding and take away privacy rights need to be amended but I like the concept and am leaning in favor of this.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\The people have voted for this twice. As an elected official how can I not respect the will of the voters who put me into office?\Senate District 32\Susan Deschambault (D) - Incumbent\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\We need to give young people a reason to stay in Maine as well as move here--and demonstrate that you can find a high wage job or successfully grow a business here. There are a couple of low hanging fruit: expand broadband, create career pathways and expand retraining efforts for our returning military veterans, expand mentor/internship programs between secondary and post-secondary students with local businesses, and, finally, expand the Opportunity Maine program.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\The Legislature has offered numerous ways to fund Medicaid expansion. At this point, it's become a political football for a small group of expansion opponents. We could use Tobacco Settlement funds or use funds from the revenue surplus. Meanwhile, for every day that we don't expand Medicaid, tens of thousands of people are going without health insurance and we're losing money matched by the feds.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\It's as simple as preserving assistance when our neighbors or our families fall on hard times and ensuring that the safety net is transparent and accountable. . A recipient shouldn't abruptly lose assistance because they've received a bump in income. Next, is ensuring that people aren't gaming the system. Doing so takes money away from those who genuinely need it. Welfare is one way to lift people out of poverty - we have to ensure that the system can work.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Borrowing every year to pay for regular maintenance isn't sustainable. Recent projections show shortfalls in the coming years. Increased fuel efficiency and a stagnant state gas tax since 2011, Maine's gas tax no longer sufficiently covers the needs of our highways. Look at other options such as direct the sales tax from transportation related purchases and devote it to the highway maintenance fund. Make sure we're spreading the cost among the users of the state's highways.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\Climate change is a major threat to our natural resources and to our economy. We need to move away from energy sources that increase carbon emissions; instead move toward increasing our use of clean, renewable energy. Incenting renewable energy technologies, we can aggressively move toward clean energy policies like those of our other N.E. neighbors. Wind and solar development can expand our workforce, provide more business for other Maine companies, and make Maine an energy leader.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I support the current laws that support a woman's right to control their health and fertility--and ultimately their bodies. I would not support any bills that would seek to limit or restrict that.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Q1 offers a solution that would not be good for Maine. My primary objection is that there's no means or residency test. If passed, it would take Maine taxpayer money and give it to those who don't need it. Next, if passed, Maine would have the highest income tax rate in the country-taxing families making more than $128,400/year. Lastly, it sets up a board that's not accountable to taxpayers or elected representatives. We need to solve for this problem creatively, fairly, and sustainably.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\It makes sense at this point, after the voters have had an opportunity to test it out during the primary and now the general election, that we put the issue of amending the constitution for state races out to referendum and let the people decide. I've heard strong opinions on both sides of the issue--including voters who initially supported RCV and have since changed their minds.\Scott Normandeau (R)\Did not respond.\Senate District 33\David Woodsome (R) - Incumbent\Did not respond.\John Tuttle (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\We need to become more innovative with economic development in Maine. I believe that we can go to every town in Senate District 33 and find something that is unique to that community for the purpose of economic development and job growth for that town. We need to increase our efforts to assist the family farm so that young people can come back and continue farming as their families have done for generations. Maine was the bread basket of the country, I feel that we can become that again.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Without the Medicaid expansion Maine hospitals will suffer greatly especially in rural areas. The expansion will also help keep stability for workers in the Health Care industry. Maine is facing a shortage now of nurses and we need to fill those jobs. Federal dollars will cover the vast majority of funding for the expansion. We have seen the economic growth from other states where the program was expanded which will cover the difference. I believe the same growth can happen in Maine.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\We are all not descended from kings. Coming from a working-class family, I believe that anyone capable of work should work. There are some programs that I think are working well, but there are others that will need to be evaluated in the upcoming years such as the how state funds are used for payment of items other than essentials (food). Contrary to what some might believe, people do not like to be poor. We should help those who cannot help themselves such as the elderly and disabled.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\I believe that we should still fund transportation with state and federal gas taxes. However, if a funding gap does exist we should look to other areas of state government for funding. Whether it should be dedicating a certain percent of general fund revenues or dedicating new revenues from internet sales which have not been available to Maine in the past.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I do believe that renewable energy provides great opportunity for Maine. I believe we need to invest in renewable energy such as the solar power project at the Sanford Seacoast Regional Airport expected to create 200 new jobs and millions in tax revenue.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I am pro-life and a life-long Catholic so I find this difficult to address. The laws as they stand should stay in place as I do not feel that we can take away a woman's right on their decision making. I do feel that we have opportunities to provide better access to alternatives to abortion including job protections as a means to support them in pro life decisions.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\I do support Question 1. I feel that providing home based care for the elderly will save the state money in the long run. It has been proven that home based care costs are far less than putting the elderly in long term care facilities.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\Initially I was undecided as prior Chair of Veterans Affairs, but I do feel that we must accept the will of the people and allow for ranked-choice voting to be used in all Maine elections.\Senate District 34\Robert A. Foley (R)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\Finding and maintaining a well trained workforce has made it difficult for existing businesses to grow and expand. The legislature needs to partner with our education system, both local and higher education, to prepare students for the jobs that are here now and into the future. Technical training centers in association with business entities and educational institutions needs to be encouraged.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\We need to place guardrails on the eligibility in order to prevent unanticipated cost overruns and incentivize more recipients in the 100% to 138% of poverty to seek coverage in the Exchange. The Exchange provides better coverage and is portable for those recipients. I would use the current hospital tax already in place to pay for the cost of expansion.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\We need to constantly evaluate each program and whether they are meeting and servicing the needs of those intended. As the economy continues to grow we need to insure that those who can work are and those needing job training in order to work receive those needed skills.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maintaining our roads and bridges needs to be a priority. Annual borrowing through bonding isn't the best way to accomplish this goal. I would support looking into using the automobile sales tax revenue as a source along with the gas tax.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\I support the net metering program for solar as it provides electricity back into the grid at a competitive rate. I do not support wind energy as I believe the costs to produce and the damage to the environmental makes it too costly.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\I would prefer to see fewer abortions and more adoptions being offered.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\No, I believe that the proposal is unconstitutional providing a tax and spending plan outside of the statutory budgetary process with no oversight by the legislature. I believe the proposal violates the federal HIPPA laws, There is no means testing or residency requirement to receive these services. It will take away needed resources and services from those who truly need those services while providing resources to those who do not.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\No, I believe there is a simpler, less expensive way that insures a true majority winner and that is the instant runoff system where the top two candidates, if neither gets a majority, run against each other in a separate election.\Thomas J. Wright (D)\1. What is the biggest barrier to economic development in Maine and what can the Legislature do to address it?\To point to any one issue and say it is the biggest impediment to economic development would be difficult. During my 2 terms in the State House, I served on the Business and Economic Development Committee where we heard many great ideas. What Maine needs to focus on are the resources we have. Research and development of new wood products, creating jobs with off shore wind and solar and re-energizing our agricultural base are all things we can do now.\2. Maine voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017, but it is still not in place amid a lack of dedicated funding from the Legislature. How should funding concerns be addressed?\Medicaid expansion is a good bargain and will save Maine money. Having more people with healthcare being able to get regular checkups reduces the cost of emergency care. Doctors, hospitals, and people with healthcare cover the cost of people that don't have it. Bringing in millions of dollars of federal money will help stabilize the small hospitals serving rural areas. A healthy population is more productive and healthy children learn more.\3. Republicans and Democrats have used the term ""welfare reform"" to describe many changes to social services programs. What does the term mean to you?\There will always be a part of society that will need assistance at some point in their lives. The loss of a job, an injury, illness or other unforeseen circumstance will cause someone to need assistance. Unfortunately, many people asking for help are working poor. Many have part-time jobs, sometimes two or three, with no benefits. Paying living wages is one way to help these people, reducing the need for state benefits. Any part of benefit reform needs to include job training to help people.\4. Maine relies on annual borrowing as part of its plan to maintain roads and bridges as state and federal gas taxes become an increasingly outdated way of funding transportation. Should the state revisit the way it funds infrastructure? If so, how?\Maine's economy depends on a robust, modern infrastructure. Roads, bridges, rail, and ports need to be upgraded to be able to quickly move goods and services in and out of the state. Gas taxes alone are not enough to pay for infrastructure and we need to broaden our tax base. Borrowing can be costly, but necessary. Just fixing the worst bridges and roads would create jobs, and would put that money back into the local economy.\5. Should the state expand incentives to encourage renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power? Why or why not?\The potential available in off shore wind and solar to change Maine's energy future is enormous. There are proven technologies that the state could use to free us from the importation of fossil fuels. Every dollar spent on expanding our renewable resources keeps more money in Maine and our people working. The new technologies required create good paying jobs keeping our young people in state.\6. Do you think laws around abortion access should be loosened or restricted? If so, how?\A woman's healthcare decisions and reproductive rights should be respected and the law of the land. To reduce the number of abortions, women and men should have full access to reproductive education so there are no unplanned pregnancies. Teaching people about their reproductive rights and responsibilities will help them make better choices in their lives and eliminate the need for hard decisions later.\7. Will you be voting for or against Question 1, the home-care citizen initiative on this year's ballot? Why or why not?\Maine's aging population is putting a strain on our existing safety net for seniors and those with disabilities. At the same time, there are facilities closing all over the state. The bankruptcy rate for those over 65 is soaring, often driven by medical needs. Most people want to stay in their homes to be near their family and friends and could do so with a little help. We need to find a safe, equitable way to help them while respecting their privacy.\8. Do you support a constitutional amendment that would allow ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial and legislative general elections? Why or why not?\The voters of Maine have spoken and ranked choice voting is the law. The first round during the June primary showed it is feasible and it worked well. I would like to see it implemented for all elections and adopted nationally. With ranked choice, we get a winner that is truly the choice of the majority.\Senate District 35\Mark Lawrence (D)\Did not respond.\Michael Estes (R)\Did not respond.\Credit: Michael Shepherd BDN Staff"

AUGUSTA -- Friends of Maine's Mountains, a group that opposes the proliferation of grid-scale wind power, announced Thursday that it's supporting Gov. Paul LePage's push against a citizen initiative that would expand the state's renewable energy portfolio.
\
Maine currently mandates that utility companies derive a certain percentage of electricity from renewable sources. However, a coalition called Maine Citizens for Clean Energy has launched a citizen referendum to increase the requirements in the state's so-called Renewable Portable Standard.
\
The initiative runs sharply against the governor's energy policy. Last year, LePage tried to freeze the current RPS mandate but met stiff opposition from the state's wind-power lobby and environmental groups.
\
On Wednesday, the governor told the Capitol News Service that the citizen effort to expand the Renewable Portfolio Standard was ""nothing more than a scam to make a few people wealthy.""
\
On Thursday, the Friends of Maine's Mountains group backed the governor.
\
""This would be an environmental and economic disaster for Maine,"" said Chris O'Neil in a prepared statement, adding that passage of the citizen initiative was a ""de facto mandate for an unsustainable buildup of wind turbines and costly transmission systems on Maine's mountains.""
\
He added, ""Markets would not support any wind power at all if not for a complicated brew of incentives, grants, mandates, tax breaks, surcharges and other government-created gimmicks.""
\
Maine's RPS is set to reach 40 percent by 2017. The referendum would increase that mandate to 50 percent by 2020, while also requiring providers to invest in energy efficiency. Maine's current RPS is 34 percent.
\
Proponents of the RPS say it encourages the development of renewable resources, which in turn, leads to job creation. Opponents say the mandate is costly, drives up rates and favors the development of wind power while excluding Canadian hydropower from counting toward the RPS total.
\
States including Vermont have changed their RPS mandate to allow Canadian hydropower to count toward RPS.
\
LePage has been pursuing a new energy policy that might include importing Canadian hydropower. Ken Fletcher, the governor's energy czar, told the Sun Journal last month that Hydro-Quebec had also inquired about being allowed to count toward RPS.
\
Maine Citizens for Clean Energy held a news conference in Augusta this week to support the referendum. The group said it's confident it will collect more than 57,000 valid signatures needed by the end of January to get the question on the ballot later this year.
\
Environment Northeast's Maine director, Beth Nagusky, acknowledged that residential electric bills would rise initially, but then decrease if the measure passes.
\
The governor has cited an analysis by the Maine Public Utilities Commission that estimated the citizen initiative would cost between $40 million and $80 million a year.

"
404,"ELLSWORTH, Maine -- Recent statements from Gov. Paul LePage regarding wind energy are causing some angst in Maine's wind power industry at a time changes in Augusta and Washington, D.C., are creating uncertainty over political support for renewable energy.\Since his election in 2010, LePage has questioned the economics behind wind power as part of his administration's focus on lowering energy costs for Maine ratepayers. But the Republican governor's rhetoric has intensified in recent months, suggesting that the technology is increasing energy costs and padding the pockets of ""special interests.""\""We have people in Maine who say that wind is the answer. And it is the answer for people who lobby for wind,"" LePage told a crowd in April. ""Wind is costing us dearly. It's costing us jobs, it's costing us investment and it's costing us big.""\Those comments came months after LePage repeatedly suggested that state policies designed to encourage development of wind power were partly responsible for Maine's higher electric rates -- a claim sharply disputed by renewable energy proponents.\More recently, LePage has used the debate over wind power to attack independent U.S. Senate candidate and former governor Angus King, repeatedly calling him ""the king of the wind cartel"" and suggesting he made ""a fortune"" on ratepayers backs. King was until recently a large stakeholder in Independence Wind that built the 22-turbine Record Hill wind farm.\While LePage's statements have been welcomed by wind power critics in Maine, they've caused some discomfort in an industry that supporters point out has invested more than $1 billion in Maine -- and much of that during a recession. They also suggest the comments stand in stark contrast to LePage's mantra of being a pro-jobs and pro-business governor.\""The current administration has made some negative public comments which are not conducive to attracting investment and to the growth of the industry in the state of Maine,"" said Paul Williamson, director and principal coordinator for the Maine Wind Industry Initiative.\Williamson, whose organization is a coalition of companies, researchers and port authority officials, said LePage's comments are not factually based.\""Any time you have the top elected official in the state questioning whether wind energy is a good thing in Maine, that creates concern,"" added Jeremy Payne, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association, an industry trade group. ""However, legislators have been very clear about their support for the industry over the years.""\Maine is New England's largest producer of wind energy, with 205 commercial wind turbines spinning at seven wind farms built since 2006. Construction of those projects involved hundreds of workers at a time with contributions from more than 300 Maine companies, according to a February 2011 study by Charles Colgan at the University of Southern Maine.\But despite the rapid growth of the industry, wind energy represented just 6.6 percent of the total electricity generated in Maine in January 2012, compared with 25 percent generated by hydropower. And there remains significant debate over whether wind power would be cost-competitive without subsidies, federal tax credits and state policies meant to encourage the development of renewable energy sources.\Kenneth Fletcher, director of the Governor's Office of Energy Independence and Security, is less brash than his boss in talking about wind energy. But he insisted the administration's policy has been consistent.\""I think what the governor is saying is if wind power is a source of energy that will lower the price of electricity, then he is in favor of it,"" Fletcher said. ""Our concern is: is this going to be sustainable over time?""\A big part of that equation depends on what happens in Washington, D.C., over the coming months. Action in Congress has been stalled on whether to renew so-called ""production tax credits"" that help wind power compete with cheaper fossil fuel-derived electricity generation.\On the state front, the LePage administration has also sought -- without success -- to rewrite Maine policies known as the ""renewable portfolio standard,"" or RPS, that require utilities to increase the amount of electricity they receive from renewable sources, such as wind.\Fletcher said the governor argues that both of those policies mean taxpayers and ratepayers are supporting the wind industry's investment in Maine.\""If the federal tax credit wasn't there and the RPS wasn't there, you would not see the investment,"" Fletcher said.\Regardless of the political debate over subsidies for wind energy, it is clear that the wind power industry was one of the few bright spots in the Maine economy during the recession.\The nine wind farms built in Maine since 2008 or currently under construction cost $974 million to build, according to industry data.\An independent January 2012 study commissioned by the Maine Public Utilities Commission estimated that construction of half of the wind energy proposals in Maine -- or 625 megawatts of wind power capacity -- could create 12,000 direct and indirect jobs and add $1.1 billion to Maine's economy.\""The governor has been very clear about his support for jobs and we hope he will come around to embrace the industry,"" Payne said.\One of the companies that benefited the most from Maine's entrance into the wind energy industry is Reed & Reed, a Woolwich-based firm that has helped build many of the facilities.\""For the past 5 years, [wind power] has been about one-half of our business and that is a sector that did not exist 7 or 8 years ago,"" said Jack Parker, president and CEO of Reed & Reed.\The company currently has about 200 employees working on a First Wind project in Hancock County as well as at a wind farm in Vermont. Those jobs range from carpenters and engineers to the skilled operators needed to run cranes with a 300-foot boom.\Asked whether his company could have provided jobs to employees during the recession without the wind power contracts, Parker said simply ""not even close.""\Parker steered clear of critiquing LePage's comments on the wind energy industry. But he said his company as well as others have had conversations with the governor and his advisors about wind power and lowering electricity rates, saying the two are aligned.\""I hope the Maine regulatory environment will remain stable,"" he said. ""That is certainly critical to the success of the industry.""\Fletcher speculated that some of the angst in the industry has to do with the fact that Maine shifted from a pro-wind governor in Baldacci to one who is more neutral.\""We aren't against wind,"" Fletcher said. ""But we are saying let's be more objective and make sure we understand the economics.""\But some industry representatives question whether the governor and his advisors truly do understand.\Williamson with the Maine Wind Industry Initiative -- a coalition of companies, researchers and port authorities working to grow Maine's wind power industry -- said he believes LePage's comments are based in ideology, not facts.\""It is incumbent on all of us within the industry to educate the governor and the public,"" Williamson said.\Credit: Kevin Miller BDN Staff"
405,"A LePage administration report found only a small amount of untapped hydropower potential at existing dams but is recommending regulatory and policy changes to grow the energy sector.\A new report on Maine's hydropower potential found limited opportunities to expand power generation at existing dams, but suggests the state could encourage hydropower development by tweaking state policies. \The report released Thursday by Gov. Paul LePage's Energy Office identified 56 megawatts of additional power - beyond the more than 750 megawatts of installed capacity - that might be available by expanding or upgrading facilities that produce power now or by restarting dormant facilities with new technology. But the consultants authoring the report said such expansions are unlikely because of economics and a challenging regulatory environment at the federal and state levels. \Other recommendations include allowing long-term pricing contracts, as well as the re-creation of a ""state hydropower coordinator"" to boost further development of Maine's largest renewable energy source. Hydropower generates 26 percent of the state's electricity. \Last year, the LePage administration hired a group of consultants to inventory the state's hydroelectric facilities and identify those that can be upgraded or restarted with new technology. LePage has repeatedly called for exploring ways to tap into more hydropower generation sources - whether in Maine or neighboring Canada - as well as expanding natural gas pipelines into Maine. \After surveying 891 dams, however, the consultants found just 47 sites with the potential to generate additional electricity - a total of 56 megawatts. That is the equivalent of a large wind power facility in Maine and is just one-tenth of the full operating capacity of the gas-fired Calpine power plant in Westbrook. \The study did not evaluate sites of potential new dams, but did say Maine has significant opportunities for ""hydrokinetic"" power facilities that generate electricity from the tides, waves or rivers. \SURPRISING LACK OF HYDR0 POTENTIAL \Randall Dorman, senior regulatory coordinator with the Pittsfield-based consultant firm Kleinschmidt, described the hydropower results as surprising in that all of the sites were ""uneconomic"" under a ""generous"" pricing scheme. That pricing model factored in engineering, regulatory and other costs, but did not include potential transmission costs, which could be substantial for some projects. Other sites were eliminated after being deemed unfeasible because of environmental concerns. \""Even using these very generous parameters, all of the hydro sites we identified had simple paybacks of longer than 20 years, which would indicate they would be extremely expensive to develop and would not be very attractive to lenders or developers to approach,"" Dorman said. ""So that was somewhat of a surprising finding."" \Dorman and the other consultants said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission presents the largest hurdle for any dam project and often discourages attempts by dam owners to restart old dams. However, the consultants suggested potential state-level policy or regulatory changes to encourage more investment by the industry, based on their surveys of hydropower companies and other states. Those included: \n Establishing a state hydropower office or coordinator responsible for coordinating all of the state agencies involved in reviewing hydropower applications. The Maine State Planning Office - which LePage disbanded - at one time had a hydropower coordinator, but the position essentially dissolved in the 1990s as the person was assigned other responsibilities. \n Opening up Maine's ""renewable energy portfolio standard"" - which are credits paid to renewable energy producers - to capture more hydropower facilities. \n Introducing legislation to allow the Public Utilities Commission ""to solicit pricing for long-term contracts for existing and new hydro facilities, and if the price is deemed prudent, to direct the utilities to enter into agreements for this power."" \n Promoting hydropower to improve public perception of the renewable energy source. \WILLING TO ADJUST STATE POLICIES \Patrick Woodcock, director of the Governor's Energy Office, said long-term pricing would provide the same level of predictability that has encouraged investments in wind power and other types of renewable energy in Maine. And while 56 megawatts is not a large part of Maine's electricity consumption, it is also not an insignificant amount, Woodcock said. \""I think we need to look at whether our regulations and public policies are supporting (hydropower),"" Woodcock said. ""I hope this will help start a conversation."" \Maine generates more hydropower per capita than any state east of the Mississippi River. Natural gas is responsible for generating 42 percent of the state's electricity, followed by hydropower at 26 percent, biomass facilities burning wood products at 20 percent and wind power at 6 percent. Coal, oil, other biomass products and other fuels make up the rest of the mix. \SOME HYDRO ISSUES CONTROVERSIAL \LePage is expected to once again push to eliminate the 100-megawatt cap on Maine's renewable energy portfolio standard, or RPS, as he has every year of his administration. Lifting the cap could help the state negotiate power purchasing agreements with Hydro Quebec and other Canadian hydropower companies. \Environmental and wind power organizations have resisted those attempts. \Under the LePage administration, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and its commissioner, Patricia Aho, an attorney who once represented dam owners, have been criticized for losing the ability to dictate terms on water-quality issues, including lake levels during dam relicensing, by missing filing deadlines with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \Jeremy Payne, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association, wasn't surprised that the consultants did not identify more potential ""low-hanging fruit"" in Maine's existing hydropower facilities. \""If there were hundreds of megawatts (available), they probably would have been picked before this study ever began,"" Payne said.

406,"Can state cut energy costs? The heat is on\The governor and Legislature will need to compromise to come up with sorely needed efficiencies.\By Tux Turkel tturkel@mainetoday.com\Staff Writer\Mainers are burdened by some of the highest energy bills in the country. Paying $3,000 to $4,000 a year to heat a home is not uncommon. Over the next month, state lawmakers will try to agree on specific steps to lower those costs.\[image removed] Caption:\In this October 2012 file photo, The Revs. Alice and David Anderman show off a new energy-efficient furnace, hot water tank and foam insulation-covered walls in the basement of their home in Waterville.\Staff photo by David Leaming\A handful of proposed laws aim to increase access to natural gas, help homeowners switch heating systems, and make homes and businesses more efficient, so they use less fuel or electricity. In some cases, taxpayers, oil heat customers or utility ratepayers would help pay for the measures.\But with a Democratic majority in the Legislature and a Republican governor who is averse to spending hikes and rate subsidies, meaningful accomplishments will demand compromise.\""We have the potential for a stalemate if we go along partisan lines,"" said Sen. John Cleveland, an Auburn Democrat who is co-chairman of the committee that handles energy legislation. ""And that would not be a good outcome for Maine.""\Some of the key bills would:\- Redirect money now spent on cutting electricity consumption and use a portion of it to subsidize the purchase of more efficient home heating equipment or home weatherization.\- Authorize a $55 million bond issue to weatherize and upgrade efficiency in homes.\- Add resources to Efficiency Maine Trust, a fund supported by the auction of greenhouse gas emission limits that supports energy efficiency programs.\- Create a state authority to issue bonds that would pay for expanding natural gas pipelines, giving more residents access to a less expensive fuel for heating.\Cleveland's committee has held public hearings on a few of these proposals, but most are expected to be presented over the next three weeks. The Legislature has set a May 17 deadline for committees to finish their work on bills, so there's not much time.\Cleveland said his goal is to craft elements of the leading bills into a comprehensive package that can gain political traction but also have real benefits for Mainers.\""If we can't find common ground, it's likely that most of these bills won't survive,"" Cleveland said. ""We can't all be purists on this issue, or we'll get nothing done.""\Cutting heating costs is the focus of a proposal from Gov. Paul LePage. It would shift millions of dollars from programs that lower home and business electricity usage to efforts that can cut home heating bills.\The plan would essentially change the mission of Efficiency Maine Trust, the quasi-public agency set up in 2009 to administer energy efficiency programs. Most of the trust's funding comes from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, a program in which air-emission limits are sold at auction, and through a small tax on electric bills, called a system benefit charge. Because the funding is linked to electric rates, most of the trust's programs are aimed at cost-effective measures to cut electricity costs, such as upgrading motors in factories or subsidizing compact-fluorescent light bulbs.\""I think there's a genuine interest in refocusing on heating costs,"" said Patrick Woodcock, the governor's energy director.\Changes in the RGGI program mean Maine stands to take in up to $9 million this year. Forty percent of that -- roughly $3.6 million -- would be earmarked for homeowners to cut heating costs, through measures that could include buying more-efficient heating systems, switching from oil to natural gas, or weatherizing their homes.\Cleveland has agreed to co-sponsor the bill, which could give it added weight. Despite that, the bill contains elements that Cleveland acknowledges he and other Democrats will find hard to support.\(Continued on page 2)\1 | 2 | NEXT >>\Single Page\Credit: By Tux Turkel tturkel@mainetoday.com Staff Writer"
407,"AUGUSTA, Maine -- Heating efficiency and weatherization programs could be reduced in favor of cutting electricity rates for select industries if an energy bill filed by the LePage administration this week becomes law.\Democrats said that while they don't view solving Maine's energy problem as a partisan issue and see ample ground for compromise, cutting back on weatherization efforts undermines the best long-term solution to a longer-term problem.\LD 1425, An Act to Create Affordable Heating Options for Maine Residents and Reduce Business Energy Costs, which was printed Tuesday by the Legislature's Revisor of Statutes, is sponsored by Rep. Larry Dunphy, R-Embden, but originated with the LePage administration. It would divert some revenue to the Efficiency Maine Trust, which is dedicated to helping Mainers' weatherization and energy-efficiency projects in their homes and businesses, to fund conversions from oil to cheaper forms of heating fuels such as wood pellets, natural gas and propane. It also would authorize the Public Utilities Commission to use some of the trust's revenue to provide rebates of electricity expenses for targeted businesses and industries. The bill does not specify how much revenue would be diverted nor which businesses or industries it would benefit.\Patrick Woodcock, director of LePage's energy office, said the bill would provide immediate relief for low-income Mainers who otherwise couldn't afford a heating system conversion. It also would provide incentives to businesses that will help Maine's economy, he said.\""Right now most Mainers spend well over $250 a month on heating. Annually that equates to well over $3,000 and we are an absolute outlier with our heating costs,"" said Woodcock. ""There are options for Mainers to dramatically reduce their heating costs, such as an efficient propane system. Right now there is nothing that provides resources for people to make that conversion and this bill changes that.""\The Efficiency Maine Trust, established in 2009, is funded primarily through a ""system benefit charge"" assessed on all Maine electricity ratepayers and proceeds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, which is a system among several states of auctioning carbon dioxide emissions allowances and investing the proceeds to benefit energy consumers.\In 2012, Efficiency Maine spent nearly $24 million on its programs, which was matched by about $36 million in participant contributions. The organization estimated those expenditures created a ""lifetime energy benefit"" of more than $128 million, according to its annual report.\Democrats have their own bill to alter the Efficiency Maine Trust. Sen. James Boyle, D-Gorham, is preparing a bill that has not yet been printed. It would call on heating fuels wholesalers to voluntarily contribute to Efficiency Maine's Heating Fuels Efficiency and Weatherization Fund, which would then be matched with RGGI revenues. The fund was previously supported partially by funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, but that money dried up last year.\Boyle said he was working on his bill long before he saw LePage's.\""The governor's bill would allow people to take money from the Efficiency Maine Trust program and change their heating system,"" said Boyle. ""They could still have a home leaking like a sieve but now you're putting a different heating system in it. That just seems to fly in the face of logic. I really think my bill takes a holistic look at helping homeowners be more efficient.""\Boyle said his initial discussions about the concept have indicated that some oil dealers would be interested in contributing to the fund, even though it's voluntary.\""We want to make it so that they can be part of the solution,"" said Boyle. ""It will be a missed opportunity if we end up spending less on energy efficiency than we are now.""\Michael Stoddard, executive director of Efficiency Maine, agreed. He said he opposes reducing his organization's activities when it comes to energy efficiency, but even if that happens he said he's grateful that LePage's bill would continue to provide some level of funding.\""This bill is recognizing that those programs are important and that they need to continue to be funded,"" said Stoddard. ""I think that's a positive step. The obvious question is, 'Is there a fixed or shrinking pie or is there an expanding pie so that we can do both electricity programs and heating programs?'""\Sen. John Cleveland, D-Auburn, is co-chairman of the Legislature's Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee. He said he expects his committee to work LePage's and Boyle's bills, and perhaps elements from others, into a combined committee bill that he hopes will have widespread support among both Democrats and Republicans.\""It's not likely that anything will get done if it comes out of the committee as a partisan approval,"" said Cleveland. ""Looking for common ground is our best solution to enact bills that benefit the people and businesses of Maine.""\Dylan Voorhees, clean energy project director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said these two bills, along with another involving natural gas, which was presented last week by House Minority Leader Kenneth Fredette, R-Newport, could likely end up being the major energy initiatives of the legislative session. He said he saw kernels of merit in LePage's bill but that energy efficiency will reap more long-term benefits than switching the population to another fuel source.\""Whether it's oil or natural gas or wood pellets, shouldn't we want to use less of it?"" he asked.\Credit: Christopher Cousins BDN Staff"
408,"
AUGUSTA -- The Legislature's Energy Committee unveiled a multipronged bill Tuesday that incorporates elements from nine different measures aimed at expanding Maine's natural gas infrastructure, boosting funding for energy efficiency, directly lowering businesses' electricity costs and making it more affordable for residents to abandon oil heat.
\
The combined bill includes provisions from legislation proposed by Gov. Paul LePage and Democratic and Republican members of the Legislature. It has elements designed to appeal to LePage, who has emphasized policies that directly reduce energy costs, and Democrats and environmental groups, who have advocated for investments in energy efficiency.
\
""It's a fairly significant piece of work,"" said Sen. John Cleveland, D-Auburn, the committee's Senate chairman.
\
The bill includes an overarching focus on reducing energy costs while directing more funding to the Efficiency Maine Trust over the next two years for programs that would help industrial facilities cut back on greenhouse gas emissions. Efficiency Maine, under the newly crafted bill, would also be charged with administering a program suggested in legislation from LePage that offers homeowners rebates to help them convert to more efficient home heating systems.
\
""We know many people are paying heating costs that are high and that, for many people, it's not affordable,"" Cleveland said. ""We recognize that efficiency is important to do.""
\
With natural gas, the committee's legislation incorporates pieces from two bills sponsored by House Republican Leader Rep. Kenneth Fredette of Newport that could lead to the state partially financing a buildout of pipeline infrastructure in southern New England so more natural gas can make its way into the regional electric grid and reduce electricity costs in Maine.
\
The Energy Committee bill would allow the state to issue bonds -- through the Finance Authority of Maine -- to buy natural gas pipeline capacity for the state and assist other states in pipeline projects that could benefit Maine. The bill would also let the state enter into energy cost-reduction contracts with natural gas generators by selling state-owned pipeline capacity in exchange for rates that reduce electricity costs.
\
In addition, the bill would let the Maine Public Utilities Commission order natural gas utilities to connect their pipelines -- and pay them to do it -- when those additional connections could expand the availability of natural gas in the state.
\
Cleveland said those measures are designed to compensate for a marketplace that has been slow to make infrastructure investments that allow more natural gas to flow Maine's way.
\
""We believe there's a market failure,"" he said. ""Our preference is that the marketplace will come forward to address this need and the failure in the marketplace, but currently because of the nature of the market, that is not occurring.""
\
About a third of Maine's electricity today comes from natural gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. If additional pipeline capacity allows more natural gas to flow toward Maine and New England from the Marcellus Shale rock formation -- which covers much of New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia -- Maine could be better insulated from electricity price swings that occur when pipeline capacity is nearly maxed out, said Public Utilities Commission Chairman Thomas Welch.
\
Maine wouldn't be assuming full responsibility for building pipeline infrastructure, Welch said, but the state's participation would help spur pipeline construction.
\
""There are a lot of people looking at that gas, and we're putting ourselves at a competitive disadvantage if we don't get it,"" Welch told lawmakers.
\
The Energy Committee bill is the result of a collaboration that has involved Cleveland; Rep. Barry Hobbins, D-Saco, the Energy Committee's House chairman; Republican committee members Sen. Edward Youngblood of Brewer and Rep. Larry Dunphy of Embden; Welch; Patrick Woodcock, who directs LePage's energy office; and representatives from industry and environmental groups.
\
The bill addresses how the state divvies up two major energy-related revenue streams: funds Maine receives from carbon emission allowance auctions through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, and $82 million the federal government has paid Maine for failing to remove 550 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel that's been sitting at the defunct Maine Yankee nuclear plant since the Wiscasset facility closed in 1996.
\
LePage had proposed using RGGI auction revenues to directly reduce electricity rates for businesses and to lower residential heating costs by offering homeowners rebates to convert their oil heating systems to more efficient wood pellet, natural gas and propane systems. The funds have traditionally paid for energy efficiency programs run by the Efficiency Maine Trust.
\
The Energy Committee's bill instead uses half of the RGGI funds for LePage's priorities: 35 percent for the home heating rebate program and 15 percent for electricity rate reductions. The remaining half would be used for electricity efficiency projects at commercial and industrial facilities.
\
The bill sends 55 percent of Maine Yankee-related lawsuit funds to the Efficiency Maine Trust and uses 45 percent for direct electricity rate reductions. That funding would replace the money Efficiency Maine loses through the proposed elimination of the system benefit charge, which is assessed on businesses to fund conservation and efficiency programs. LePage had proposed eliminating the benefit charge from businesses' electric bill.
\
Woodcock, LePage's energy director, said the committee bill included ""significant improvements"" over current state energy policy. But he said the legislation needs to focus more on policies that make it easier for homeowners to switch to more affordable heating systems. In addition, LePage would prefer relying on the market rather than the state to expand natural gas pipeline infrastructure, Woodcock said.
\
Michael Stoddard, executive director of the Efficiency Maine Trust, said increased funding from the bill would free up Efficiency Maine to expand its focus beyond projects focused solely on electricity conservation.
\
The Energy Committee expects to make amendments to its bill and send it to the full Legislature in the coming days.

409,"AUGUSTA, Maine -- Gov. Paul LePage says Maine will sign on to a new regional plan to lower carbon emissions from power plants if lawmakers agree to a forthcoming proposal from his administration to use funding from carbon auctions to lower residential and business energy bills.\Maine and the eight other northeastern states that belong to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, this week agreed to reduce the cap on carbon emissions from power-generating facilities by 45 percent between 2014 and 2017. The states' plan lowers the cap to 91 million tons annually from the current 165 million-ton level. Maine's portion of the carbon emissions allowance is 3.6 percent of the total, said Patricia Aho, commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.\The reduction in the emissions cap is the result of a RGGI program review that found the region's actual emissions are far below the current cap.\The participating states -- which include all six New England states, New York, Delaware and Maryland -- are expected to use the cooperative's model rule as the basis for state-level policies.\RGGI started in 2005 with a goal of capping and reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 10 percent before 2018. The cooperative holds regular auctions that allow power generators to bid for carbon emission allowances. Participating states have generally invested their auction revenues in energy efficiency programs and renewable energy technologies.\LePage has never embraced RGGI, and the Republican-led 125th Legislature in 2011 passed a law that would withdraw the state from RGGI if a ""sufficient"" number of other participating states withdrew. Only New Jersey has withdrawn, and Maine has remained a participant.\The LePage administration now wants to use revenues from RGGI auctions to reduce electricity rates for businesses and lower residential heating costs. The administration plans to introduce legislation that would create a rebate program that helps low-income residents convert their oil heating systems to more efficient wood pellet, natural gas and propane systems, said Patrick Woodcock, director of the Governor's Energy Office.\The legislation would propose funneling the other portion of the state's RGGI revenues directly into electricity rate reductions for businesses, Woodcock said. The state's Public Utilities Commission would be charged with implementing the rate reduction, he said.\""When companies look at investing in the state of Maine, they look at labor costs and they look at energy costs,"" Woodcock said. ""We will never be able to have the least expensive electricity in the country, but the margins are important. We are trying to push Maine closer to the average.""\Maine has received about $4.5 million annually from RGGI auctions in recent years, according to Woodcock. With the lower emissions cap, that total would likely double, he said.\Another element in the legislation would eliminate the ""system benefit charge"" from all businesses' electricity bills, Woodcock said. That would save Maine businesses $5 million total, Woodcock said. But it would mean a $5 million loss for the Efficiency Maine Trust, which currently receives the revenue from the system benefit charge.\Environmental advocates praised the action by RGGI participants to lower the carbon emission cap, but voiced concerns about the LePage administration's plan for reinvesting auction revenues.\""Strengthening RGGI is one of the best ways we can reduce the pollution that causes global warming,"" Emily Figdor, director of Environment Maine, said in a statement.

Maine Gov. Paul LePage delivers his State of the State address Tuesday in Augusta.
\
Maine and the eight other northeastern states that belong to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, this week agreed to reduce the cap on carbon emissions from power-generating facilities by 45 percent between 2014 and 2017. The states' plan lowers the cap to 91 million tons annually from the current 165 million-ton level. Maine's portion of the carbon emissions allowance is 3.6 percent of the total, said Patricia Aho, commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
\
The reduction in the emissions cap is the result of a RGGI program review that found the region's actual emissions are far below the current cap.
\
The participating states -- which include all six New England states, New York, Delaware and Maryland -- are expected to use the cooperative's model rule as the basis for state-level policies.
\
RGGI started in 2005 with a goal of capping and reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 10 percent before 2018. The cooperative holds regular auctions that allow power generators to bid for carbon emission allowances. Participating states have generally invested their auction revenues in energy efficiency programs and renewable energy technologies.
\
LePage has never embraced RGGI, and the Republican-led 125th Legislature in 2011 passed a law that would withdraw the state from RGGI if a ""sufficient"" number of other participating states withdrew. Only New Jersey has withdrawn, and Maine has remained a participant.
\
The LePage administration now wants to use revenues from RGGI auctions to reduce electricity rates for businesses and lower residential heating costs. The administration plans to introduce legislation that would create a rebate program that helps low-income residents convert their oil heating systems to more efficient wood pellet, natural gas and propane systems, said Patrick Woodcock, director of the Governor's Energy Office.
\
The legislation would propose funneling the other portion of the state's RGGI revenues directly into electricity rate reductions for businesses, Woodcock said. The state's Public Utilities Commission would be charged with implementing the rate reduction, he said.
\
""When companies look at investing in the state of Maine, they look at labor costs and they look at energy costs,"" Woodcock said. ""We will never be able to have the least expensive electricity in the country, but the margins are important. We are trying to push Maine closer to the average.""
\
Maine has received about $4.5 million annually from RGGI auctions in recent years, according to Woodcock. With the lower emissions cap, that total would likely double, he said.
\
Another element in the legislation would eliminate the ""system benefit charge"" from all businesses' electricity bills, Woodcock said. That would save Maine businesses $5 million total, Woodcock said. But it would mean a $5 million loss for the Efficiency Maine Trust, which currently receives the revenue from the system benefit charge.
\
Environmental advocates praised the action by RGGI participants to lower the carbon emission cap, but voiced concerns about the LePage administration's plan for reinvesting auction revenues.
\
""Strengthening RGGI is one of the best ways we can reduce the pollution that causes global warming,"" Emily Figdor, director of Environment Maine, said in a statement. ""However, it's critical that the revenue from the program is invested in energy efficiency, and that's what Maine is doing right now. Energy efficiency locks in energy savings that lower bills not just today but year after year.""
\
LePage has consistently said he wants to lower the state's energy costs in an effort to attract more business to Maine. He devoted a portion of his State of the State address Tuesday night to discussing the state's energy costs. While Maine's average retail electricity price is the lowest in New England, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, it's 27 percent above the national average. In the industrial sector, Maine's average retail prices are 30 percent above the national average.
\
In his address, LePage said he plans to propose legislation to streamline the construction of natural gas delivery infrastructure in hopes of making the cheaper energy source more widely available in Maine.

""Maine's energy costs are too high, and it's killing economic opportunity,"" LePage said in the prepared version of his State of the State address.

411,"
AUGUSTA -- Gov. Paul LePage is withholding support for a compromise bill being worked out by the Legislature's Energy Committee that's aimed at expanding Maine's natural gas infrastructure, boosting funding for energy efficiency, directly lowering businesses' electricity costs and making it more affordable for residents to abandon oil heat.
\
LePage won't support the bill unless it also requires wind developers prove their projects will lower electricity costs in order to receive state approval and raises the 100-megawatt limit energy generation facilities must meet so they can count toward the state's renewable energy goals, according to Patrick Woodcock, who directs LePage's energy office.
\
The bill includes provisions from legislation proposed by LePage and Democratic and Republican legislators. It has elements designed to appeal to LePage, who has emphasized policies that directly reduce energy costs, and Democrats and environmental groups, who have advocated for investments in energy efficiency.
\
Woodcock said the legislation includes parts that LePage supports. ""There's a lot of consensus once and for all around developing a law that addresses heating costs,"" he said.
\
But the governor objects to other parts of the law, including a provision that would allow the Maine Public Utilities Commission rather than the Legislature to set the system benefit charge that's added to all electric bills to fund conservation and efficiency programs.
\
""That is not consistent with the governor's view of basic government,"" Woodcock said. ""He has very strong concerns about that provision.""
\
Republicans on the Energy Committee have suggested setting a cap on the system benefit charge the Public Utilities Commission can levy, but the committee hasn't reached an accord on that issue.
\
Woodcock has previously raised concerns about measures in the bill that would let the state purchase capacity in natural gas pipelines that would make it more economically feasible for developers to build pipelines that reach southern New England. If more natural gas can make its way into the regional electric grid, the bill's proponents say, Maine's electricity costs could fall.
\
Since the bill has a chance to attract support from members of both parties, a lack of support from LePage isn't necessarily an impediment to its passage.
\
""We will consider any item that the governor has proposed that improves the bill or benefits the people of Maine,"" said Sen. John Cleveland, D-Auburn, the Energy Committee's Senate chairman. ""We're going to produce the best bill we can produce.""
\
LePage has long advocated for changes to Maine's Wind Energy Act. Woodcock recently told Energy Committee members that the law should no longer set goals for increasing the state's wind energy capacity. Instead, he said, the law's goals should focus on lowering electricity costs.
\
LePage has also repeatedly called for raising the 100-megawatt limit renewable energy sources must meet in order to count toward the state's Renewable Portfolio Standard, which requires at least 40 percent of the state's energy come from renewable sources like solar and wind by 2017. The change would allow energy from large Canadian hydro projects to count toward the state's renewable energy requirements.
\
The Energy Committee bill is the product of work that has involved Cleveland; Rep. Barry Hobbins, D-Saco, the Energy Committee's House chairman; Republican committee members Sen. Edward Youngblood of Brewer and Rep. Larry Dunphy of Embden; Woodcock; Thomas Welch, the Public Utilities Commission chairman; the Industrial Energy Consumers' Group, which represents many of the state's paper mills; the Natural Resources Council of Maine; and others.
\
The bill incorporates pieces from two bills sponsored by House Republican Leader Rep. Kenneth Fredette of Newport that could lead to the state's ratepayers partially financing a buildout of pipeline infrastructure in southern New England so more natural gas can make its way from the Marcellus Shale rock formation -- which covers much of New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia -- to New England.
\
With more pipeline capacity flowing into New England, Maine could be better insulated from electricity price swings that occur when pipeline capacity is nearly maxed out, Welch, the Public Utilities Commission chairman, has told Energy Committee members.
\
If the state purchases capacity in a pipeline that's ultimately built, the Energy Committee bill would let the state enter into energy cost-reduction contracts with natural gas generators by selling capacity in exchange for rates that reduce electricity costs.
\
Committee members have recently amended the bill to limit the utilities commission's authority to craft those contracts by requiring the commission hire a consultant to negotiate the contract, working with the state's public advocate and the governor's energy office. The governor would have ultimate authority over whether Maine enters into such a contract.
\
The revised bill also installs a sunset provision that ends the state's authority to enter into a cost reduction contract in 2019, and it would require the Public Utilities Commission report back to the Legislature in two years on its progress negotiating cost reduction contracts.
\
""It's inappropriately putting the state of Maine in the position of investing speculatively in the gas markets,"" said Greg Cunningham, a senior attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation of Maine. ""It assumes that natural gas prices remain at low levels. It assumes that there are not other supplies of gas that become available. It assumes that there are not other demands for the gas, such as an international market that might drive the price of that investment up.""
\
Dylan Voorhees, clean energy project director with the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said his group has signed onto the Energy Committee bill because it proposes additional funding for energy efficiency and conservation projects and it allows Maine to sign onto a reduced cap on carbon emissions for power-generating facilities recently agreed to by the nine northeastern states that belong to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
\
Those benefits, Voorhees said, outweigh the council's concerns about the provisions that allow the state to purchase natural gas pipeline capacity to compensate for a marketplace that has been slow to make infrastructure investments that allow more natural gas to flow Maine's way.
\
""This bill has a chance of passing in a bipartisan way,"" Voorhees said.

Do they all think it must be CMP's fault and that by attacking this electricity distributor, the problem bills will magically go away?\It is now an emergency situation and calls for an emergency response.\The legislators are very aware of the Efficiency Maine Trust and the revenue the trust receives from the system benefit charge, a parasite attachment raising the bills of the poor and not-so-poor.\But are they aware that Efficiency Maine is playing the ISO-New England Forward Capacity Market with this revenue to enrich itself with an additional $13.89 million while the poorest among us struggle with a crippling $150-per-year addition to their bills? The $13.89 million is what the market saves when Efficiency Maine clients use more-efficient electrical devices; this money is remitted not to the clients, but to Efficiency Maine Trust.\The right thing to do now is to eliminate the system benefit charge.

414,"AUGUSTA, Maine -- A $29 million emergency spending bill called for by Gov. Paul LePage became law on Wednesday without the governor's signature.\LePage's office said Thursday that the reason he didn't sign the bill is because it includes money for Efficiency Maine, which uses taxpayer funds to administer energy-efficiency programs in Maine.\LePage spokeswoman Adrienne Bennett told the Associated Press that LePage is concerned about Maine's high energy costs, which he said are 11th highest in the nation.\The $664,000 in current-year funding for the Efficiency Maine Trust that was included in the bill -- which is now in law without LePage's signature -- is exactly as the LePage administration proposed it. According to both the original bill and chaptered law, the money is meant to help the Efficiency Maine Trust program ""align with projected natural gas assessments.""\The bill includes pretty much everything the governor asked for in his proposal plus $4.8 million in grant funding to provide opiate addiction treatment to at least 400 Mainers this year. That funding deal was negotiated between Democrats and Mary Mayhew, LePage's health and human services commissioner.\The budget also funnels $7.1 million to the University of Maine system, which LePage promised last year in exchange for the system maintaining a tuition freeze; $7 million to keep the Limestone-based Maine Military Authority refurbishing transit buses; and $4.9 million to support fish hatcheries.\The package also transfers $35 million in surplus funds to the Budget Stabilization Fund, which has long been another LePage priority.\Efficiency Maine, which funds weatherization and heating efficiency programs, has been a target of LePage in the past. In 2013, he proposed cutting some funding for those programs in favor of rerouting funding to curtail electricity rates for select industries. That bill died in committee.\LePage has long argued against virtually any measure that increases electricity costs at all. The Efficiency Maine Trust, established in 2009, is funded primarily through a ""system benefit charge"" assessed on all Maine electricity ratepayers, along with proceeds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\In 2015, LePage opposed a bill that sought to correct what was widely described as a typo, which would have cost Efficiency Maine roughly $38 million. He instead supported a competing bill in which House Republicans attempted to create a Maine Department of Energy. The original bill was enacted despite a LePage veto.\Practically speaking, the end result is the same with or without LePage's signature: the bill is law.\LePage has withheld his signature or vetoed budget bills going back years, allowing him the flexibility to take credit for items like the university tuition freeze but distance himself from others, such as bailing out the Maine Military Authority on a contract he temporarily halted in September 2016 because of cost overruns.\Credit: Christopher Cousins BDN Staff"

416,"AUGUSTA - The Baldacci administration released additional details Wednesday about a package of initiatives that officials hope will foster greater energy independence in Maine while at the same time creating thousands of new jobs.\Gov. John Baldacci announced the proposed initiatives during his State of the State speech Tuesday night. On Wednesday he said that a one-stop-shop within state government of energy programs would be aimed at making it easier for home or business owners to get the help they need to make their buildings more energy efficient.\Currently, energy programs are scattered among several state agencies.\Coupled with the reorganization of energy programs under one umbrella, the state plans to work with banks and credit unions to guarantee up to $100 million in weatherization loans.\The banks and credit unions will still do the lending, but having the state sign on as a backer of those loans gives financial institutions incentive to increase the size of the pot of money, according to the governor and his aides.\Between the private loans and $32 million in federal stimulus money, the state hopes to conduct 20 times as many weatherization projects as are done now as part of a goal to increase the efficiency of all Maine homes in 20 years.\""It's a very ambitious goal but I think you have to set those kinds of goals,"" the governor said Wednesday.\Another significant initiative that Baldacci discussed during Tuesday's speech was a plan to investigate locating new high-capacity electrical transmission lines within highway rights of way.\On Wednesday, Maine Department of Transportation officials signed a memorandum of understanding with Bangor Hydro-Electric Co. to study whether transmission lines could be buried along the interstate corridors between South Orrington and the New Hampshire border.\Co-locating would reduce construction costs, lessen environmental impacts and allow the utility to avoid the potentially contentious process of routing through hundreds or even thousands of different properties. Utility officials said new transmission lines are required to bolster the Maine grid's reliability and to accommodate the explosion in renewable energy projects proposed for the state.\""It just makes sense all around if we can make it work,"" said Bangor Hydro spokeswoman Susan Faloon.\Bruce Van Note, deputy commissioner for operations and budget at the DOT, said a few other states, but not many, already use highway corridors for transmission lines. The 120-day study will determine whether to proceed to the next step with federal highway administrators.\""Long corridors are difficult to come by and if there is one there, why not use it for more"" than just transportation, asked Van Note.\The Baldacci administration also is talking with Canadian authorities about the possibility of a second energy corridor between Maine and New Brunswick as well as alternative ways to connect Northern Maine to the New England grid. The Public Utilities Commission earlier dismissed a project that would have connected Aroostook County to the rest of Maine's power grid after unanticipated technical hurdles were discovered.\But the governor's energy initiatives have plenty of company - or competition - in the State House this session.\Legislative leaders have been working for some time on a package that includes many of the same proposals, including using highway corridors for transmission lines.\And on Wednesday, a legislative committee heard testimony on a bill, LD 866, that would create and fund a heating oil efficiency program similar to the state's Efficiency Maine program for electricity.\Revenues from a controversial ""system benefit charge"" on heating oil - similar to those levied on electricity and natural gas - would help consumers save an estimated $1 billion in heating oil costs, according to the bill's sponsor, House Speaker Hannah Pingree. The charge would start out at 2.5 cents per gallon and would be paid by wholesalers, who will presumably pass the costs along to consumers.\""This will allow Maine people and businesses to save their money and invest it in their families or employees,"" Pingree, D-North Haven, said about her weatherization and efficiency bill. ""This will also allow the creation of new long-term industries and jobs. When this program is fully in place, we will have gone a long way to addressing a critical, structural challenge for our families, our businesses, our environment, and our economy."""
417,"
This past month, I testified in support of three major bills at the Legislature: LD 886, sponsored by House Speaker Hannah Pingree, D-North Haven, LD 1181, sponsored by Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, and LD 1201, emergency legislation presented by Gov. John Baldacci, each of which proposes to strengthen energy efficiency programs for Maine business, industry and residents.
\
The Joint Select Committee on Maine's Energy Future has dispensed with these bills and is poised to propose a composite bill that incorporates the best features from all three. While I am no longer Maine's Public Advocate, I still take consumer protection seriously. In particular, I'd like to address the opportunity to make a comprehensive weatherization strategy work for Maine's many low-income households.
\
Currently, Maine relies exclusively on federal funds for low-income weatherization. Historically, we have weatherized fewer than 1,000 homes each year, out of roughly 120,000 low-income homes that are eligible for heating fuel assistance. Today, there is a 10-year waiting list for homes already identified as needing weatherization. These are homes that every winter inefficiently uses both the homeowner's own money and public LIHEAP assistance.
\
Given the current pace of weatherization with federal funds, it will take a century to help all the low-income households reduce their heating expenses significantly. We do not have a century to do this. In fact, we may have only a few years before prices rise again and Maine's household budgets are stretched to the breaking point. If something is to be done now, what will be the costs and benefits of a ""Weatherize Maine"" strategy?
\
One legislative proposal would generate funding to weatherize at least half of Maine's poorly-insulated housing stock by 2020, for Mainers at all income levels, as well as thousands of commercial buildings. This would include all of the 60,000 homes receiving fuel assistance. For oil-heated households, the expected 30 percent reduction in usage from weatherization will amount to an average $550 savings in the annual oil bill, when prices are $2 per gallon - if prices stay at the level they reached in 2008, the average annual savings would be nearly $1,300.
\
The programs proposed in Augusta seek to ensure that homes needing weatherization first get an energy audit and then necessary insulation, air sealing and heating system improvements. Eligible low-income households would receive this at no cost. Other households would receive technical assistance from certified professionals, as well as financial assistance, and be expected to pay 75 percent of the cost themselves.
\
Program funds could come from the same source most other states use to fund efficiency programs for electricity and natural gas - a ""System Benefit Charge"" that is paid per-barrel of fuel entering the state. This is a dedicated surcharge solely used to support efficiency programs that directly benefit consumers.
\
One legislative proposal would increase the retail cost of heating oil by a few cents per gallon over the next 10 years, costing the average heating oil customer less than $2 per month. This is about a one percent cost increase - natural gas consumers already pay 3 percent and receive the benefits of efficiency programs designed for them.
\
One point is inescapable: under the proposed legislation, customers at all income levels have to share in the cost, from $20 to $40 annually and depending on consumption. That is why the bills propose to provide a full rebate of that amount to each low-income household until their home is weatherized.
\
When you consider the benefits and the costs, something like this initiative is clearly needed at this time. There is one important word of caution, however: we need to commit enough funding so that the multi-year benefits of Maine's efficiency strategy are fully realized.
\
The worst outcome would occur if Maine relied on short-term federal stimulus funding in order to launch weatherization programs and energy workforce development only to see these efforts evaporate when the stimulus expires.
\
To succeed at this will take patience and commitment. But it is long past time for Maine to continue tolerating a 10-year wait for weatherizing the homes of low-income families who are eligible, but for whom there is no available funding.
\
Maine can - and should - do better.Stephen Ward of Newcastle served as Maine's Public Advocate from 1997 to 2007.

418,"AUGUSTA, Maine -- The Legislature's Energy Committee unveiled a multipronged bill Tuesday that incorporates elements from nine different measures aimed at expanding Maine's natural gas infrastructure, boosting funding for energy efficiency, directly lowering businesses' electricity costs and making it more affordable for residents to abandon oil heat.\The combined bill includes provisions from legislation proposed by Gov. Paul LePage and Democratic and Republican members of the Legislature. It has elements designed to appeal to LePage, who has emphasized policies that directly reduce energy costs, and Democrats and environmental groups, who have advocated for investments in energy efficiency.\""It's a fairly significant piece of work,"" said Sen. John Cleveland, D-Auburn, the committee's Senate chairman.\The bill includes an overarching focus on reducing energy costs while directing more funding to the Efficiency Maine Trust over the next two years for programs that would help industrial facilities cut back on greenhouse gas emissions. Efficiency Maine, under the newly crafted bill, would also be charged with administering a program suggested in legislation from LePage that offers homeowners rebates to help them convert to more efficient home heating systems.\""We know many people are paying heating costs that are high and that, for many people, it's not affordable,"" Cleveland said. ""We recognize that efficiency is important to do.""\With natural gas, the committee's legislation incorporates pieces from two bills sponsored by House Republican Leader Rep. Kenneth Fredette of Newport that could lead to the state partially financing a buildout of pipeline infrastructure in southern New England so more natural gas can make its way into the regional electric grid and reduce electricity costs in Maine.\The Energy Committee bill would allow the state to issue bonds -- through the Finance Authority of Maine -- to buy natural gas pipeline capacity for the state and assist other states in pipeline projects that could benefit Maine. The bill would also let the state enter into energy cost-reduction contracts with natural gas generators by selling state-owned pipeline capacity in exchange for rates that reduce electricity costs.\In addition, the bill would let the Maine Public Utilities Commission order natural gas utilities to connect their pipelines -- and pay them to do it -- when those additional connections could expand the availability of natural gas in the state.\Cleveland said those measures are designed to compensate for a marketplace that has been slow to make infrastructure investments that allow more natural gas to flow Maine's way.\""We believe there's a market failure,"" he said. ""Our preference is that the marketplace will come forward to address this need and the failure in the marketplace, but currently because of the nature of the market, that is not occurring.""\About a third of Maine's electricity today comes from natural gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. If additional pipeline capacity allows more natural gas to flow toward Maine and New England from the Marcellus Shale rock formation -- which covers much of New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia -- Maine could be better insulated from electricity price swings that occur when pipeline capacity is nearly maxed out, said Public Utilities Commission Chairman Thomas Welch.\Maine wouldn't be assuming full responsibility for building pipeline infrastructure, Welch said, but the state's participation would help spur pipeline construction.\""There are a lot of people looking at that gas, and we're putting ourselves at a competitive disadvantage if we don't get it,"" Welch told lawmakers.\The Energy Committee bill is the result of a collaboration that has involved Cleveland; Rep. Barry Hobbins, D-Saco, the Energy Committee's House chairman; Republican committee members Sen. Edward Youngblood of Brewer and Rep. Larry Dunphy of Embden; Welch; Patrick Woodcock, who directs LePage's energy office; and representatives from industry and environmental groups.\The bill addresses how the state divvies up two major energy-related revenue streams: funds Maine receives from carbon emission allowance auctions through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, and $82 million the federal government has paid Maine for failing to remove 550 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel that's been sitting at the defunct Maine Yankee nuclear plant since the Wiscasset facility closed in 1996.\LePage had proposed using RGGI auction revenues to directly reduce electricity rates for businesses and to lower residential heating costs by offering homeowners rebates to convert their oil heating systems to more efficient wood pellet, natural gas and propane systems. The funds have traditionally paid for energy efficiency programs run by the Efficiency Maine Trust.\The Energy Committee's bill instead uses half of the RGGI funds for LePage's priorities: 35 percent for the home heating rebate program and 15 percent for electricity rate reductions. The remaining half would be used for electricity efficiency projects at commercial and industrial facilities.\The bill sends 55 percent of Maine Yankee-related lawsuit funds to the Efficiency Maine Trust and uses 45 percent for direct electricity rate reductions. That funding would replace the money Efficiency Maine loses through the proposed elimination of the system benefit charge, which is assessed on businesses to fund conservation and efficiency programs. LePage had proposed eliminating the benefit charge from businesses' electric bill.\Woodcock, LePage's energy director, said the committee bill included ""significant improvements"" over current state energy policy. But he said the legislation needs to focus more on policies that make it easier for homeowners to switch to more affordable heating systems. In addition, LePage would prefer relying on the market rather than the state to expand natural gas pipeline infrastructure, Woodcock said.\Michael Stoddard, executive director of the Efficiency Maine Trust, said increased funding from the bill would free up Efficiency Maine to expand its focus beyond projects focused solely on electricity conservation.\The Energy Committee expects to make amendments to its bill and send it to the full Legislature in the coming days.\Credit: Matthew Stone BDN Staff"

420,"AUGUSTA - A legislative committee on Thursday endorsed a massive energy bill that would revamp Maine's efficiency and conservation programs but could slow down Gov. John Baldacci's plan for ""energy corridors"" through the state.\The omnibus bill recommended by the Energy Futures Committee establishes ambitious goals for moving Maine toward greater energy independence while creating new initiatives within state government to funnel money into energy programs.\Revenues for the programs would come from a variety of sources, including federal stimulus funds, bonds, leases of state-owned land for energy transmission, and potentially additional fees tacked onto heating oil.\But the bill also reflects cross-border tensions with Canadian officials over energy issues.\Committee members opted for a more cautious approach toward Baldacci's energy corridor proposal in part because of anger over Canadian threats to block liquefied natural gas tankers from accessing import terminals proposed for Down East Maine. Canadian officials have cited safety concerns about tankers passing through Head Harbor Passage en route to the Calais area, but advocates for the LNG proposals accuse Canada of trying to protect its own burgeoning energy industry.\""Maine should not simply be a pathway for them to get their power out of New Brunswick without us seeing some benefit from it,"" said Rep. John Martin, an Eagle Lake Democrat and the committee's co-chairman. New Brunswick-based Irving Oil has expressed interest in the energy corridors.\The version of the bill endorsed by the majority of the committee Thursday would create a commission to study how Maine could maximize the benefits of leasing the state's highway corridors for energy transmission projects.\Irving and Bangor Hydro-Electric Co. are already exploring leasing the interstate corridors as potential routes for large transmission lines with fewer environmental headaches or tussles with landowners. In return, the state could conceivably receive tens of millions of dollars annually for energy conservation, efficiency and weatherization.\As written, the bill prohibits the state from signing any leases on energy corridor projects until a law is put in place governing the agreements. But it would not prohibit companies from exploring the issue or even applying for environmental permits.\""When you are entering into these large agreements that are going to forever change the energy dynamics in the state, you want to make sure you get everything you can out of it,"" said Sen. Phil Bartlett, a Gorham Democrat and committee co-chairman.\John Kerry, head of the state's Office of Energy Independence and Security, said overall the bill is a positive step that will redefine the state's framework on energy efficiency and conservation.\Kerry said he does not believe the energy infrastructure commission would be a problem because permitting and project development take a long time. In the meantime, it is important that the state continues to send a positive message to potential developers.\The bill lays out a series of goals for the state. Those include:\. Weatherizing all Maine homes and 50 percent of businesses by 2030.\. Reducing peak-load electricity usage by 100 megawatts by 2020.\. Reducing consumption of liquid fossil fuels by at least 30 percent by 2030 and of heating oil in particular by 20 percent by 2020.\Bartlett, who is also Senate majority leader, called the measure an incredibly important bill ""that will change the way we do energy efficiency ... and lay the groundwork for Maine to be more energy-independent.""\The bill also establishes the Efficiency Maine Trust to oversee development and implementation of energy programs. Additional programs would offer rebates to homeowners who purchase solar energy systems and expand training for careers in installation of alternative energy sources, weatherization and energy auditing.\Funding for the programs would come from a variety of sources, including: federal stimulus dollars, proceeds from carbon dioxide emission allowances sold through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a $30 million bond and the interstate lease projects.\One option that the Efficiency Maine Trust would explore is imposing a surcharge on No. 2 heating oil, kerosene and propane with proceeds going into heating fuel efficiency and weatherization programs. The state also imposes such fees, known as a ""system benefit charge,"" on electricity.\The newly formed committee reviewed dozens of energy-related bills, borrowing ideas from some for the current bill and rejecting others.\Dylan Voorhees, clean energy and global warming project director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, called the bill ""quite a remarkable achievement"" that takes a significant step in ramping up Maine's efforts on energy efficiency and weatherization.\But Voorhees pointed out that the state still has to identify a long-term funding solution for all of these programs. Federal stimulus dollars, while helpful in the short term, will not spark significant long-term growth in Maine's energy efficiency industry, he said."
421,"INSIDE An AP study finds tax exemptions far exceed Maine's $1 billion budget deficit.4B; ""We need legislation for keeping this stuff out of Maine's landfills and out of the incinerators, but also to make sure it goes to proper recycling."" Michael Belliveau, Environmental Health Strategy Center\ Ever wonder what happens to old computers when they die?\ Chances are they end up in a landfill, or worse, on a container ship bound for a developing country, where they are dismantled. Anywhere they land, they are an environmental hazard: The average computer is chock-full of toxic materials, including mercury, cadmium, brominated flame retardant and several pounds of lead.\ This winter state lawmakers will consider an electronics waste bill that would require computer manufacturers to take responsibility for the safe disposal of their products. It's one of dozens of environmental bills that the Maine Legislature will debate during this legislative session.\ Other environmental measures will tackle the sweeping topics of climate change and energy conservation, both part of a larger effort to develop a comprehensive energy plan for Maine. Some bills will revisit controversial issues left unresolved last year, such as the cut-and-run forestry practice known as liquidation harvesting. And a five-year battle over how to protect small streams from the impact of timber harvesting may finally come to an end.\ There will be several more bills dealing with the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, and several that aim to expand the state's effort to fight mercury pollution. Arsenic contamination in drinking water and on the playground will also be a target.\ The electronics waste bill, sponsored by Rep. Judd Thompson, D- China, will attempt to deal with a problem that is growing with every upgrade.\ ""The National Academy of Sciences estimates that within a few years there will be 500 million obsolete computers in the United States alone,"" said Pete Didisheim, advocacy director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine.\ Many people and businesses believe that taking their old equipment to a computer recycler solves the toxics problem, but Didisheim said that 80 percent of the computers that are recycled end up on container ships and are taken to China, India and Pakistan. There they are dismantled ""in horrific conditions,"" he said, with some components being recycled while other parts - even those that are toxic - are burned or boiled.\ Sending the problem overseas is ""not the right thing to do,"" said Michael Belliveau, executive director of the Environmental Health Strategy Center.\ ""We need legislation for keeping this stuff out of Maine's landfills and out of the incinerators, but also to make sure it goes to proper recycling,"" he said. ""Ideally, the manufacturer ought to take responsibility for the toxic impacts of their products at the end of their life.""\ Energy efficiency\ Other bills that are likely to get a lot of attention address energy efficiency standards and the problem of climate change. They are part of an effort to develop an energy plan for Maine, and many of their provisions are based on a report published last year by the Maine Center for Economic Policy, the Natural Resources Council of Maine and the Mainewatch Institute.\ Senate Majority Leader Sharon Treat, D-Farmingdale, is sponsoring an omnibus energy bill that she said would save both energy and money at a time when the country is thinking about war, oil prices are rising, and there is widespread economic uncertainty.\ ""I can't stress enough how energy costs are one of the single biggest drivers of business costs here in the state of Maine, and it's an area where our costs are significantly higher than other areas of the country,"" Treat said. ""Anything we can do that reduces those costs is certainly worth looking at.""\ The energy bill would increase funding for energy efficiency programs by establishing a statewide system benefit charge. It would also establish new appliance standards for 10 products that are not covered by federal standards.\ Those products are ceiling fans and ceiling fan light kits; commercial clothes washers; commercial refrigerators and freezers; illuminated exit signs; large packaged air conditioning equipment; low-voltage, dry-type distribution transformers; set-top boxes for cable TV; torchiere lighting fixtures; traffic signal modules; and unit heaters.\ According to a report done by Maine's public advocate, the state could save more than $500 million in energy costs through 2020 by improving and increasing its energy efficiency programs.\ ""One thing about these energy efficiency standards is there may be an up-front cost, but frequently over a couple of years you actually save significant amounts of money,"" Treat said.\ ""Part of the difficulty is that we have a state government that operates on a two-year budget cycle, so we can't always look ahead the way we want to. This legislation is about encouraging the state to look a little farther down the road.""\ Treat's bill would also encourage energy-efficient building construction and increase renewable energy by rewriting the state's renewable portfolio standard.\ A renewable portfolio standard is a legal requirement that any electricity sold in the state must include a certain amount of renewable energy. Maine has a high standard - 30 percent - but it allows the burning of tires and coal-fired cogeneration to be counted as renewable energy.\ ""We think there's a big problem with that,"" said Sue Jones of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, who helped draft the bill. ""We would like to see the definitions (of renewable energy) change. We would also like to see the percentage be meaningful. It should drive new renewables development in the state of Maine.""\ Climate change\ Another proposal would tackle energy issues from a different angle, addressing the threat of climate change.\ Last week, Maine announced that it intends to join Massachusetts and Connecticut in a lawsuit against the Bush administration for its refusal to regulate carbon dioxide, a major cause of global warming, as a pollutant. Yet Maine itself is lagging far behind other states in its own efforts to deal with climate change. Maine is the only New England state, for example, that has not yet developed a climate change action plan.\ That would change under a bill that's being sponsored by Rep. Theodore Koffman, D-Bar Harbor, chair of the natural resources committee. Koffman has a big interest in climate change policy. He served on the state's climate change task force a few years ago and is a part of a small nonprofit group called Maine Global Climate Change Inc.\ ""Climate change continues to be, I think, one of the most significant threats to Maine and to the country,"" Koffman said, ""and it's only going to get tougher.""\ Changes in weather patterns, the northward migration of insect pests, the potential transformation of Maine's forests, and sea- level rise that contributes to erosion and loss in real estate values could all have tremendous impacts on Maine's economy, Koffman said.\ Given the current state of the economy, it's probably more practical to take an incremental approach to addressing these threats, he said, ""but we can't back away from these issues.""\ Koffman's bill would require Maine to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. These reductions would be achieved by following a short-term plan that would be developed by the end of the year. Emissions would be tracked through a mandatory registry.\ The state would also be required to create by 2006 a long-term climate action plan consistent with the goals established by the New England governors and eastern Canadian premiers. Those goals envision greenhouse gas emissions that, by 2020, are at least 10 percent less than 1990 levels.\ Maine's state government would be required to create its own emissions inventory and to develop a plan to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2010.\ Another part of the bill would require all major development projects to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions during the permitting process.\ ""The idea would be down the road to have some sense of accountability and accounting of greenhouse gases in the future,"" said Jones of the Natural Resources Council. ""If a new turnpike is put in, a shopping mall, those increases in greenhouse gases need to be counted.""\ Koffman said he hopes the debate over his bill will help to educate people about the threat of climate change and convince them to take the issue more seriously.\ ""At this point, we're not feeling the pain,"" Koffman said. ""Mercury was a similar kind of issue. While the scientific community understood the toxicity of mercury and what it would do to humans, it's invisible. And it wasn't until the fish advisories came out in Maine, about pregnant women and children eating freshwater fish that had accumulated mercury, that the public began to pay some real attention.""\ Mercury pollution is going to be back in the public eye this session with several new bills, some of which build upon previous legislation that phased out the sale of some mercury-containing products in the state.\ The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has submitted a new report to the Legislature with proposed legislation attached that would prohibit the sale of mercury-containing switches, measuring devices and relays. Measuring devices that contain mercury include products such as barometers and blood pressure cuffs.\ ""We did quite a lot of homework on what the marketplace can provide in terms of non-mercury alternatives and whether there would be particular hardships posed by these kind of prohibitions,"" said David Lennett, director of the DEP's Bureau of Remediation and Waste Management. ""We also circulated a draft report on our strategy widely within Maine and outside of Maine for comment, so this issue I think has been significantly vetted before it goes to the Legislature.""\ A law passed last year that requires the removal of mercury switches from old cars before they are scrapped has come under fire from automakers, who are now suing the state over the issue. Automakers are required to pay for the program, which began Jan. 1.\ Automakers are also considering submitting their own bill to the Legislature that would make changes to the program. If such a bill is submitted, the DEP ""intends to oppose that rather vigorously,"" Lennett said.\ ""We think the automakers should be responsible in large part for the problem they created,"" he said.\ Staff Writer Meredith Goad can be contacted at 791-6332 or at:\ mgoad@pressherald.com"
