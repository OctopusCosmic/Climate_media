0,"The Fort Collins Sustainability Group, or FCSG, recently sent the following letter to Sen. Michael Bennet:\Thank you for meeting with members of the Fort Collins environmental community on Jan. 5. The FCSG appreciated the opportunity to share our thoughts and to hear those of others on critical environmental issues.\We'd like to highlight the following ideas brought forward during that meeting:\The carbon emissions reductions in proposed Senate legislation are insufficient to keep global climate change in check.\At a minimum, the United States should reduce its carbon emissions by 35 percent by 2020 with respect to current levels, as recommended by the Union of Concerned Scientists.\A carbon tax may be superior to the ""cap and trade"" policy the Senate is currently considering. Proceeds from such a tax could be redistributed or used to develop infrastructure to help us break our dependence on fossil fuels.\A national renewable energy standard and feed-in tariffs would promote the use of renewable energy.\Mass transit, including Front Range commuter rail would help lower carbon emissions in the transport sector.\Addressing global climate change is critical in order to avoid environmental catastrophe and also provides an opportunity to put people back to work. After the economic meltdown of 2008, it's clear that the ""free market"" is incapable of providing for the common welfare by itself. The government has an important role to play both in creating employment and addressing environmental problems. The climate bill should do both of these things.\Kevin Cross, convener, on behalf of the Fort Collins Sustainability Group"
1,"""Cap and trade"": Polls show few Americans know what it means, even though it would be the most significant environmental legislation to come out of Congress in recent history.\Colorado Springs Utilities officials say they know what the climate change legislation means: much higher utility bills for customers. \Utilities officials are waging a battle, from YouTube to the halls of Congress, against cap and trade. \""The current bills have real winners and losers and unfortunately Colorado and Colorado Springs are net losers,"" said Utilities CEO Jerry Forte, who last week went to Washington, D.C., to urge Colorado's U.S. senators to back a different approach to climate change. His YouTube video on cap and trade has received 227 views.\The Senate held hearings last week on a Democrat-backed bill, and the House of Representatives passed cap-and-trade legislation in June. Both would set a cap on carbon dioxide emissions, and utilities would have to buy credits on a credit market for emissions above what they are allocated, the ""trade"" aspect. \The financial impact for Utilities could be major. While many utilities have been moving toward renewable energy in recent years, Colorado Springs still generates 70 percent of its power from coal, compared with the national average of 56 percent, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\Utilities has enough of a renewable portfolio to meet state requirements, but as the nation has moved toward regulations on emissions of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, Utilities officials have put their stock in developing technology to capture carbon emissions from plants, technology not yet usable on a large scale. \Now that a cap-and-trade system is taking shape, Utilities officials say they are alarmed at its costs.\""When the numbers are crunched and we begin to see the true cost of this kind of legislation to a nation that's in the throes of recession or a real downturn economically, this could be the last straw that really breaks the back,"" Forte said. ""There's a lot of momentum to 'do something' and that's a concern for us, because doing something could be worse than doing nothing.""\A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency analysis said cap-and-trade rules would cost the average American household $100 a year. Utilities officials say the cost here would be higher. \Allowances, or the percentage of utilities' current carbon emissions they could continue releasing, were calculated for each state. The EPA estimated that in 2012, 16 states would get allowances for 100 percent or more of their carbon emissions. But Colorado is 45th on the list of allowances, and utilities here would get allowances for just 55.8 percent. That means utilities would have to scale back coal-based generation or come up with credits for 45 percent of its emissions. It also means utilities in states such as Colorado would compete for credits on the market, sold by utilities and industries generating less emissions than allocated, and prices would skyrocket, said Andy Colosimo, Utilities' manager of government affairs\Utilities officials could not provide an estimate of how much bills would go up here.\""We just don't know, but I think, given our heavy reliance on fossil fuels generation, we don't think that $100 figure is accurate. It may be accurate for some utilities that don't have a carbon exposure, but we do,"" Colosimo said. \Cap-and-trade proponents agree the system would cost ratepayers, but they say the utility industry is using scare tactics.\""Yeah, there will be an impact. But what's the impact of long-term burning of coal, how that impacts our mountain backdrop, our air quality, our way of life here?"" said Richard Skorman, a former Colorado Springs councilman and one-time aide to former Sen. Ken Salazar, of Colorado. He lobbied against a Utilities' proposal to build a coal plant and opened a conservation-oriented hardware store here. \""Keith Hay, clean energy advocate for the group Environment Colorado, said the economic benefit to Colorado would outweigh the costs, because the state has ample renewable energy resources, including solar and wind power. As utilities move toward these renewables, it will mean jobs here, he said.\""The important thing is we are already moving forward to moving off of coal onto clean energy sources. This bill will certainly accelerate that change,"" Hay said. ""Will there be a bump at the beginning? Absolutely. That's why it's important Congress looks at that and looks for ways to smooth out that bump.""\But Utilities says the ""bump"" would be a hardship on residents and businesses, and officials are urging lawmakers to adopt a more phased approach to carbon regulation, to give the industry time to develop technology to capture carbon.\""At some point, we all believed in American ingenuity, that we're going to solve the problem with technology. But it's going to take time to get that tested, developed and deployed,"" Colosimo said. \The chance of climate change legislation being adopted in 2009 appears remote. Democrats in some states, particularly the Midwest, have said they doubt there will be action this year.\Credit: R. SCOTT RAPPOLD; scott.rappold@gazette.com"

Politics dominated the minds of Morgan County Rural Electric Association and Tri-State Generation and Transmission officials during the annual MCREA meeting Saturday at Fort Morgan High School.General Manager Fred Grantham said legislative mandates have added and may yet add more to the cost of electricity, which then must be charged to those who receive association power.The Colorado legislature passed laws requiring power companies to use a certain amount of alternative energy sources in production of electricity, and the U.S. House of Representatives passed a greenhouse gases cap and trade bill, although the U.S. Senate has yet to pass it.Greenhouse gases are among the causes of global warming, and the cap and trade bill would cap the amount of gases such as carbon dioxide which can be created in making electricity.If an electrical company produces too much carbon dioxide, for instance, it might be able to buy carbon credits from another company which is under the cap, and the other company essentially ""trades"" the carbon credits to the electrical company.In the future, it is expected that a long list of substances will be regulated, including ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, ash and water, Grantham said.In addition, regulatory requirements from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency are increasing, Grantham said.Electrical producers are supposed to clamp down on cyber security to make sure no one can access individual accounts for the purposes of identity theft, he said.A truly detailed accounting of costs would list the costs of regulation which are put on top of line items such as purchased power, facilities and personnel costs, Grantham said.If the average residential member of MCREA pays $125 a month for 1,000 kilowatt hours, $90 of that would go to the cost for electrical power -- including for more expensive alternative energy -- $20 for facilities, $10 for regulatory compliance and $5 for forced conservation in building energy efficiency, he claimed.This would make future changes traceable to real influences, Grantham said.Electrical industry officials recognize the need for environmental stewardship, said Ken Anderson, executive vice president and general manager of Tri-State.Tri-State has made investments in a 30-megawatt solar power plant and a large-scale 50-megawatt wind farm in Northeast Colorado, he said.One of its coal-fired plants in Nucla also won an award, Anderson said.However, affordability is a key issue, he said.Trying to meet legislative requirements will add to costs, Anderson said.Transferring from coal to natural gas for producing electricity to avoid greenhouse gases is a difficult transition, and will be expensive, he said. It is a bit like being forced to buy $6 a gallon gasoline when $2.50 gasoline is available.Extending that analogy, renewable energy sources are like $8 to $12 gasoline, Anderson said.Also, policy makers are pushing a two- to four-year timeline for meeting greenhouse gas goals, but it takes eight to 10 years to put more environmentally-friendly plants online, he said.It would be good to have some flexibility to make sure that the road the industry is following is feasible, especially for organizations like Tri-State and MCREA, Anderson said.Electrical cooperatives are in a different position than other utilities systems, Anderson said. For instance, they cannot write off bad decisions coming from legislative changes.Tri-State was able to hold its rates constant in 2010 while natural gas prices were low, but that may not be possible in the future, he said.RatesThe 2010 MCREA budget kept the same electrical rates as 2009, which means the rates will remain the same for two years in a row, said MCREA President Dave Arndt.Since Tri-State did not raise its wholesale power rate and MCREA increased its efficiencies, the association could keep rates stable, he said.However, the association is facing a challenging future, Arndt said.Records show there was a 6 percent decline in usage of electricity in 2009, said Debby Gachne, manager of office services. That was partly because it was a wet year for farmers, who did not have to use their pumps to do as much irrigation compared to previous years.Consequently, MCREA also spent about $500,000 less on buying electrical power in 2009 compared to 2008, she said.However, the cost of buying electricity from Tri-State was still 61.7 percent of the annual expenditure in 2009, she said.Lower usage of electricity does impact revenue, said Treasurer Tim Peggram.Sales of power for use in irrigation went down from 36 percent of the total in 2008 to 32 percent of the total in 2009, which was lower than years before 2008 when irrigation revenue generally exceeded 40 percent of revenue, he said.Better precipitation was not the only factor in that drop, Peggram said.A change in the amount of water available for irrigation also had an impact, and customers are using their water more efficiently, he said.With the percentage of irrigation going down, the percentage of revenue from residential sales went up to 34 percent of total revenue in 2009 compared to 32 percent in 2008, although that was just a return to the 34 percent seen in 2007, Peggram said.Revenue from large and small power users remained stable at 22 percent and 10 percent respectively, he said.MCREA remained in sound financial condition in 2009, with revenue exceeding expenses, Gachne said.Profits and margins are returned to association members in the form of capital credits, and MCREA paid out $450,000 in credit checks to 3,344 members, Peggram said.""This is money in your pockets,"" he said.That is good news, but electrical cooperatives across the U.S. face challenges, especially from the political arena and particularly regarding climate change, Arndt said.He said there has been a shift in public opinion on climate change as measured by some surveys, he said.Those showed that in January 57 percent of the public believed climate change was actually happening, which was down from 71 percent in October 2008, Arndt said.The latest poll also said trust in scientists dropped from 83 percent to 74 percent, and trust in the media dropped from 47 percent to 36 percent, he said.Even those who support the cap and trade system admit it will cause energy costs to rise, Arndt said.Those costs will be transferred to users, meaning larger electrical bills, he said.An instant shift from coal-based power plants to other forms of power is logistically and financially unrealistic, Arndt said.Strides are being made in non-coal-based energy, and 14 percent of Tri-State's power is created with renewable energy resources, he said.""As responsible citizens, we all want to leave the planet in better shape than we found it for our children, grandchildren and so on,"" Arndt said. ""But 'quality of life"" must also include how you are doing today, tomorrow, next month, next year. To place immediate financial burdens on our membership goes directly against our mission.""Arndt said he believed that the nation needed to strike a balance between global warming concerns and financial concerns.Member activityThere was only one contested director seat in the election Saturday, as MCREA voters took their turns in the voting booths set up near the registration desks.Randolph Graff contested the seat of incumbent Secretary Ronald Hocheder and won with 459 votes to Hocheder's 362.Brian Schlagel was re-elected with 699 votes and Larry Hoozee was re-elected with 694 votes.One way of reducing electricity consumption is to use energy-efficient methods of using it, including switching to fluorescent light bulbs, closely monitoring and using power off the peak demand hours, using infrared heaters or installing energy-efficient water heaters, Grantham said.Using an electronic polling system, the members at the meeting indicated that 42 percent of them used more than one of those methods, 17 percent switched to fluorescent bulbs and 16 percent more closely monitored their electrical use. Only 8 percent said they did not take any steps.However, the membership at the meeting was split over climate change.About 47 percent indicated they do not believe climate change exists or that it was not very important.Another 46 percent responded that it is very important or somewhat important.At the same time, 63 percent indicated MCREA should make cost the determining factor on whether or not to support or oppose any legislative measures concerning climate change, and another 24 percent indicated the association should oppose any climate change measures regardless of the cost.Nine percent remained neutral and 4 percent indicated the association should support climate change measures regardless of the cost.Another poll showed 56 percent of the members at the meeting considered cost the top concern about electricity, while 23 percent were most concerned about reliability, 12 percent about future availability, 5 percent about safety and 4 percent about impact on the environment.The overwhelming majority of the members at the meeting were more than 36 years old, with more at the older ages.They also said the most important issues to them were the economy and employment at 37 percent and health care at 32 percent, with energy down at 9 percent.About 18 percent believed MCREA had raised rates even though publications have said it had not.Half of those at the meeting indicated MCREA should reconsider the way it gets its revenue from the members, 37 percent were not sure and 13 percent said they did not want the association to reconsider electrical rates.They also indicated it was time to identify individual costs through rates, instead of having an averaged rate, with 55 percent saying to change, 27 percent not wanting change and 17 percent not sure.One of the questions MCREA faces is whether or not to have a flat rate for customers each month, which may mean costs of up to $200 a month, or to charge by kilowatt hour, Grantham said.Xcel Energy now has a two-tiered rate system, in which the first 500 kilowatts of electricity have a lower rate and electricity after that is more expensive, Grantham said.""In my mind, that is a forced conservation,"" he said.One of the problems with that kind of system is that it favors richer customers, Grantham said. Those who cannot afford to put in better insulation, energy-efficient appliances or take other measures pay more than those who can afford them.MCREA plans to do a detailed study on whether or not the rate structure it has is fair, he said.Members at the meeting indicated they were in favor of investigating rate design options, although 36 percent said it needed more investigation.""We know we're not the cheapest, but we're working on it,"" Grantham said.-- Contact Dan Barker at business@fmtimes.com.

Progressive 15 members talked about a number of issues while discussing agriculture, water and natural resources last week -- including one practical way to manage water on the South Platte River.
\
The South Platte Water Cooperative is working on finding ways to use the excess water that goes unused during wet years, said Jim Yahn, who works with the cooperative and is the chairman of the South Platte Water Roundtable.
\
Growers along the South Platte have been doing a lot of recharge to groundwater to replace water that is pumped out of wells, he said. However, that is not always efficient.
\
There is excess water sometimes, which gives water owners some water trade credits, Yahn said.
\
Those credits often cannot be used in a timely fashion, but the cooperative is trying to find ways to use those credits for producers to earn income, he said.
\
It might be possible, for instance, for cooperative members to lease water credits to cities or factories upstream from where the farmers have their land, Yahn said.
\
Taking the water out of the river higher up its slope would offer cities and industry cleaner water and growers would receive payments for their water credits, he said.
\
In addition, it may be possible to save some water credits for local industry, such as ethanol plants, to use, Yahn said.
\
He said he would like the water to stay in the area if there is a use for it.
\
Currently, water districts -- some of which are districts in name only, and really water speculators -- have been coming to Northeast Colorado to buy up water rights for cities, he said. When that happens, the water is lost to the area permanently.
\
Under this proposal, growers would retain control of water, Yahn said.
\
""This is farmer based, owned and operated,"" he said.
\
If Northeast Colorado growers do not do something, water will continue to go to cities like Aurora that are buying up water aggressively, he said. Cities will target agricultural water.
\
One mayor told him that cities will get water one way or another, said Washington County Commissioner David Foy.
\
Water storage is necessary for this to have its full impact, but cities may be able to hold the water in their reservoirs, he said.
\
If farmers enter into agreements to provide leased water, they might have to agree to provisions that they provide water each year, which might mean that in dry years they would not have water for their crops, Yahn said. However, that might not happen often and the payments every year would be a steady supply of cash.
\
Since the South Platte is a major economic driver in Northern Colorado, this is a great idea, Foy said.
\
""It is really exciting,"" said Lisa Darling, co-chair of the resource committee. ""Innovation is starting to happen.""
\
Planners will have to look for the way to use water to its greatest value, while finding a way to satisfy both farmers and cities, she said.
\
Cap and trade
\
Committee members were not as thrilled by the idea of legislation proposed to cap the amount of carbon dioxide that could be emitted by factories and other sources and a system which would allow those who produce fewer greenhouse gases to sell credits to those who are producing too many.
\
Members considered making a resolution against cap and trade measures, with mention of some provisions which must be put into any legislation if it is to be complete, but several people said that could backfire.
\
Heidi Wagner, a government relations analyst for an energy company, who said she was speaking on her own and not reflecting the company`s views, said the U.S. Congress might not pass a cap and trade bill any time soon given the current political climate.
\
If such legislation is passed, it would be good to include certain parameters to protect industry and agriculture, but to mention that too soon could have an effect opponents of cap and trade would not like, she said.
\
If those in Congress receive a list of things that any cap and trade bill must include, they may decide that if they include those they can pass a bill, Wagner said.
\
In other words, this kind of resolution might encourage a cap and trade bill.
\
It might be better to circulate the ideas among opponents for the time being, and be ready in case a cap and trade bill comes forward, but not start bringing the ideas to legislators yet, Wagner said.
\
Saying these ideas are important might send the message that if certain things are included in the bill, previous opponents could support a bill, said Sue Jarrett, an activist for ag issues.
\
It would be better to somehow say, ""We`re opposed to cap and trade, but ... these are the guidelines if implemented.""
\
Unfortunately, Wagner said, the Environmental Protection Agency is moving forward with regulations that would have the same effect under the Clean Air Act.
\
It might be worthwhile to craft a resolution opposing EPA regulations, she said.
\
There is danger for cap and trade opponents in waiting, because the current administration is using its authority to move the cap and trade ideas, said Abel Chavez, another industry representative who said he was speaking on his own behalf, not that of his company.
\
Opponents of cap and trade may not be able to stop it if they allow either legislation or administrative policies to put it in place, he said.
\
The best thing would be for the U.S. Congress to pass a bill halting further EPA regulations on greenhouse gases for the time being, Wagner said.
\
While cap and trade might benefit some farmers who can claim carbon credits for their fields, that could backfire if legislation started targeting agricultural sources of greenhouse gases such as cattle, some said.
\
Progressive 15 Executive Director Cathy Shull said that it would be to opponents` advantage to send a different message to legislators. Opponents may not get anywhere trying to stop cap and trade, but they could direct it in ways which are profitable or least not economically harmful.
\
Darling suggested that Progressive 15 might want to support an agricultural exemption from cap and trade.
\
Some people in agriculture want the label of cap and trade eradicated and have greenhouse gas opponents concentrate on more ecologically damaging gases than carbon dioxide, Foy said.
\
The definition of what cap and trade means could be the main difficulty, he said.
\
Animal ID
\
Committee members voted 14-2 to reauthorize Progressive 15`s resolution supporting a mandatory national identification program for livestock, despite some opposition.
\
The resolution reads that since beef, pork and lamb industries depend on consumer confidence in food safety, it is important to support it.
\
Numerous foreign countries are competing for a share of the global market, and some trade partners are demanding a tracking system, it says.
\
The resolution was up for a five-year extension, but Jarrett opposed it on behalf of the Independent Cattleman`s Association.
\
Animal identification and tracking is costly and burdensome, especially for small producers, she said.
\
Australia passed a form of animal identification and is regretting it now, Jarrett said.
\
Every time an animal is transferred somewhere, that must be recorded which is a time-consuming regulatory burden, she said.
\
However, it can be costly not to have animal identification, said Morgan County Commissioner Laura Teague.
\
She has a ranch that borders another ranch, and without identification she could not move her cattle, she said.
\
When bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as ""mad cow disease,"" was discovered, officials could not know with certainty where it originated, which was a huge cost to the cattle industry, Teague said.
\
She would much rather have to do identification with her cattle identified as not having mad cow disease, she said.
\
Committee members were asked to send in recommendations about the current list of Progressive 15 agricultural principles.
\
Shull said she wanted to know if there was anything missing or if something should be said another way.
\
Principles says that a profitable sustainable agricultural system:
\
Is important to Northeast Colorado.
\
Is a part of homeland security.
\
Is necessary for an inexpensive, quality and safe food supply.
\
Protects land, water and environment.
\
Is based on prudent use of renewable and/or recyclable resources.
\
Improves the quality of life of individuals and communities.
\
Is guided by a land ethic that considers the long-term good of all members of the land community.
\
Those who wish to make recommendations can send suggestions to cathy@sagestrategies.biz or shullent@twol.com. Progressive 15 members talked about a number of issues while discussing agriculture, water and natural resources last week -- including one practical way to manage water on the South Platte River.

From California to Colorado and from Washington to New Mexico, Western states, tired of federal inaction on climate change, are saddling up to tackle the issue on their own. Whether it means deciding that a certain percentage of their electrical power has to come from renewable sources, or crafting individual climate change ""action plans,"" many states are working to curb their greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The Western Governors' Association is calling for its members to produce a total of 30,000 megawatts from new renewable energy sources by 2015. By 2020, it's asking states to show a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency. But despite these gestures, the West is still not presenting a unified front on the issue. Instead, it's devised a patchwork of initiatives, with some states, such as Wyoming and Utah, opting not to take any statewide action, and others taking only baby steps. And even in states with ambitious goals, progress has been slow (HCN, 5/2/05).
\
Here's what Western states are doing to cool off: Arizona A renewable portfolio standard requires the state's utilities to purchase 15 percent of Arizona's electricity from renewable sources by 2025; an advisory group convened by Gov. Janet Napolitano, D, is working on a ""climate change action plan,"" due by June 2006, aimed at cutting emissions through improved efficiency and further development of renewables.
\
California A renewable portfolio standard requires electricity retailers to purchase 20 percent of their electricity from renewable resources by 2017. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, R, issued an executive order calling for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to year 2000 levels by 2010, to 1990 levels by 2020, and to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The state Legislature adopted standards calling for tailpipe emissions from new vehicles to be reduced by 22 percent by the 2012 model year, and 30 percent by the 2016 model year.
\
Colorado A voter-mandated renewable portfolio standard will force the state's largest utilities to obtain 3 percent of their electricity from renewable energy resources by 2007, and 10 percent by 2015.
\
Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, R, issued an executive order requiring much of the state's vehicle fleet to run on alternative fuels, such as ethanol.
\
Montana A renewable portfolio standard mandates that 10 percent of the electricity sold in Montana will have to come from renewable sources by 2010, and 15 percent by 2015.
\
Nevada A renewable portfolio standard requires that 20 percent of all electricity generated in Nevada be derived from renewable sources by 2015.
\
New Mexico A renewable portfolio standard will force investor-owned electric utilities to provide 5 percent of their power from renewables by 2006, and 10 percent by 2011. Gov. Bill Richardson issued an executive order directing New Mexico to achieve 2000 emissions levels by 2012, 10 percent below 2000 levels by 2020, and a 75 percent reduction below 2000 emission levels by 2050. New Mexico is also the first state to join the, Chicago Climate Exchange, a voluntary cap-and-trade partnership.
\
Oregon The Legislature has adopted California's emissions standards. Portland has a ""local action plan on global warming,"" which calls for a 10 percent reduction in emissions below 1990 levels by 2010.
\
Utah There is no statewide climate action plan, but Salt Lake City has one of its own, which includes increasing the efficiency of government buildings and encouraging the use of bikes and public transportation.
\
Washington The Legislature adopted California's strict vehicle emission standards and ordered a 20 percent reduction in state vehicles' petroleum use by Sept. 1, 2006. Seattle has required its public utility to achieve zero net emissions of greenhouse gases each year, a goal to be met by offsetting emissions through increased energy efficiency, planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide, and other measures (HCN, 6/27/05).
\
Wyoming The Cowboy State has taken no major actions.

6,"KevinDarst@coloradoan.com\The city of Fort Collins has a stake in both sides of a debate over mercury pollution.\While the city is part of a coalition of cities and counties advocating one set of proposed rules for state mercury regulations, it is also an owner of Platte River Power Authority, the operator of Rawhide Energy Station north of Fort Collins, which advocates a different proposal.\City Council hasn't voted on the issue, other than to review a legislative agenda last summer that included the city's stance.\PRPA hasn't asked its board, which includes two city members, including Mayor Doug Hutchinson and utilities General Manager Mike Smith, to vote on the power provider's position.\Fort Collins, Longmont, Estes Park and Loveland own PRPA.\At issue is the level of mercury pollution reductions the state should require and whether it should allow a cap and trade system that would cap emissions at a certain number and allow power producers who reduce mercury emissions to sell the credits from the reduction.\The state is trying to form its own rule, using a federal rule that would allow cap and trade, by this spring.\The local government coalition has pushed for a 90 percent reduction without a cap and trade program, while other proposals have included lesser reductions and the trading program.\A group of utilities and power providers, including PRPA, said there are other ways to achieve mercury reductions.\""We feel there's more flexibility in the cap and trade program,"" said John Bleem, PRPA's division manager of customer and environmental services.\Bleem said PRPA will install monitoring devices this spring and plans to install controls in coming years to cut mercury emissions.\Advocates of the cap and trade system say it offers incentives for power plants to cut emissions, but opponents say it would allow polluters to skirt pollution reductions as long as they buy credits somewhere else.\Will Coyne, a program director for the Denver-based Environment Colorado, said power suppliers need to do more.\""They need to make a commitment to these significant reductions,"" Coyne said.\The process comes as the state health department said earlier this week fish in Horsetooth Reservoir and five other reservoirs in the state had elevated mercury levels and weren't safe to eat.\A meeting scheduled earlier this week was canceled because the two sides were in negotiations on a compromise rule. Sources close to the negotiations said Friday a settlement had been hammered out.\Lucinda Smith, a senior environmental planner with the city of Fort Collins, said the coalition initially formed because members were concerned about a cap and trade system that would have allowed interstate mercury credit trading.\""It's a neurotoxin, and it's not appropriate for trading,"" Smith said."
7,"There is just no more accurate way to put it: John Holdren, director of President Barack Obama's Office of Science and Technology Policy, is a nut. He makes up scary stories and tries to pass them off as science.\This was becoming apparent to The Gazette's editorial opinion department before all the talk of Holdren's writings about forced abortions and sterilizations to reduce American fertility. Before all that emerged in an Internet maelstrom this week, this department began looking into a report Holdren released just before the House of Representatives adopted a massive, mostly unread bill to impose cap-and-trade and a host of expensive regulations and mandates to save the planet from a quickly unraveling theory of anthropogenic global warming. Holdren presented the report as rationale for ""why remedial action is needed sooner rather than later?""\The Gazette contacted a Colorado scientist who's cited in Holdren's report. Robert Pielke, Jr., has spent his career researching catastrophic weather events in the hope of proving global warming is causing more of them, at greater intensity, leading to greater societal costs. Unfortunately for Pielke's career, he found precisely the opposite. He has proven in multiple reports, peer-reviewed and published in scientific journals, that catastrophic weather trends leave no room for global warming. Pielke, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado, told The Gazette that Holdren's report lied about his findings, citing his work to support a conclusion that global warming has increased catastrophic weather events.\The Gazette has tried to get a response from Holdren's office, which culminated in Holdren's director of communications explaining in an e-mail that he ""can't reach the person who has been closest to this."" That was on July 15, and as of this writing late Friday afternoon, we're still waiting.\It appears Holdren isn't one to let the facts interfere with a good story, like the one that says we'll all melt if the American citizens don't fund an effort to change the climate.\So it's little wonder those researching Holdren are finding that he has made a life out of publishing alarming chicken-little predictions that never come true. In the 1980s, as reported by WorldNetDaily, Holdren warned that human activity would cause environmental disasters that would kill billions of people by 2020. More recently he warned that sea levels could rise 13 feet by 2010. He'd better hope that water rises fast in the next 5 ? months.\Holdren, teaming with the authors of the alarmist and soundly discredited book ""The Population Bomb,"" co-authored a book titled ""Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment."" The book advocated an international police force to ensure enforcement of population controls.\Holdren warned us in 1973 that population in the United States could reach a whopping 280 million by 2040, which would be catastrophic. It's 2009, the U.S. is 304 million, and everyone is living at historically high standards, even during our country's second-worst financial crisis.\""Ecoscience"" argues that in some cases compulsory sterilization and forced abortions could help curb catastrophic population growth. Here's one of the multitudes of kooky passages in this alarmist book: ""It would even be possible to require pregnant single women to marry or have abortions, perhaps as an alternative to placement for adoption, depending on the society.""\Suddenly it is easy to believe Professor Pielke's claim that Holdren's report distorted scientific facts. It's easy to understand why Holdren's office has evaded our efforts at a response to Pielke's claims.\President Obama, please get a real scientist to advise you on science. Assign Holdren to scare children with his colorful, fictional tall tales."

Mexican President Felipe Calderón held his third bilateral meeting this year with U.S. President Barack Obama on Sunday, August 9th in Guadalajara to continue the intense dialogue between the two governments.
\
During the meeting, they exchanged points of view on the actions undertaken by each country to cope with the international economic crisis. They also discussed key aspects on the bilateral economic agenda. In particular, they discussed the issues of competitiveness, trade and public policies regarding the border.
\
The two leaders were confident that the development of border infrastructure will contribute to the shared objective of maintaining a safe, orderly border that will facilitate the legal exchange of goods and services, thereby contributing to the well-being of Mexican and American communities.
\
They agreed over the need to maintain institutional efforts to achieve the integral modernization of the border. Investment in border infrastructure will promote an improvement scheme that goes beyond trade and is designed to deal with issues such as health, the environment, dealing with natural disasters and academic, social and cultural exchange.
\
They hailed the progress achieved in the construction of the two new border bridges in Anzaldúas and San Luis Río Colorado, the start of another bridge in Rio Bravo-Donna and work on the first railway crossing point in over a hundred years located in Alternativa Poniente in Matamoros.
\
President Calderón told his American counterpart of the need to reach a solution that will provide a solution to the haulage contractors' conflict on the border, because of the impact this has on trade development, costs for consumers, regional competitiveness and the creation of jobs in both countries.
\
They discussed the actions carried out in the area of security. They agreed on the need to continue encouraging bilateral cooperation against the organized crime that operates on both sides of the border, on the basis of the principles of joint responsibility and respect for the legal framework of each country.
\
They hailed the importance of the High Level Group of Security and of their working groups, led by the Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretariat and the US Department of State and agreed that this organization would meet during the second half of this year.
\
As for the migratory issue, President Calderón hailed the political will shown by the U.S. President in encouraging the U.S. Congress to approve a reform in this area. The Mexican Head of State added that during this discussion, attention must be paid to the respect for migrants' and their families' human and labor rights, while U.S. society should acknowledge the enormous economic and cultural contribution of Mexican migrants to the United States.
\
They also reviewed the agenda on energy, environmental and climate change issues. They repeated their interest in taking advantage of the potential of the shared border to advance towards the development and transfer of clean energies and complement possible carbon markets between the two countries.
\
Within this framework, the two governments have discussed the creation of a possible framework of cooperation that could begin with a Carbon Compensation Program in the Mexican energy sector as well as other actions to offset deforestation, that could eventually lead both countries to a fully integrated system in North America regarding cap and trade.
\
They agreed over the importance of implementing the Green Fund proposal that will contribute to the International Community's efforts to leave a better environment to the upcoming generations by boosting countries' actual possibilities of having state-of-the-art technology that will support manufacturing programs to reduce the emission of greenhouse effect gases.
\
The two leaders also discussed the situation the region will face in the fall and winter regarding a possible new outbreak of the A/H1N1 influenza virus. They reviewed the measures adopted over the past few weeks that proved effecting in preventing the spread of this virus and other possible measures that should be implemented to deal with it again.
\
Lastly, the two leaders agreed to expand bilateral dialogue on the broad range of issues comprising the link between Mexico and the United States to maintain the Strategic Partnership established between the two administrations following their first working meeting in January 2009.

Dialogan Calderón y Obama
\
El Presidente de México, Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, sostuvo la tercera reunión bilateral en lo que va del año con el Presidente de Estados Unidos, Barack Obama, el domingo nueve de agosto en Guadalajara a fin de dar continuidad al intenso diálogo que han mantenido ambos Gobiernos.
\
Durante el encuentro, intercambiaron puntos de vista sobre las acciones emprendidas por cada país para hacer frente a la crisis económica internacional. En ese tenor, conversaron también sobre aspectos destacados de la agenda económica bilateral. En particular, abordaron los temas de competitividad, comercio y políticas públicas fronterizas.
\
Ambos Mandatarios expresaron su certeza de que el desarrollo de la infraestructura fronteriza coadyuva al objetivo compartido de mantener una frontera segura y ordenada, que facilite el intercambio legal de bienes y servicios, contribuyendo al bienestar de las comunidades mexicanas y estadounidenses.
\
Coincidieron en la necesidad de mantener los esfuerzos institucionales para lograr una modernización integral de la frontera. A partir de la inversión en infraestructura fronteriza, se impulsa un esquema de mejoramiento que va más allá de la esfera comercial, orientado a atender positivamente temas relacionados con la salud, el medio ambiente, la atención a desastres naturales, así como el intercambio académico, social y cultural.
\
Se congratularon por los avances observados en la construcción de dos nuevos puentes fronterizos en Anzaldúas y San Luis Río Colorado, el inicio de uno más en Río Bravo-Donna, así como el arranque de las obras del primer cruce ferroviario en más de 100 años ubicado en la Alternativa Poniente de Matamoros.
\
El Presidente Calderón planteó a su homólogo estadounidense la necesidad de llegar a una solución que dirima de manera definitiva el conflicto del autotransporte en la frontera, dado el impacto que éste tiene en el desarrollo comercial, los costos a consumidores, la competitividad regional y la generación de empleo en ambas naciones.
\
Dialogaron sobre las acciones desarrolladas en materia de seguridad. Coincidieron en la necesidad de seguir fomentando la cooperación bilateral en contra de la delincuencia organizada que opera en ambos lados de la frontera, con base en los principios de corresponsabilidad y respeto al marco jurídico de cada país.
\
Reconocieron la importancia del Grupo de Alto Nivel sobre Seguridad y de sus grupos de trabajo, que encabezan tanto la Cancillería mexicana como el Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos, y acordaron que esta instancia sesionará en el segundo semestre del presente año.
\
En lo que respecta al tema migratorio, el Presidente Calderón reconoció la voluntad política mostrada por el Mandatario estadounidense para motivar al Congreso de su país a aprobar una reforma en este rubro. El Jefe del Estado mexicano subrayó además que, en tanto se avanza en la discusión, debe prestarse atención al respeto de los derechos humanos y laborales de los migrantes y sus familias, así como al reconocimiento de la sociedad norteamericana a la importante contribución económica y cultural de los migrantes mexicanos a los Estados Unidos.
\
Revisaron además la agenda relacionada con temas energéticos, de medio ambiente y cambio climático. Reiteraron su interés en aprovechar el potencial de la frontera compartida para avanzar en el desarrollo y transferencia de energías limpias y complementar los posibles mercados de carbono entre ambas naciones.
\
En este marco, ambos Gobiernos han mantenido conversaciones sobre la elaboración de un posible marco de cooperación, que podría comenzar con un Programa de Compensación de Carbono en el sector energético mexicano, así como otras acciones para mitigar la deforestación, que eventualmente conducirían a ambos países a un sistema plenamente integrado en América del Norte, acerca del límite máximo y comercio de emisiones (Cap and trade).
\
Coincidieron en la importancia de instrumentar la propuesta del Fondo Verde, que coadyuve a los esfuerzos de la Comunidad Internacional encaminados a legar un mejor entorno a las próximas generaciones, fortaleciendo las posibilidades reales de las naciones para contar con tecnología de punta que apoye programas de transformación productiva para mitigar la emisión de gases con efecto invernadero.
\
Ambos Mandatarios conversaron también sobre la situación que enfrentará la región el próximo otoño e invierno, respecto de un posible nuevo brote del virus de influenza A/H1N1. Revisaron las medidas que se adoptaron en semanas pasadas y que fueron efectivas para evitar la propagación de este virus, así como de otras posibles medidas que debieran instrumentarse para hacerle frente de nueva cuenta.
\
Finalmente, ambos Mandatarios acordaron profundizar el diálogo bilateral en la amplia gama de temas que conforman la relación entre México y los Estados Unidos, en el ánimo de seguir abonando la Asociación Estratégica establecida entre las dos Administraciones, a partir de su primer encuentro de trabajo, en enero de 2009.

Matt Isenhower was sick of sitting in traffic. As the 34-year-old Navy veteran from Redmond, Washington, vanpooled 80 minutes to and from his job at Amazon in Seattle each day, he had plenty of time to lament the state Senate's refusal to invest in mass transit. Roughly 58 percent of Washington's carbon emissions come from the tailpipes of cars, trucks and other vehicles, and the Republicancontrolled Senate had also stymied Gov. Jay Inslee's attempts to forge a bipartisan agreement to limit greenhouse gasses.
\
Hoping to end the gridlock, Isenhower decided to run for state Senate. With his freshly shaven good looks, military background and Harvard MBA, Democrats thought Isenhower had a good shot at unseating Republican Andy Hill. And in this election year, that was a pretty big deal: If liberals could take just two seats in Washington's Senate, Inslee - a clean-energy champion and one of America's governors - would have a pro-environment majority in both chambers. There's no doubt what he could do with that kind of opportunity: Next year, Inslee hopes to release a sweeping plan that could make Washington the second state in the nation (after California) to slash carbon emissions across the economy by putting a price on them.
\
With the U.S. Congress growing less and less friendly to climate policy, environmental groups like the League of Conservation Voters and NextGen Climate are increasingly looking to progressive states like Washington to lead the way. 'The need for taking action on climate is stronger than ever,"" says Gregg Small, director of the Olympia-based advocacy group Climate Solutions. ""And (the Pacific Northwest) is one of the few places that has the desire to do it."" That's why environmentalists spent millions of dollars greeneôopyttÿiJrè&gtr^ogLilitiryebi©ws:liinate-friendly legislatures for both Inslee and Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber. Isenhower was one of the candidates they bankrolled.
\
But unprecedented spending by greens didn't save the U.S. Senate for Democrats, and it didn't turn Washington's red Senate blue. Isenhower lost. So did two other Washington Democrats who received outside money.
\
The results mean that any aggressive carbon-cutting plan put forth by Inslee will undoubtedly face more hurdles. But it doesn't mean Northwestern states will simply throw in the towel. Kerry McHugh, spokeswoman for the Washington Environmental Council, says Oregon and Washington may still join California in showing the nation that taking meaningful action on climate change need not cause economic ruin. ""The West Coast as a whole has been a place where interesting new policies have been incubated in the past,"" McHugh says, ""and I think that's going to be the case again.""
\
One reason for McHugh's optimism is the Pacific Coast Action Plan on Climate and Energy, a non-binding agreement signed last year by Washington, Oregon, California and British Columbia. Among other things, the plan requires Washington and Oregon to cut carbon, either through cap-and-trade (as California already does) or by taxing it (British Columbia's strategy). Inslee's forthcoming legislation, the details of which are still fuzzy, is Washington's first step toward upholding its commitment. Oregon may not be far behind.
\
But with oil-industry supporter Doug Ericksen still heading the Washington Senate Energy Committee, does Inslee's vision of a carbon market stand a chance? In the last session, Ericksen blocked legislation limiting oil trains, watered down a bill for a carbon emissions study, and hosted a retired professor who told the Senate that ""carbon dioxide cannot possibly cause global warming."" Inslee says he's willing to compromise with Ericksen and other Republicans, but he also has an ace up his sleeve: Earlier this year, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that the state is violating its Constitution by not adequately funding K-through-12 education. Lawmakers need to come up with billions of dollars for education, and the revenue that cap-and-trade or a carbon tax would generate might be an awfully appealing source.
\
There are other reasons for hope, too. The day after the election, Inslee reaffirmed his dedication to cutting carbon at an energy conference. He laid out ideas to streamline residential and commercial solar permits, encourage more electric vehicles, and expand the state's renewable energy program, ideas that Inslee spokeswoman Jaime Smith says all have a decent chance of passing the GOP Senate. Even more importantly, Inslee has the authority to implement a major cleanfuels standard without introducing new legislation.
\
There's also Oregon, a bright spot for climate activists in an otherwise dreary election. Before Nov. 4, Oregon already had a Democratic majority in both chambers, but it wasn't strong enough to pass Gov. Kitzhaber's proposal to reduce the carbon intensity of fuels by 10 percent over the next 10 years. Now, Democrats have increased their majority in both chambers of the Oregon Legislature, putting Kitzhaber in an enviable position to pass his clean-fuels bill and other climate legislation. Kitzhaber hasn't been as outspoken or proactive as Inslee on climate issues, but there have been hints he's moving toward carbon pricing - and there's no doubt he sees climate policy as part of his legacy.
\
National environmental groups like 350.org are keeping a close eye on Oregon and plan to keep pressuring both Northwest states to implement aggressive carbon-cutting policies. ""With climate deniers in control of Congress, we need to look for progress elsewhere,"" says Jamie Herrn, 350. org's communications director. ""The next five years are critical. There's no time to twiddle our thumbs."" ?

10,"From this perspective\One definition of an optimist is the fellow buried up to his neck in horse manure who gleefully exclaims 'Oh boy, there must be a pony around here somewhere!""\As a businessperson, you would have to be an unquenchable optimist to feel good about what is being shoveled around in Congress this fall. There's lots of odor de horse but no ponies in sight!\In particular, there are three issues businesspeople should be following: health-care reform, cap and trade and the deceptively named pro-unionization bill called the 'Employee Free Choice Act.' Individually, each issue is extremely expensive and damaging to the American economy. Taken together, they are an economic Waterloo.\In Stall No. 1 is health-care reform. Many Americans told Congress this summer not to touch their insurance and relationships with their doctors. Animating the discourse further is reform's projected $1.6 trillion price tag.\The current ideas to pay for this new government entitlement would fall heavily on the middle class and small business. According to the Cato Institute (www.cato.org) they include: taxing employer provided health insurance, eliminating Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), limiting the deductibility of medical expenses, raising alcohol and beverage taxes, and raising business taxes. These would amount to tax increases of about $700 billion over a decade. In Stall No. 2 is cap-and-trade legislation. The purpose of cap and trade is to discourage people from using fossil-based fuels by making it prohibitively expensive to do so while directing more money to alternative energy development.\Congress is considering an energy bill known as Waxman-Markey or the American Clean Energy and Security Act that is based on this concept. Touted by some as wonderful for the environment, analysis done by the Heritage Foundation projects profound economic disruption. By 2035 the bill would drive up the national debt by 29 percent, reduce aggregate gross domestic product by $9.6 trillion, destroy 1,105,000 jobs per year on average, drive up gasoline prices by an inflation-adjusted 74 percent and electricity costs would rise by an inflation-adjusted 90 percent. A typical family of four would see their direct energy costs increase by more than $1,500 annually. Many American businesses would be at a significant competitive disadvantage globally.\This bill barely passed in the U.S. House of Representatives this summer. It now moves to the Senate.\Finally, in Stall No. 3 is the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA). It received attention earlier this year because of the infamous card-check provision that would have taken the private vote away from workers during efforts to unionize their workplace.\After being roundly criticized, supporters decided that was a bad idea. Embarrassed but determined to make union organizing easy, proponents are now advocating provisions that would shorten their organizing window while at the same time muzzling employers from talking to their own employees about the downside of unionization. Talk to your own workers and pay a huge fine.\If you believe in the inherent good sense of the American people and the innovative resilience of America's market economy, you have to feel optimistic about our country's future...unless we keep burying ourselves.\David L. May is president and CEO of the Fort Collins Area Chamber of Commerce. Send e-mail to davidmay@fcchamber.org."

MONTANA NATIVE Corey Shott grew up in Missoula, came to D.C. to earn a bachelor's in political science at George Washington University and made politics her career: An internship with Montana Sen. Max Baucus, then campaign work for various Democratic candidates, then a couple of years as a ""junior lobbyist"" for a D.C. firm that helps trade associations (plumbing manufacturers and so on) deal with the government. ""I wanted to get back to meaningful work,"" she says, so in 2007, she hired on with the National Wildlife Federation.
\
Now 29, she works in the group's National Advocacy Center, a team of lobbyists, grass-roots organizers and communications staffers set up about a mile from the Capitol. She lobbies on climate and energy policy (lots of meetings with congressional staffers) and led the group's effort to create cap-and-trade legislation to limit carbon emissions. (The key bill was passed by the House of Representatives in 2009 but died in the Senate.) Recently, she's been working with NWF field staffers across the country to rally the public against Republican bills that would force the Environmental Protection Agency to ignore climate change. These days her work is ""more frustrating than usual,"" she says. ""You understand how important it is, but other people just don't care, or spread lies and misinformation.""
\
Montana - ""growing up there, waking up every morning and seeing the Rocky Mountains"" - inspires her and keeps her dedicated to her work. ""Going back to Missoula every year and seeing the changes in the fire season (caused by global warming), it feels bigger than just the game of politics, which is easy to fall into in D.C.""
\
She lives in a house on a tree-lined street just outside D.C. proper, a few miles from the Capitol, with her dog, an 80-pound ""lab and hound mutt with floppy ears."" She walks the dog in a neighborhood park, goes hiking in the city's Rock Creek Park and the nearest national forest (Shenandoah) and enjoys wandering the Chesapeake Bay shore. She's enrolled part-time in night school at Johns Hopkins University's D.C. campus, working on a master's in environmental sciences and policy. (NWF has four staffers in the night school in a program especially designed for people with day jobs.)
\
D.C, she says, is ""completely different from anything we have out West. People walk fast, talk fast"" and ""being in the heart of politics gets a little draining after a while. I try to have friends outside the environmental community,"" which she manages to do by playing rugby. ""It's nice to talk about something that isn't the environment.""
\
She feels a kinship with the other Westerners she meets in D.C, and hopes to move home after 10 years or so. ""I miss the mountains like crazy."" The topic often comes up in her D.C. conversations: ""Fm very proud to be from Montana. I definitely make sure to mention it."" RAY RING

12,"Sobering homeless facts\This letter concerns Barry Noreen's column of January 13. Homeward Pikes Peak does have: ""a commitment to end homeless,"" as noted in our mission statement. However, at a time when all other cities in the U.S. were adopting a HUD required ""Ten Year Plan to End Homelessness,"" HPP held out for, and had adopted, a ""Ten Year Blueprint to Serve Every Homeless Citizen of the Pikes Peak Region."" We wanted to show that our commitment of service to the homeless would never end, but that we understood some individuals would never agree to accept help in getting off the streets. It was in this spirit of service that the sobering bed plan was announced.\We have a terrible sociological and safety problem in our city right now with the homeless campgrounds, and it will take a community effort to solve it. \We need to reinstate the no camping ordinance and we need simultaneously to offer alternatives to those living in squalor along the creek beds. Some of these alternatives will be presented at the City Council meeting of January 25. We need to balance the welfare of the homeless campers with the welfare of the other 500,000 citizens of our area. \We are a conservative city, but one with a generous heart and a good spirit. If we set aside our differences we can and will work through this situation and the community spirit of Colorado Springs will be stronger for it.\Dr. Robert J. Holmes\Executive Director, Homeward Pikes Peak\Expansion means jobs, money\In response to Mr. Holdread's letter, (?Silence not so golden?, Dec. 27): I note that he seems to have gotten his first glimpse of who Governor Bill Ritter really is.\Congressman McInnis has been outspoken and candid from day one in his support of jobs, our troops and the expansion of Pinon Canyon. It appears that Governor Ritter and his political advisors have suddenly woken up and ""smelled the coffee? and Mr. Holdread doesn't like it.\Not only is the Pinon Canyon expansion about providing the best training possible for our soldiers who go into harm's way for all of us, but in the worst economic environment Colorado has endured since the 1930s, the Pinon Canyon expansion is about jobs - not only for the citizens of Pueblo and El Paso County but for southeastern Colorado.\What part of $140 million in economic incentives and a $9 million dollar annual operating budget does Mr. Holdread not like? \The part that includes increasing the total employment base by 2.5 percent in southeastern Colorado or the part that increases the Las Animas county business payroll by 5.75 percent? Those are real dollars that the DoD estimated would come to southeastern Colorado along with over 100 new jobs with the expansion. Unlike the Governor, Congressman McInnis gets it when it comes to jobs and the economy of Colorado.\A master of the obscene use of words like cannibalization, Mr. Holdread also is a fear monger. Some of us would appreciate it if Mr. Holdread could grasp the facts: agriculture grew in Colorado 22 percent from 1997 to 2007; of the 66.3 million acres of land in Colorado 30.7 or 1/2 of the land base in Colorado is used for agriculture; 86 percent of Colorado's water is used in agriculture; Colorado is number 8 among the 50 states for agricultural use of our land. \However, agriculture is currently only providing about 4.4 percent of the jobs in Colorado. Of course, no one I know, especially Congressman McInnis, is trying to kill agriculture in Colorado. \And for the sake of again trying to educate Mr. Holdread and his compatriots in southeastern Colorado, the Army has stated over and over that they will not ""seize? property to expand the training site. \Not that they can't do it if they see fit to do it - the U.S. Constitution gives them that power - they have continually said they will only buy land from willing sellers. But for fear of the angry mob Mr. Holdread and his gang has incited, there are willing sellers. Their right to sell their land is just as much a property right as the rights of those who choose not to do so.\Thanks to Governor Ritter and the state Legislature in 2008 and again in 2009, the ""unwelcome? sign they keep out for the Army is having serious repercussions for Colorado and the jobs the defense industry provides from Pueblo, to Aurora, to Boulder.\The list of economic and job losses to our state so far includes; a Brigade to Alaska, $150 million in military construction dollars-which would have been good, high paying construction jobs for Colorado - and the new Cyber Command-which would havemeant high tech jobs for Colorado, all because the governor and the legislature have made it clear that the military and defense industry are not welcome here. Sen. Hutchinson and Texas have made it clear to DoD and the Congress that they would welcome the training site and the troops, their families, and the $1.8 in billion economic benefits any time. \I feel sorry for Mr. Holdread and his angry friends. But, over 7 percent unemployment for Colorado is unacceptable to me and I know to Congressman McInnis.\Ed Jones\former state senator, Colorado Springs\Oath is meaningless\Since Senator Udall has confirmed that he is a socialist at heart in the health care bill, and Senator Bennet has proven that he is no more than a wet-behind-the-ears Democratic puppet, it looks like both of them will be voting to further strangle the American taxpayer with the Cap and Trade legislation. \Perhaps, as a product of the NEA, Michael Bennet learned his lessons well, with unions and political control trumping the need to teach students to think and to be independent. This has made Bennet the perfect candidate to be Harry Reid's Yes man, even to the demise of his own political career. \It's okay if he doesn't want to be a Senator, but he and Udall took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, and to represent the people of Colorado. \But, the oath is meaningless words, as Congress plows ahead toward the weakening of our economy with more and more tax and spend policies, regardless of the cries of protest. Cap and trade is just another vehicle for taxation without representation. As in the health care bill, extortion against the American citizen will again be committed by our Senators through cap and trade.\Ann Ransom\Colorado Springs"
13,"In downtown Colorado Springs, there are two public recycling bins.\And that's an improvement, said Mark Tremmell.\""As a conservative community, we should be the heart of sustainability. We should be conserving everything,"" said Tremmell, an architect who co-chairs a sustainability committee for the Downtown Partnership. He noted that, while recycling is mandatory in much of the nation, the few people here who recycle must pay extra to get cans, bottles and paper picked up at the curb.\It's an example of a contradiction that emerges in the Springs when discussing sustainability - broadly defined as reducing people's impact on the environment and natural resources through recycling, mass transit, cleaner energy, efficient buildings and locally grown food.\Last year, environmental group Sustain-Lane ranked Colorado Springs 43rd out of the 50 most populous U.S. cities for sustainability.\This month, Tremmell joined a dozen leaders from the public, private and nonprofit sectors for the first ""State of the Region"" panel discussion, part of the Southern Colorado Sustainability Conference.\But on the same day panelists were talking about environmental friendliness and listing their successes, voters were rejecting a proposed city tax hike - which could mean drastic cuts to bus service - and voting to end the Stormwater Enterprise fee, which funds drainage projects and works to restore waterways to a more natural state.\""We are not known as a green city, despite all the positive things we're trying to report,"" said Steve Saint, chairman of the Green Cities Coalition of the Pikes Peak Region, during the event. ""We have a legacy of decisions that have created sprawl and unsustainability in this region.""\There have been small successes and encouraging developments, said Eric Cefus, executive director of local environmental group the Catamount Institute, which organized the conference. He noted that the Pikes Peak Sustainable Business Network, a local consortium formed by the institute in January to share resources on being more environmentally friendly, has grown to 100 members.\But for many successes, there are discouraging downsides for environmental advocates.\Energy: Colorado Springs Utilities is on track to meet a state mandate of generating 10 percent of its power from renewables through wind, solar, biomass and hydroelectric power, but the operations are small compared with Utilities' overall energy system, which gets 70 percent of its power from coal.\""All those things come with a cost. If we do implement wind power or solar power, it may impact your rates,"" Mayor Lionel Rivera said at the conference.\But relying on coal could carry its cost. Cap-and-trade legislation in Congress would set a limit on carbon emission and cost coal-dependent communities millions, as they race to find new energy sources and buy credits from other utilities on the open market.\""The longer we procrastinate making a decision to start using more renewables and getting more efficient, the larger bills we're going to pay in the future,"" Cefus said.\Utilities CEO Jerry Forte, speaking at the conference, said the organization next year will update its Electric Integrated Resource Plan, a five-year energy road map that he hopes will be ""much more of a larger community conversation.""\Transportation: The much-maligned public bus system - Saint called it ""the lamest system that the city can afford"" - could be getting lamer. After the failure of a proposed tax hike in the Nov. 3 election, the cash-strapped city is considering cutting night and weekend service and some routes.\Environmental advocates said a lack of transit not only means more carbon emissions from cars on the roads, but it hurts Colorado Springs' reputation and ability to attract employers. In the national survey, Colorado Springs was ranked 47th out of 50 in metro transit ridership, and authors noted that 80 percent of commuters drive alone to work.\Recycling: Last summer, local trash haulers began offering single-stream recycling, meaning residents can mix their recyclables together in one bin for curbside pickup.\But it's still a service customers must pay extra for, and few do.\According to data released this month by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Colorado recycled 20 percent of residential waste in 2008, but in El Paso County, only 4.45 percent was recycled.\There is no facility here to sort and pack recyclables for shipping, so they are taken to Denver or Boulder, which adds to the cost of collecting them and leads to more trucks on the road.\""You should pay more for not recycling, not the other way around,"" said Tremmell, with the Downtown Partnership.\Trying to get public recycling bins has proven frustrating for Tremmell's committee, too. Since recycling service is costly, the only way they got two in place this year is because they are in front of businesses owned by environmental advocate and former City Councilman Richard Skorman, who bought the bins, and trash hauler Bestway Disposal is emptying them for free, Tremmell said.\Renewable energy industry: To the north and south of El Paso County, renewable energy companies are making major investments in Colorado. One company, Vestas Wind Systems, plans to build plants in Pueblo and north of Denver that would employ more than 1,500 total.\At the conference, Mike Kazmierski, president of the Colorado Springs Regional Economic Development Corp., said Vestas chose Pueblo because of its proximity to rail lines, and Colorado Springs was never in the running.\While renewable energy may be regarded as the industry of the future, he said it isn't yet a thriving industry.\Credit: R.

14,"HEALTH MATTERS \Legislation encourages people to get screenings \I was proud to co-sponsor one of the important health care bills the Governor signed recently (""Insurance for state kids is expanded,"" The Gazette, June 3). \Although it is the fourth-most-common type of cancer in Colorado, colon cancer has the second-highest mortality rate. Nearly half of those diagnosed with colon cancer could be saved if they had access to early screening. \Screening can be the difference between catching a polyp early, maybe before it is cancerous, and waiting too long. It is the difference between life and death. Unfortunately, colonoscopies and other types of screenings can be extremely pricey. Depending on the copayment, the average deductible for colorectal cancer screenings can range from $300 to $5,000, making testing cost-prohibitive, even for those with insurance. \But this year, we passed one of the most significant preventative health care bills in years. I co-sponsored House Bill 1410 which slashes the price of cancer screenings. The new law requires insurance companies to provide the most common colon cancer screenings with co-payments of no more than 10 percent of the total cost. \As a cancer survivor, I know firsthand how important early detection is. Focusing on prevention will help reduce our spiraling health care costs and keep Coloradans healthy. I encourage all people over age 50, and even younger if you are at-risk, to get tested, today. \Rep. Michael Merrifield \Colorado House District 18 Colorado Springs \SOME RULES COMMITTEE \Members took votes from millions of Democrats \Thirty members of the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic National Committee met in Washington, D.C. on May 31 with a promise to fairly resolve a crisis that threatened the very legitimacy of our democracy. Voters in Michigan and Florida, 2.4 million of them, went to the polls in good faith to vote for their presidential nominee. Their voices still have not been heard. \The decision for Michigan was a travesty. The will of more than 600,000 voters were given a 1/2 vote instead of a full vote. The committee went on record as saying the rules must be followed. What rules gave them the right to give four of Sen. Hillary Clinton's delegates to Sen. Barack Obama? \Where is the rule that says uncommitted delegates go to Obama? Uncommitted delegates should go to the convention uncommitted and make their decision there. Obama accepted this so-called compromise. How can a candidate whose message is unity and ""count every voice"" agree to support a decision that strips Clinton of delegates she rightfully earned? \The day that was supposed to unite the party did just the opposite. \Brenda Krause \Colorado Springs \INTO THE WILD \Op-eds took opposite views of the same local area \What a way to start a weekend: two pompous swells (David Lien, Richard Celeste) on the same page, offering their opinions on what to do with the same area (""Roosevelt would back local wilderness area;"" ""Project would spotlight southern Colorado arts,"" Other Voices, May 31). One compared himself to President Teddy Roosevelt and the other encouraged us to support ""Rags Over the River"" as art. One urged keeping out all but the elites and the other wants to attract as many as possible to see his definition of art. \Joe Pieper \Colorado Springs \MANAGING THE MARKET \Windfall profits tax would allow feds to be in control \Syndicated columnist John Stossel argued that high oil prices and profits are good for America because the free market incentives will lead to more exploration, development of oil substitutes and increased efficiency ("" 'Windfall' profits proposals tax knowledge of economics,"" Opinion, May 31). Increased taxes can also have the same effect. \If oil companies can no longer make huge profits either through increased prices for their product (effect of the increased tax burden) or through greater efficiencies which allow prices and therefore profits to remain the same, they will seek out new alternatives where there is greater profit potential. Demand affects price and when prices get too high there is more incentive to find substitutes. \Do we want to provide incentives for oil companies and investors to continue our reliance on oil or finding alternative renewable sources? Alternative sources which are less damaging to our environment, sources which might be discovered through our colleges and universities funded by the windfall-profit taxes. \Our government can guide the free market so it benefits our nation. Or our government can take a laissez-faire approach and let the market control what happens, which may not always be in our nation's interests. President Franklin Roosevelt warned us in his first inaugural address in reference to profit seekers in the marketplace, ""They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish."" \Tim Durbin \Fountain \TEACHER PAY \Educators on sliding back with current pay scale \This is regarding The Gazette's May 31 report, ""Teachers will see roughly 1 % pay hike."" The story stated, ""teachers also see pay increases each year they remain in the district and for training and education."" \This is misleading. In District 11 and most other districts, teachers do not automatically get a pay increase each year they remain in the district. The ""step"" raises stop when they reach the end of their pay column. With a masters degree this happens after 16 years. \Those at the end of their pay column get the ""cost of living"" raise only. \Yes, a teacher can get an additional raise for completing 16 credit hours of training or coursework, but this takes a while to do. Once completed, the teacher arrives at the bottom of the next pay column getting that 1 percent ""cost of living"" raise again. \Teachers who are in this for the long haul find that their salaries do not keep pace with inflation. There are great retirement benefits for sure, but as far as take-home pay to support a family right now, teachers in their prime earning years are almost flat-lining while the cost of living goes up. \Ben Fromuth \Colorado Springs \BAD IDEA \Cap-and-trade proposal wouldn't change emissions \Cartoonist Dik Browne, in his ""Hagar the Horrible"" comic, made a good illustration of the cap-and-trade concept. Hagar ate the allotted two pieces (the cap) of chocolate cake. His wife Helga ate only one. Hagar then bartered (the trade) to buy Helga's unused allotment. \Substitute a ton of carbon emissions for a piece of chocolate cake and two tons as the allotment. If the creator of two tons of carbon emissions cannot stop there, he can purchase the right to another ton of carbon emissions from a lesser emitter. There is no net decrease in carbon emissions and an increase in cost to the producer. \If there is no seller of an allotment of carbon emission, there is no need to worry. The right to increased emissions may be purchased from the government. This becomes both a tax and an increase in carbon emissions. I see this as lose-lose. \Cap-and-trade is really a bad idea. \Tom Hebda \Colorado Springs"

\
This 60-second animation was the first salvo fired by the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund in its battle against New Mexico Congressman Steve Pearce and five other Republican lawmakers, over their support for carbon-intensive fossil fuel industries. Typical of the Action Fund's aggressive strategy, the ad pulls no punches. And Pearce is still in the Fund's sights: It is now running ""Flip of the coin"" ads portraying Pearce and fellow Republican Rep. Heather Wilson as anti-environment big-oil supporters - heads and tails of the same bad penny. Both are vying for the chance to run against Democrat Tom Udall for the Senate seat being vacated by Republican Pete Domenici this fall.
\
""We've found over the past seven years that science, law and makers. So we're focusing on members of committees that matter,"" says Fund director Rodger Schlickeisen, who hopes to tip the balance in Congress toward ""a significant piece of legislation that redirects our energy policy away from fossil fuels.""
\
The Fund used similar tactics two years ago, when it led an attack against the ""unbeatable"" seven-term California Congressman Richard Pombo, pro-energy chair of the House Resources Committee, who was notorious for wanting to privatize national parks, drill the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and gut the Endangered Species Act. Despite an eleventh-hour injection of more than a million dollars into the campaign and appearances on his behalf by Vice President Cheney and President Bush, Pombo lost by more than 13,000 votes to windenergy consultant Jerry McNerney.
\
Environmentalists had a new ally in Congress - and the Action Fund had won its first David-andGoliath victory.
\
The Fund's campaigns are characterized by an early entry into the races, a small core staff, and engagement on all fronts: research and polling to uncover candidate weaknesses; voter targeting through door-to-door canvassing, phone calls and mail; grassroots organizing with members; and TV, radio and Internet ads. Targeting vulnerable members of key environmental committees is ""the unique element"" of the Fund's strategy, says Bob Duffy, author of The Green Agenda in American Politics: New Strategies for the 21st Century.
\
In the past, says Duffy, the Action Fund and other enviro groups diluted their potency by not working together. But since 2006, the Action Fund - the political arm of the 60-year-old nonprofit Defenders of Wildlife - has been collaborating with the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, the Clean Water Action Fund and Environment America in integrated, sophisticated campaigns that increased the groups' collective clout. In the Pombo campaign, for example, the Fund's field director and four staffers worked with the other conservation groups to recruit 300 volunteers, who ran a phone bank and knocked on 75,000 doors to ensure voter participation.
\
Not everyone is enthusiastic about the Fund's tactics. Starting the campaign early - in the case of Pearce and Wilson, during the primary race - is a questionable strategy, says Lonna Atkeson, a political science professor at the University of New Mexico. ""They're playing to an electorate that isn't paying attention,"" she says.
\
But Schlickeisen believes that getting out ""before the media clutter and clatter, when people are still listening"" is the best way to ""define the candidates.""
\
Schlickeisen views the campaign ""through two lenses: We're always concerned about the committees, and we know that no matter how good the legislation is in the House, the Senate can't get past the 60-vote filibuster. We have to be able to pass that threshold.""
\
Electing pro-conservation folks to Congress could swing the vote toward cap-and-trade legislation and renewable energy initiatives, agrees Tony Massaro, political director for the League of Conservation Voters. The League was able to help defeat nine of 13 legislators with abysmal conservation records in 2006, he notes, ""and for the first time in 32 years, Congress passed new fuel-economy standards.""
\
This election cycle, the Fund and its allies are also taking aim at Colorado's Bob Schaffer, the likely Republican candidate against Democrat Mark Udall for the Senate seat now held by Wayne Allard, R; and first-term New Hampshire Republican Sen. John Sununu, who will run against former Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen for the Senate.
\
The Fund spent about $2.5 million in the 2006 election cycle, $1.5 million on the Pombo race alone. Schlickeisen predicts the Fund will receive about $3 million this year, from 30,000 individual donors. Because it accepts no funding from corporations or labor organizations, the Fund is able to use its money to directly oppose and support ballot initiatives. (In 2006, five of six takings initiatives were defeated in the West, partly because of the Fund's efforts.)
\
""There are 435 congressional races every two years, and 33 Senate races,"" says Schlickeisen. ""We don't lower our head and run at the wall. We choose a handful of key races we think we can win.""

It's hard to put a finger on what drives the wild popularity of Deadliest Catch, the Discovery Channel's series about crab fishing in the Bering Sea. Pulling load after load of crustaceans off the bottom of the ocean seems like pretty thin stuff for a runaway entertainment phenomenon. Yet the show has somehow won over more than 4 million viewers and garnered five seasons of red-hot ratings.
\
Granted, the weekly drama of the Red Bull-guzzling, cigarette-huffing, bleepitybleeping captains doing battle with 13 million pounds of king crab does give the show a certain NASCAR- worthy je ne sais quoi. But if there's a single secret ingrethent behind the show's success, it is the drama of the multimillion-dollar fishing derby - starring the likes of Phil Harris, spitting blood and tearing his hair out as his boat gradually falls apart around him, and Johnathan Hillstrand, like a Hells Angel behind the wheel of the Time Bandit - to catch as many crabs as possible before the government drops the checkered flag on the season. Though it's not much discussed on the show, the scramble for crab is just a videogenic symptom of a larger - and potentially catastrophic - problem in fishing: Too many boats chasing too few fish.
\
""You could've had 25 boats easily catching the whole quota,"" says Edward Poulsen, a second-generation Bering Sea crab fisherman. ""But there were 300 boats.""
\
That free-for-all brought a host of problems, from environmental damage caused by carpet-bombing the ocean floor with crab pots, to bankruptcies and a chilling roster of lost fishermen and boats that sank after they ventured out into fierce storms so they wouldn't get left behind in the race. For years, crab fishing in the Bering Sea was the deadliest job in the country - more likely to kill you than going on foot patrol in Iraq.
\
But even as the Deadliest Catch rocketed to popularity, the hard lessons of two decades of racing for fish were finally sinking in for fishermen in the Bering Sea, and they were voluntarily agreeing to end the race. You'd never know it from watching the show, but only one season after it hit TV screens, crab fishermen in Alaska began fishing under a new system that permanently divided up the annual catch between all the boats in the fishery.
\
""The whole dynamic of the fishery has changed,"" says Kale Garcia, another longtime crab fisherman, who owns a boat called the Aquila.
\
In the Bering Sea today, the race for crab is now over. But the fishery there is just one ripple in the tide of a revolution that has swept the fishing world over the past 20 years. Today, fisheries for everything from fish-stick staples like whiting and pollock to high-end delicacies like halibut and sablefish operate under ""catch share"" programs. Many more, including a major groundfish fishery on the West Coast and one in New England, are now following suit. Jane Lubchenco, the marine biologist who now heads the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (which manages the nation's fisheries) has launched a concerted effort to institute catch-share programs in as many U.S. fisheries as possible.
\
Yet even as the tide rises for catch shares, the fleet and the crews in the Bering Sea are still contending with farreaching aftereffects - something not seen on TV, and not much discussed by catch-share boosters.
\
MORE THAN ANYOTHER REALM of modern human endeavor, commercial fishing has been fired with a belief in the limitlessness of the planet's natural bounty. With that conviction has come a sort of jackpot mentality, the notion that vast, fishy riches lie beneath the ocean's surface, waiting for any bold fisherman with a good boat and a little luck. Yet at the same time, no pursuit has so dramatically shown the catastrophic downside of such magical thinking.
\
In 1976, Congress asserted American control over the waters off the U.S. coastline, declaring a 200-mile-wide band of ocean as an Exclusive Economic Zone, and eventually kicking out foreign vessels. Suddenly, any American with a boat could get a piece of the action, and Yankee ingenuity ran wild. Then, in 1983, king crab populations in Alaska collapsed. With nothing to catch, the huge fleet of crab boats foundered.
\
""They just drove a lot of the boats to the dock, dropped the keys at the harbormaster's office, and took the next plane to Seattle,"" says Rick Lauber, who was the chairman of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council from 1991 until 2001. The banks found themselves with dozens of repossessed boats on their hands. ""It was kind of a standing joke,"" Lauber says, ""that Seattle First National Bank"" - which had made more boat loans than any other bank at the time - ""had a deal: When you opened a new account, they gave you your choice of a free toaster, or a crab boat.""
\
Crab populations tend to follow a boom-and-bust dynamic, and crab fishermen ride the wave right along with them. In the aftermath of the crash, a few crabbers hung on, turned their attention to the snow crab fishery, and slowly crawled their way back to solvency. They got a boost from another, unrelated bust - this one in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore oil industry - that flooded the market with cheap offshore supply vessels, the doanything pickup trucks of the boat world.
\
""There was afire-sale discount going on in the Gulf of Mexico,"" says Erik Oison, a vice president with Northwest Farm Credit Services. ""If you were an opportunistic fishermen, you could pick up an oil supply boat for 20 cents on the dollar, add a pot hauler and some pumps, and you were ready to go.""
\
The ensuing rebound was another textbook example of the synergistically destructive dynamics of an ""open-access"" fishery. Would-be fishermen piled boats upon boats onto the water, all trying to wrangle their piece of the action, and each one Rambo'd up his vessel to make it as efficient a crab-catching machine as possible.
\
For the crab, at least, the situation wasn't as bad as it might have been. Even before the explosion of boats began, fisheries managers had moved to protect crab populations by implementing an overall limit on the number that could be caught without threatening the long-term sustainability of the population. Such quotas are now most commonly known as a Total Allowable Catch, or TAG.
\
But for the fishermen, the situation was alot less rosy. ""If you just set the TAC and let anybody go fish, and when the (limit) is hit you end the season, that creates an incentive to go and race to catch as much as you can before the season is shut down,"" says Christopher Costello, a professor of environmental and resource economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ""People overinvest in things like big boats, and then no one's making any money - even if the stock is being fished at (an ecologically) sustainable level.""
\
With too many boats chasing too few crab, fishermen started going broke. They also - literally - started going under. In the scramble to catch as much of the quota as possible, boats frequently sailed into fierce Bering Sea storms, and some never returned. Between 1989 and 2005, 10 crab boats sank in the Sea, taking 51 men with them. Another 34 men were lost overboard or killed.
\
""They were going down left and right,"" says Arni Thomson, the head of the Alaska Crab Coalition.
\
THE KEY TO de-Rambofying the fishery proved to be a system of catch shares - essentially, a cap-and-trade system similar to the kind that has come into vogue for fighting things like acid rain and climate change. In the 1970s, Iceland became the first nation to put them into practice, followed by New Zealand.
\
Under a Total Allowable Catch, each fisherman hustled to catch as much of the pie as he could. With catch shares, by contrast, the pie was sliced up, and each crab boat owner got his own permanent piece, frequently referred to as an individual fishing quota, or IFQ.
\
In most catch-share programs, one boat owner can sell or lease his shares to another, just as polluters can sell the right to pollute to one another under cap and trade systems. Because there are too many boats relative to fish stocks, many fishermen will end up with catch shares that are too small to be profitable over the long term. But they can sell or lease those shares to other fishermen, who can, in turn, ""stack"" them onto their own boats.
\
In the United States, the first two catch-share programs were put in place during the 1980s, on the East Coast. The third U.S. program, approved in 1990, was for halibut and sablefish in the Gulf of Alaska, where so many boats were chasing so few fish that the halibut season had been reduced to just three 24-hour derbies per year. That program went into effect in 1995, and over the next several years, several other Alaskan and one West Coast fishery began operating under catch-share systems, too.
\
But crab fishermen have always been a breed apart. Many harbored an inher- ent skepticism of theoretical notions about running the fishery; to them, this one must have smelled like it had been cooked up by some guy in an Adidas track suit at a Scandinavian think tank. ""Crabbers are unique,"" says Linda Kozak, a fisheries consultant based in Kodiak, Alaska. ""It takes a special temperament to go out there and battle the elements. Many of them are very stubborn. And a lot of them are extremely paranoid of the political process."" (They are also notoriously reticent, and none of the captains who regularly appear on Deadliest Catch responded to repeated attempts to contact them for this story.)
\
Catch shares cut hard against long tradition, where every season was a roll of the dice and you always ran the risk of crashing and burning - but you might also hit the jackpot. ""At the beginning of the season, there was so much energy in the air that your hair would just stand on end,"" says Kale Garcia. ""And then when you're out on the (fishing) grounds, you're like, 'This is a big ocean, and this crab pot's only seven feet across,' and the next thing you know, you're puking out the window from stress.""
\
But in 1999, crab populations crashed again. To protect the surviving crab, fisheries managers progressively reduced the length of each subsequent season. By 2004, the snow crab season lasted for five days. The king crab season lasted for just three days, giving fishermen just 72 hours to make half their annual income. ""If you broke a (drive) shaft, or had a breakdown or an injury,"" says Garcia, ""it could cost you your season.""
\
Crab fishermen grudgingly began yielding to the reality that anything even if it seemed like a strange marriage of socialist central planning and neoliberal economics - was better than the way the fishery had historically been run. Over the next four years, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, which oversees the Alaska fisheries, intensely debated a complex plan to ""rationalize"" the fishery by introducing catch shares.
\
The rationalization plan first cut 25 boats - about 10 percent - out of the fleet entirely with a $97 million federal buyout. (The remaining boats are now paying back that money through a tax on their landings.) Then the plan divided individual fishing quotas up among the remaining 250-odd boats.
\
In 2005 - just six months after Deadliest Catch premiered - Bering Sea crab fishermen finally began fishing under the catch-share program. In the four years since, red king crab seasons have lasted three months, on average, while the snow crab season has lasted more than seven months. When the IFQ system began, there were 251 boats fishing for red king crab, and 164 fishing for snow crab. Within a year, as boat owners began tying their boats up and leasing their quota shares to other owners, that number had fallen to 89 and 80 boats, respectively.
\
In contrast to the dice roll of the openaccess fishery, under the quota system fishermen know how much crab they'll get before the boat ever leaves the dock. For the banks, it has helped provide stability to what had essentially been a sea-going demolition derby. ""You know that a fisherman is going to be allocated ? percent of the crab. You can translate that into dollars, and you can get a pretty good idea of what their revenue will be,"" says Erik Oison, the Farm Credit banker. ""That is a huge change. It's the difference between, 'Grab a case of Red Bull, pray for good weather, and buckle up,' and, 'Now we have a business plan.' ""
\
Average catches per boat have gone up considerably. Mark Fina, an economist with the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, found that the average king crab harvested per vessel in 2007 was about 4.6 times the amount harvested in 2004, the last year of the openaccess fishery.
\
And while the track record is short, there have been no sinkings or major accidents on crab boats since the IFQ program went into place. ""The difference is the stress level when you're out there,"" says Gretar Gudmundsson, who owns a crab boat called the Notorious. ""If you don't catch it all that trip, you go in and deliver, because you can go out and get it next time.""
\
CATCH-SHARE PROGRAMS like the one for Bering Sea crab are becoming increasingly common amid growing concern over the general state of the world's fisheries. In 2006, a research team led by Boris Worm, a marine biologist at Dalhousie University in Canada, found that about 27 percent of the world's fisheries have collapsed. More ominously, the team's paper, which was published in Science, suggested that every fishery in the world might collapse by 2048.
\
Then, last year, Costello, the scientist, and several of his colleagues published an analysis of catch shares that received wide attention. They found that, of 121 fisheries managed using IFQs - which are also referred to as Individual Transferable Quotas, or ITQs - ""the fraction of ITQ- managed fisheries that were collapsed was about half that of nonITQ fisheries."" The paper suggested that implementing a catch-share program can stop and actually reverse the decline of fish populations.
\
Some observers contend that, in fact, the bulk of the conservation benefit may actually come from having a good, scientifically determined TAC, rather than the catch shares themselves. ""A lot of people are asking that now,"" says Costello. ""I don't know of anybody who's done a careful job teasing out what benefit you get from just having a TAC.""
\
Still, he says, the kinds of individual quotas that come with a catch-share program help conservation: ""When you implement an ITQ, there is better adherence to the TAC. If you're responsible for every fish you catch, then people don't bust through the TAC as often."" And, he adds, ""When you have an ITQ, you fish more slowly. It's not like the (old) threeday season, where you're out dragging every inch of habitat because you have to catch as much as you can, as quickly as you can.""
\
Several environmental groups have taken up Costello's study as evidence of the need to use catch-share programs more widely. Other fishery- manage ment regimes have tended to trigger a ""neverending cat-and-mouse game,"" says David Festa, the vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund's West Coast operations. Limiting the length of the season, for instance, only spurred boat owners to turn their vessels into even better fishcatching machines.
\
""The key,"" he says, ""is moving to a system where you give the fishermen direct accountability for the fish they catch."" And, Festa adds, once fishermen are given a share in the resource - and therefore have a stake in it - they will fish in ways that allow fish populations to increase. ""The incentive is to make sure you're growing the overall health of the stock, to increase your slice of the pie,"" he says.
\
Other environmental groups are more critical. Phil Kline is the ocean campaigns manager for Greenpeace, which has joined with several other groups to form the Marine Fish Conservation Network. Kline says that it's important that catchshare programs be structured to prevent individual quota owners from amassing too large a percentage of the total available shares; have tough conservation requirements; be granted as a revocable privilege rather than an absolute right to catch fish; and provide new fishermen the opportunity to cast their hand in the fishery.
\
Nonetheless, Kline says, the Network has given qualified support to the catchshare concept - a position that stands in marked contrast to an earlier stance of outright opposition. ""This is a position that Greenpeace, as well as the broader environmental community, has evolved to over the past 15 years,"" Kline says. ""It was not realistic to maintain a position of just no nothing on any of this.""
\
There now seems, in fact, to be a certain inevitability to the rising tide of catch shares. Last fall, the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which oversees fisheries regulations for Washington, Oregon and California, approved an IFQ program for the trawl fleet there. And this June, the New England Fishery Management Council approved a catch-share program for the New England groundfish fleet. The same month, Lubchenco, the new head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, created an agency task force to implement catch shares as broadly as possible.
\
FOR ALL THE GOOD NEWS that comes with catch shares, there is a downside. They often bring heavy costs to fishing crewmen. And just as any acknowledgment of the end of the race for fish is taboo on Deadliest Catch, the social cost of catch shares has essentially been relegated to footnotes in the reams of slick literature put out by pro-IFQ environmental groups.
\
A recent study by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council found that, since the crab catch-share system was implemented, and the number of boats on the water subsequently reduced, average revenues per boat have almost quadrupled. But the deckhands on those same boats have only slightly more than doubled their pay, on average. That's largely because when boat owners lease quota from other boats to stack onto theirs, they pay heavy lease fees, much of which they pass on to the crew.
\
For at least some crewmen, that casts into sharp relief the divide between how boat owners and their crew have fared under rationalization. Many boat owners were struggling before rationalization. ""Some of these guys were desperate to get a catch-share program so they could sell out,"" says Linda Kozak, the Kodiak-based consultant. ""We call it a graceful exit.""
\
With rationalization, those owners suddenly became armchair fishermen. ""A lot of the guys just park their boat and lease their quota out,"" says Steve Branson, a Kodiak-based crewman. ""They just go to the mailbox and pick up their royalty check.""
\
In a hard-won concession, those captains who didn't own their own vessels received 3 percent of the total catch shares. But the deckhands received nothing. Traditionally, they could buy into a boat by increments, becoming a part owner as they proved their mettle. Now, though, they have to purchase catch shares before they can even think about fishing on their own.
\
There's also some evidence of a new emphasis on running boats as cheaply as possible. With a fixed catch, the main way to increase your margin is to drive down operating costs. ""It used to be about how much you could catch,"" one former crewman told the authors of another recent North Pacific Fishery Management Council report. ""Now it's about how cheap you can catch it.""
\
That report also noted a growing concern among crewmen that boat owners are now more likely to hire deckhands, including undocumented immigrants, on a wage basis, rather than dealing them in on a share of the boat's earnings, as has traditionally been done.
\
But the biggest impact has been shouldered by crewmen who have lost their jobs on boats that no longer fish. For each boat that has left the fishery, five to six crew jobs went with it. Mark Fina, the fishery council economist, has estimated that as many as 975 crewmen - more than half the total who worked in the fishery - have lost their crabbing jobs since rationalization.
\
And for those crew members, the exit from the business may not be that graceful. Unlike laid-off auto workers, they receive no severance package. Though the evidence is mostly anecdotal, it seems fairly clear that crewmen who lost their jobs on Alaska-based boats from ports like Kodiak have had to leave for work elsewhere. ""Some guy, now, instead of being a fisherman in Alaska like he always dreamed of,"" says Rick Lauber, ""is making tires in a factory in Dayton.""
\
The asymmetrical impacts of the boat consolidation rankle many former crewmen. ""Sure, there were too many boats. But whose fault is that?"" says Corey Eisenbarth, another deckhand. ""The people that built the boats and over- exploited the fishery are the same guys who got all the money.""
\
But many boat owners argue that they should, by rights, receive the bulk of the catch shares and the money that comes with them. Unlike deckhands, they've made large capital investments in the business. And, they point out, rationalization simply hastened what was an inevitable fate for the people who are now jobless. ""That was going to happen regardless, because we didn't have a sustainable fleet size,"" says Edward Poulsen.
\
That may be the unavoidable bottom line in most fisheries, whether they're run under catch shares or not. Julie Wormser is Environmental Defense's New England Oceans Program director. For the past several years, she's been closely involved in the creation of the new IFQ plan for the groundfish fishery in New England, a region famously battered by years of mismanagement and intense competition for dwindling stocks offish. Finding equitable solutions for out-of-work crewmen is ""the touchiest question,"" she concedes. ""It's area! cost.""
\
But she argues that a traditional derby-style fishery - like the one that viewers tune in every week to supposedly see on Deadliest Catch - is pretty brutal, too. ""Everybody's fishing to put everybody else out of business,"" she says. ""And the alternatives aren't catch shares versus some dreamy universe where everybody has a good job. It's catch shares versus a continued downward spiral.""

17,"Democratic dissension, Republican opposition and growing public skepticism may derail Congress' potentially economy-crippling carbon cap-and-trade bill, perhaps saving Americans billions of dollars.\The bill's author, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., is opposed by centrist Democrats, who fear the Draconian regulations would severely harm their constituents. Congress members representing the steel industry and coal and nuclear power generators oppose the 648-page American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, authored by Waxman and Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass.\Meanwhile, Republicans cite studies showing the bill would increase a typical family's energy prices at least $3,100 a year, and over 20 years result in 7 million lost jobs and $7 trillion in reduced economic output.\President Barack Obama invited 36 House Democrats to the White House last week to urge passage of the legislation that would sell permits to companies, gradually diminishing allowable greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the prodding, negotiations remained stalled.\Growing skepticism over the approach, and even the need to fight global warming by curbing greenhouse gas emissions, isn't limited to Capitol Hill. An artificial market in government-mandated carbon credits would be ""monstrously stupid to do right now,"" Berkshire Hathaway Inc. CEO Charlie Munger told CNBC, adding that the move is ""almost demented"" considering other nations' intention to continue industrial development, emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases.\Public sentiment is at a new low, too, says pollster Zogby International. Only 30 percent of Americans support cap-and-trade, and 57 percent oppose it. A Pew Research poll of voter priorities ranked global warming dead last behind the economy and 18 other areas.\The Gallup Poll recently found a record 41 percent surveyed believe global warming claims are exaggerated, and at most 2 percent even cite the environment as their biggest concern.\In addition, a recent study by the National Center for Climate Research shows that if fully implemented, the Waxman-Markey bill would produce global temperature ""savings"" of only 0.05 degree centigrade over 50 years. Even James Hansen, the NASA scientist and perhaps most ardent proponent of manmade global warming as a threat, urges the bill's defeat, saying it would be ineffective in reducing greenhouse gases.\Considering its questionable assumptions, economic costs and hardships, this bill promises a paltry return on investment. One might say it's ""almost demented."""
18,"Early on election night, as a drizzly dusk settled over Seattle, I made my way to the Arctic Club, a hotel decorated with explorers' maps and a fake polar bear - a fitting place to await the results on Washington's carbon tax initiative. Upstairs, in a dimly lit ballroom, community organizers and other supporters of the ballot measure had already gathered. Recent polls suggested a close call on the measure, officially called Initiative 1631, a local, political effort to address the global challenge of climate change.\This was the state's second attempt to tax carbon emissions, and in the months leading up to the vote, an unusually wide swath of Washington society had turned out in support. A coalition of environmental groups, labor unions, racial and economic justice advocates, health workers and leaders from nearly two dozen tribal nations had designed the tax proposal, and their supporters, in a mix of work-wear, fleece and the occasional suit, filled the airless room. If people were nervous, it didn't show. A few campaigners sat hunched over computers in the back corner, but mostly, it seemed, people were there to socialize. The line for the bar stretched the length of the room, and a bank of television screens on the far wall drew barely a glance as the evening progressed.\At 8:15 p.m., the buzz of conversation spiked, becoming a roar. ""We did it,"" a young woman standing next to me said. I checked the televisions: A few counties were leaning toward approving the measure. The room began to perk up. Daisy-chains of young supporters, linked arm-in-arm, wound through the crowd, their shirts proclaiming ""Yes on 1631."" ""This energy!"" a man standing nearby exclaimed, surveying the clusters of people shouting enthusiastically about the results. ""People who weren't sure if they were going to win - that's the best.""\The celebrations lasted a few minutes. Then a strange hush swept the room, rippling outward from the televisions. People pulled out their phones to refresh elections pages. A second wave of results had come in, and the tide had turned. By 9 p.m., Initiative 1631 was dead.\A few speakers got up to laud the hard work of campaign staff, and the room, which hadn't quite lost its party feel, echoed with the murmur of people dissecting a loss that hadn't sunk in. Then the speeches ended, and people began to leave, making their way to the city's gloomier bars or pedaling home in the dark. As the room emptied, I stood there refreshing my own phone, wondering what had just happened, and what it might mean.\THE FAILURE OF WASHINGTON'S CARBON TAX proved a dim coda to the state's long fight to control rising temperatures and reverse their effects on its most vulnerable communities. Its demise raised big questions about humanity's ability to address climate change. Yet its failure had seemed improbable. After all, in the months leading up to the vote, climate change made its mark on much of Washington life. Over the summer, a ragged line of wildfires scorched the Northwest, curling from British Columbia through eastern Washington and down to Oregon. Wheat fields and forests burned and towns throughout the region were choked with wildfire smoke. In Seattle, people halted their daily runs and commuters wore masks to work, as an orange murk hid the hills of the suburbs and clung to the Space Needle. In August, a mother orca lost her calf, then carried its body on her nose for 17 days, a painful reminder of species loss and habitat degradation. In the fall, many of the state's largest salmon and steelhead fisheries closed, from the Yakima to the Columbia River, thanks to warming rivers and oceans. Just a few weeks after the election, the National Climate Assessment confirmed that all that was likely just an ominous portent of things to come: Climate change threatens the region's infrastructure with landslides, rising seas and aberrant weather, while its most vulnerable communities face deteriorating air and water quality.\Given these reminders, now would have seemed a prime time for Initiative 1631. For years, economists have said that a carbon tax - which essentially builds an economic incentive to curtail emissions of carbon dioxide - is one of the most efficient ways to combat climate change. Initiative 1631 proposed to do this by putting a fee ($15 per metric ton) on carbon emissions from the largest polluters, then slowly increasing that fee, with the revenue going toward programs that reduce greenhouse gases and pollution and their effects. Washington voters, in other words, were given a specific ac- tion to undertake while they lived out the specific consequences of climate change.\It made sense here, in a green-leaning state where calls to climate action ring louder than in, say, coal-dependent Wyoming. Throughout the Intermountain West, the oil and gas industry provides a lot of jobs and wields a lot of influence, and a significant number of voters support mining and fossil fuel extraction. But in the Northwest, that's not the case. In Washington, hydroelectric dams, not fossil fuels, have long provided the state's energy. In 2017, the state received just over 20 percent of its energy from coal or natural gas, and its only coal power plant is on track to close. That reality has helped green Washington's politics and identity, especially in the western part of the state. Seattle made a commitment in 2002 to eliminate the city's carbon emissions from electricity, one of the first American cities to do so, and voters passed renewable energy standards in 2006. The state put a limit on emissions in 2008. But Initiative 1631 failed, and Washington must now confront a darker version of itself, in the kind of identity crisis that comes only in defeat.\IN THE PAST DECADE, the Northwest has seen a slew of wins in fights against carbon-emitting infrastructure - and a slew of losses on climate policy. KC Golden is a longtime climate campaigner and, until recently, a senior policy advisor at Climate Solutions, which helped craft Initiative 1631. Now almost 60, Golden claimed his first climate victory in the 1980s, when his group Northwest Energy Coalition was part of regional energy efficiency efforts. In those days, Golden was fighting the ""greenhouse effect,"" an early name for the warming effects of carbon dioxide, and he won support by pointing to both reduced energy costs and environmental benefits. By 2008, Golden had helped craft local and state commitments to clean energy, and climate activists stepped back, thinking their local fight was mostly over and the federal government would pick up the slack. President Barack Obama's White House seemed committed, along with much of the world, to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases through regulations and other incentives, with states like Washington, Oregon and California poised to help lead the way.\By 2010, the decline of the U.S. coal market had become obvious, and the fossil fuel industry began to eye the West Coast for access to Asian markets. ""They were holed up in the mountains with their coal, and they were trying to figure out where to go,"" Golden said. The West Coast offered the quickest way from coal country to China, and so began a wave of proposals for trains to haul the coal and for coastal terminals from Oakland, California, to Bellingham, Washington, to export it. The natural gas industry also began to swell, proposing a dozen separate refineries and terminals with their attendant pipelines and trains in Oregon and Washington.\Had every project been built, ""it would certainly make us one of the top fossil fuel transport hubs anywhere in the world,"" said Eric de Place, a programs director at the Sightline Institute, a nonprofit think tank focused on regional sustainability. In addition to concerns about air pollution and the safety of coal trains and gas pipelines, the proposals threatened the region's sense that it was a leader on climate change. ""So much of the region had already invested in its identity as being on the forefront of clean energy,"" Golden said. Climate activists drew what they called a ""thin, green line"" at the coastal Northwestern states, adopting a term coined by de Place to describe their role as a barricade against a fossil fuel boom.\The fight to block fossil fuel infrastructure drew widespread support in Washington and Oregon. The Keep It In The Ground movement, which opposes any new fossil fuel production, firmly established itself with direct action in ""Blockadia,"" as activists strapped themselves to a drill rig headed to the Arctic, blocked trains and demonstrated in the streets of Seattle and Portland. The rural communities of Hoquiam and Aberdeen unanimously banned new crude oil storage facilities in their towns. The Lummi Nation successfully killed a proposal for an export terminal for Montana coal outside Bellingham. In 2018, voters in Kalama, Washington, elected Mayor Mike Reuter, who promised to block construction of a plant for methanol, a fossil fuel with a heavy pollution fingerprint. In Oregon, voters elected a blue bloc of representatives, including Golden's brother Jeff in southern Oregon, who promised to block permits for an LNG export terminal at Jordan Cove.\Why were these so successful, compared to the carbon tax? Since 2013, legislative proposals for either cap-and-trade or carbon taxes have failed three times. A carbon tax failed on the ballot in 2016. In part, the problems with more abstract carbon-pricing proposals, including 1631, were societal and structural. ""(Fossil fuel companies) have spent centuries creating a system of dependency,"" Aiko Schaefer, one of the architects of 1631 and the director of Front and Centered, a climate advocacy coalition for people of color, said. Reimagining it will require a radical overhaul of societal structures, a process she thinks will take longer than an election cycle or two. ""We're trying to break free and make a fundamental shift in our society.""\And the difficulties with that shift run deep in the human psyche. Terminals, refineries and railways exist in the material realm, de Place said. ""If you take a mile-long coal train going through Seattle, it just doesn't look good,"" said de Place. ""We're animals, and we live in a physical world. That physicality did connect up the dots for people.""\PEOPLE ARE ANIMALS, yes, and political animals at that, forming loyal packs and scrapping over neighborhood HOAs, city councils, Congress and the courts. In the months since the vote, national climate politics have remained mired in feuding over partisan responsibility and inaction. But what killed the carbon tax was not a blind, party-line vote: the measure failed in red and blue strongholds alike. Of the 59 percent of Washingtonians who voted to re-elect Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat who supports aggressive climate action, about a quarter rejected the carbon tax. In the end, the measure passed in just three places: Seattle's King County, Port Townsend's Jefferson County and the county that encompasses the San Juan Islands.\The simplest explanation is that people just don't like taxes, and oil and gas outspent green groups to exploit that dislike. In Washington, fossil fuel companies and lobbyists spent more than $30 million to defeat Initiative 1631, versus $17 million from supporters. The solution, then, would seem to be to convince people they'll be just as well off before a carbon tax as after - and to match fossil fuel interests' spending dollar for dollar. But some observers say the challenges with raising taxes to pay for climate action run deeper.\Nives Dolšak and her husband, Aseem Prakash, are both professors, focused on climate change and its human dimensions, at the University of Washington, in Seattle, who spend their days studying climate policy and pushing environmentalists to reflect on their approach. I thought they could tell me what killed the carbon tax, and I spent many rambling hours on the phone with them, discussing the tax's details, and its flaws. Whichever one I'd call, I'd find them together: They have been married for 19 years and often greeted me in unison in a well-worn routine. Still, they argued about the relative importance of this or that point and right up to election night, they were divided on one key point.\""We disagreed on whether 1631 would pass,"" said Dolšak, a seriousseeming woman in her early 50s from Slovenia, speaking with a wry note in her voice. Dolšak thought it was doomed, while Prakash acknowledged ruefully, ""I thought it would pass.""\Not that Dolšak enjoyed being right; 1631's defeat left them both deflated, she said. ""It had all the structural factors in its favor,"" said Dolšak, from the menacing weather that preceded the vote to the overall support for climate action in the state. ""It had no business not passing.""\In the weeks after, as they ate dinner or got ready for work, they'd dissect the results: Is Washington turning conservative? Is any carbon tax doomed to fail? For Dolšak, the less optimistic of the two, the tax's failure reinforced her sense that sweeping climate action is far from imminent. ""When we're thinking of solutions, I'm thinking in two to four years,"" she said. She came to believe it was a failure of Washington's green selfmythology: ""In Washington, we're excited to support environmental action, as long as we don't have to pay for it,"" she said. ""If a carbon tax cannot pass in good economic times, in a pro-environment state like Washington, then action on climate is far more difficult than it used to seem."" Prakash's longer view gave him a more hopeful perspective, she said, forecasting what might happen thousands of years from now.\""That's the Hindu in me!"" Prakash quipped, meaning the tendency to think not just of this reincarnation, but the next and the one after that. Although he believes people will embrace climate action eventually, in the short term, he conceded, ""I think things are going to get worse before they get better.""\Prakash blamed environmentalists and their approach. ""The mainstream environmental groups are less willing to hear from the periphery,"" he said. They focus on consolidating a liberal base, he said, to their detriment. Many groups, including the Sierra Club and The Nature Conservancy, did not back an earlier carbon tax that was designed to appeal to more conservative voters. That, Prakash said, ""was myopic."" (Mo McBroom, director of government relations for The Nature Conservancy's Washington chapter, noted that 1631 differed from 732, as it ""would have provided investments to make our state more resilient to climate change, including reducing risk of forest fire and addressing drought"" and drew support from businesses, prominent philanthropists like Bill Gates, and health professionals.)\In the wake of the election, the couple published half a dozen pieces analyzing the failure that drew on their own discussions. ""Nives and I have not given up on conversation,"" Prakash said. ""It comes out as a family compromise."" What they arrived at was simple: The failure of 1631 was about more than a deep-pocketed oil and gas campaign machine; it spoke to climate action's broader challenges. ""We have anecdotal evidence that money doesn't lead to electoral success,"" Prakash said. And the messaging of the ""No"" on 1631 campaign fed on the rich vein of discontent around accountability for the funds the tax would raise, as well as the worry that voters, rather than large-scale polluters, would end up paying for the cost of climate change.\STILL, IT WASN'T ADVERTISING campaigns or partisanship alone that killed the tax: it got mired in the same murk that has slowed climate action for decades. The climate is too big for us to easily wrap our minds around, and so it proves to be a difficult issue to legislate. This election cycle, Jordan Stevenson was a fellow at the advocacy group Our Climate, which supported Washington's carbon tax. A 20-year-old woman with square glasses and a knack for getting people to talk, she spent weeks knocking on doors in the Spokane area, on the far eastern side of the state, along with her husband. She also talked to her father, back home in Vancouver. ""He said, 'I'm glad you're working on this,' "" she told me. "" 'I'll take a look.' "" But in the end, she's not sure he even voted. When she spoke to voters in Spokane, not many people there knew what the tax was, let alone what it had to do with the wildfire smoke outside their windows. ""It still didn't seem concrete or tangible to people,"" Stevenson said. Voters told her: ""The money I pay in taxes, the increase at the gas pump, it will never benefit me.""\Initiative 1631's demise might have had something to do with moments like this, where the connection between taxing carbon and more immediate fears about one's health or one's job becomes obscured. The initiative promised to pool funds for projects, including new bus lines, land conservation grants, and training to transition fossil fuel workers into other jobs. But when people need to choose between their day-to-day concerns and a future pot of money for projects they can't imagine, the day-to-day wins. Our minds are better suited to immediate threats - like snarling hyenas or flammable trains - and we struggle with the abstract dangers of a changing climate.\""People don't get worried about problems that aren't happening today or tomorrow,"" Dolšak said. Those climate hawks who believe that extreme weather events, like wildfires and hurricanes, will inspire climate inactivists are overly optimistic, Prakash said. ""An extreme weather event doesn't affect political leanings."" Ongoing, intensifying hurricanes in Florida, for example, have not necessarily driven people to vote for liberal candidates who back climate action, and extreme weather has a relatively small impact on public opinion.\""A lot of environmentalists are approaching conservation and pollution reduction from a normative perspective: We have to reduce pollution and protect the environment,"" Dolšak told me. Instead, the question is over the cost required to take action: ""How much is society willing to pay to reduce this problem versus another, equally important problem?""\Despite the work of scientists and researchers, whose models are getting better at explaining the chaotic relationships between climate and weather, the truth is that the destructiveness of a particular storm is hard to link straight to a changing climate - what experts call ""the attribution problem."" Smoky summer days in Idaho can seem far removed from a tax, or fee, that will somehow reduce carbon emissions, somehow slow climate change, and somehow decrease wildfires. In this way, climate change can boggle the imagination. Unsurprisingly, the carbon tax found wide support among the state's tribal nations, some of whom face the obvious possibility of displacement due to rising seas, and in Seattle's communities of color, where air pollution already causes higher-than-average rates of asthma.\In short, the difficulty of addressing climate stems from its very power: Its effects are inextricable from the way we have configured our society. If we have to name 1631's killer, it might be what geographer Mike Hulme called the ""climate of climate change."" Hulme, an expert in climate change theory at the University of Cambridge, argues that our concept of climate is only partly rooted in objective truths about the material world. At least as powerful is the fact that climate fundamentally formed human cultures, contributing to our idea of it as static. It is impossible to separate ourselves from the climate far enough to get a clear look at it, something equally true of many injustices and economic structures. All of these things are wrapped together, but the climate is changing, and so must our analysis of it.\""All aspects of human life are now analyzed or represented in relation to climate: gender, violence, literature, security, architecture, the imagination, football, tourism, spirituality, ethics, and so on,"" Hulme wrote. ""All human practices and disputes can now be expressed through the language of climate change, which has become a new medium through which human life is lived.""\Given this, the fight over what to do about rising temperatures epitomizes all our other disagreements over what justice - let alone climate justice - might, and should, look like. For example, Stevenson, the canvasser, was first drawn to climate activism through her interest in reproductive health and justice: ""There are areas where people's children are not growing up healthy because they're breathing in fumes or drinking fossil fuels in their water,"" she said. She used that argument to talk to her dad about climate change, invoking his sense of familial values and his worry for his kids and grandkids. The fight for the carbon tax, then, becomes a fight for what the future of our society ought to look like - and on that, we remain deeply conflicted.\SOME SAY THE DEATH OF THE CARBON TAX was easily foreseen. ""The word 'tax' is probably the most reviled word,"" said Hal Harvey, CEO of the firm Energy Innovation, which helps design renewable energy policies around the globe. ""The first lesson is: Don't lead with your chin."" Harvey, an energy wonk with a cheery, blunt manner, said the state's climate coalition should have pushed for more immediately achievable ends first, such as fuel efficiency standards modeled on California's, or tighter building regulations. ""If you had to choose between performance standards and a carbon tax, you'd be insane to pick a carbon tax,"" said Harvey.\Dolšak tends to agree: She hypothesized that even cap-and-trade, which often amounts to the same thing as a carbon tax, might have passed in the state, given that it sidesteps the word tax and directly limits emissions. A quirk of state law classified 1631 as a fee, evoking a parking ticket for emitting, rather than a cost to everyday consumers, but most voters identified it as a tax.\Economists generally support a carbon tax over regulations or building standards, because it costs all emitters fairly, in proportion to their emissions. A building standard, for example, might require different windows, different insulation, a different design ... and by the time you're done, it's hard to disentangle what you did from what you might have done otherwise, and even harder to say how much more money per ton of carbon was effective. In practice, however, many key emitters are relatively unaffected by a carbon tax. Those who build new buildings are rarely the ones paying the energy bills, so a tax on emissions is more likely to hit the building's occupants.\On the other hand, voters - most of whom aren't economists - tend to prefer energy standards because they put the costs on those most directly responsible for carbon-emitting systems, the real estate developers and car designers. And although the cost of new standards varies between industries, within them, the costs are the same. An engineer at Volvo isn't likely to compare her efficiency costs to those of double-paned windows in a new high-rise. Rather, she'll look to her competitor at Peugeot, who is under the same constraints.\Washington may already be learning its lesson. Less than a month after the carbon tax failed, Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat who backed it and has suggested that he might run for president on a climate change platform, held a press conference to announce a new green legislative deal. ""This is the greatest endeavor of our time,"" he told a crowd of reporters at a workspace for energy efficiency innovators in Seattle. ""It is a moment of great peril but it is also a moment of great promise."" He unveiled a plan he hopes to put before the state Legislature this year, one that encompasses clean fuel standards, tighter building codes and a shift to 100 percent clean energy.\The time for a carbon tax will come, Harvey said. The warming climate will produce - in fact, it is already producing - challenges that altered consumption habits and more efficient buildings can't pay for. The costs of relocating communities farther inland from the coasts, for example, won't be recouped from sales of Teslas. But for now climate activists are stuck with the art of the possible. ""The essence of strategy is making choices,"" Harvey said. "" 'Everything' is not a choice.""\IN THE WEEKS AFTER THE DEATH of 1631, climate activists took little time to grieve, refusing to declare defeat. This wasn't the end, they swore; it was just the beginning. ""2019 is a year we can make a lot of progress on this,"" Nick Abraham, a spokesman for the Yes on 1631 campaign, told me. ""We've moved the conversation away from, 'Should we take action?' to, 'What should action look like?' ""\""I want to make sure people don't take the vote count and say, 'Pffft,' and move on,"" Schaefer, the head of Front and Centered and one of 1631's designers, said. ""When my kid plays soccer, when he loses a game, I don't say, 'Don't play soccer anymore.' ""\But if climate hawks want to make progress, they'll need to grapple with the cause of death for Initiative 1631. Not long ago, I met Golden in a noisy coffee shop a little over a mile away from the site of the election night failure, for a final postmortem. He was in a reflective mood: Climate Solutions was in the midst of moving offices, and they'd unearthed years of news clippings on the long fight for climate action in the state, records of campaigns and failures going back more than a decade. Golden's mind was on what would come next, including setting aside the fight for a carbon tax, for now. ""Carbon pricing is not our quest,"" he said, his voice both uptempo and steady. Carbon taxes are just a tool. ""Our quest is to deal with climate change.""\Without a course correction, climate activists may well find themselves right back where they started, raising the body count on failed climate initiatives while blithely marching forward. In Canada, for example, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced blowback for his carbon tax proposal. And not long after the U.S. midterms, France underwent a major political crisis, brought in part by a fuel tax meant to curb emissions. In the U.S., advocates are crafting an economic stimulus package - a Green New Deal. And there, at least, they seem to have taken the hint: That package sidesteps a carbon tax entirely.\Over a cup of tea, Golden dissected, and then dissected again, the faults of the tax and the future of climate action. ""The fundamentals are there,"" he concluded. But the moral urgency, the sense that life after oil is a real possibility, the feeling that anything useful can be done - those aren't. In Washington, even as winter faltered and delivered a meager snowpack, concerns over climate change had been quickly replaced by more immediate worries: a federal shutdown and a volatile stock exchange. So even if a majority of Americans believe in climate change, that statistic amounts to very little. It's just another thing to worry about, on a heaping plate of worry.\What, then, should we take away from the death of 1631? The big lesson is that we need to seek the root cause of our worries, clarify our fears and to face them head on. Golden thinks the first step is to regain a sense that our collective actions can actually affect the course of climate change. On our dependence on fossil fuels, ""we're fighting something that's dying,"" Golden told me. ""We're just not on the same timeline as physics."" Climate change is not just an environmental problem or an economic problem, and it can't be framed that way. It's a challenge to our moral imagination - and a big one. Putting a policy to that will be as daunting as it is urgent.\We finished our drinks and parted ways. Outside, the winter weather was particularly nasty, with rain that flew sideways and high winds shoving people around the sidewalks. I made my way through the streets, my thoughts scattered, and before I could really think through all I'd just learned, a gust of wind caught me by surprise and nearly slammed me into a building. I stumbled down a flight of stairs looking for somewhere to retreat to, but there was nothing around but bad weather."
19,"Bumpy road ahead \Improving transportation will cost taxpayers \It was certainly no surprise that Gov. Bill Ritter's Blue Ribbon Transportation Commission recommended more spending to address the state's growing transportation needs. A drive along most of the state roads or highways in Colorado reveals the need for more maintenance and, in some cases, new construction. Some maintenance has been put off while legislators poached highway funds for other projects. \Also no surprise was where the panel planned to get that money: higher taxes and more fees. There are few places in the budget for the state to trim to come up with the $1.5 billion the panel says the state needs to spend to improve Colorado's roads and bridges. Except maybe if legislators put back the millions they've siphoned off from transportation funding to finance other projects. \According to a Gazette news report last week, the panel recommended raising the gas tax, sales tax and fees on vehicle registrations and a few other taxes and fees when it presented its report to Ritter. The report also contained a blueprint on how to spend the money the panel wants to see flowing the state's way. \Transportation funding comes from state and federal gas taxes and a portion of the sales and use tax revenue that exceeds the 6 percent growth cap on the general fund. With the passage of Referendum C allowing the state to keep excess revenue, there should be plenty of money for road maintenance and construction. Except, according to a Gazette story earlier this year, lawmakers have been shifting money around to ensure their projects get funding before transportation. Since one of the selling points for passing Referendum C was increased highway spending, it seems dishonest to shift money around and shortchange transportation. Legislators should return that money before asking Coloradans for more. \Barring that, lawmakers should take a close look at the panel's recommendations for divvying up the proceeds from the tax and fee hikes. They call for about $538 million to go to increasing the safety and maintenance of highways, including improvements to bridges. Local roads would get about $293 million and another $107 for ""transit, environmental needs and bike and pedestrian pathways."" Depending on project specifics, we might quibble with using transportation money for bike and pedestrian trails if they're intended primarily for recreation rather than transportation. A long, scenic bike path is nice for a weekend ride, but few people want to ride their bikes miles out of their way to get and from work. \Our real concern is the $562 million the panel says should be spent on ""mobility needs."" We're on board with the $60 million for speeding up construction projects on major roads. The rest of the money, roughly $502 million, is where the trouble lies. The panel divides the money equally; one $251 million fund going to transit projects and the other going to either highway expansion or transit, depending on the needs of the state. \The first fund would finance ""interregional transit projects such as creating a Front Range commuter rail,"" according to The Gazette's story. That's an editorial for another day and we'll revisit that if this proposal goes to the voters. \The second fund is particularly troubling, since it has the potential to become a political football. According to the story, the ""biggest fight on the 32-person commission was about whether to put more of the mobility funding toward buses and trains or toward more driving lanes."" \If a 32-member commission can't agree on the proper mix of highways and transit, imagine how difficult it will be for the entire state. Politicians and advocates will be in a continual tugof-war to see their favorite projects get funding. \The governor will decide whether to back putting this idea before the voters. We'll wait to see the final proposal before we make up our minds. Building and maintaining roads and highways is a legitimate function of government, but those needs shouldn't be held hostage to the social engineering inherent in transit projects. The panel's recommendations could face a bumpy road ahead. \EU forcing warming 'solution' on others \If other nations hamstring their economies with dubious plans to save the planet, we won't argue with them. But, inevitably, commissars' power grabs seek to control others. Last week the European Union voted to impose carbon dioxide emission reductions starting in 2011 on airlines flying into Europe, as well as within the continent. \The New York Times described the EU scheme as ""a global warming control plan that would require"" emissions be offset by buying CO2 credits in a cap-and-trade market. \Whether one considers climate change a catastrophic danger or a benign natural occurrence, the EU action is first and most importantly about controlling others. The contrived emissions market is the EU's principal anti-global warming tool. It limits how much CO2 industries may emit. Companies may exceed limits if they buy credits, or sell surplus credits to others if they stay under limit. \""Carbon trading is excellent for the fraudster, good for the robber baron, ineffective for the environment, bad for the economy as a whole and disastrous for the poor,"" writes Iain Murray, senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Despite negligible effect on CO2 emissions, energy prices skyrocketed. \The cap-and-trade auction system operating in Europe since 2005 is an ""administrative nightmare"" that imposes huge costs on businesses and results in job losses, says U.K. Think tank Open Europe. Now the EU wants to extend this disaster to airlines, and not just European carriers. No wonder the United States and the International Civil Aviation Organization oppose it. We do, too."

The Legislature should foster an environment of less government, less regulation and lower taxes. Specifically, the business personal property tax should be eliminated.\2. No, more can be done to address this critical issue facing the state of Colorado. Specifically, the state needs to enforce the applicable laws already in place and add legislation that would require secure and verifiable documents as proof of citizenship to register to vote.\3. Overall, the barriers in energy development must be removed with streamlining solar permitting and promoting an environment of regulatory certainty for energy development.

Illegal immigration is a federal problem with state consequences. Our Legislature's many bills to penalize employers who hire undocumented workers and deny them benefits, though well intended, have been largely ineffective. We need to hold Congress accountable and support a federal immigration policy that satisfies both our employment and security needs.\3. The government should encourage the advancement of renewable energy by creating and expanding tax incentives for consumers to use it, creating research tax credits that promote the growth of the renewable energy industry and encourage the commercialization of viable technologies. Colorado should offer incentives for renewable energy companies to relocate to Colorado."
21,"When Mike Battaglia walked into the woods of the Pike National Forest on a sunny, late winter day, he pointed to the mature ponderosa pines — their needles assembled into bulbous groups, their burnt-orange bark furrowed into scaly plates and the buds of their egg-shaped cones.\Their plum branches towered over smatterings of young Douglas firs, brittle juniper bushes and dead litter. The position of their limbs — far enough from the ground to escape the reach of flames running on the forest floor — is part of why Battaglia loves these trees.\“Ponderosa pines are tough,” said the Fort Collins-based U.S. Forest Service research forester. “They can handle fire and drought.”\But then, he noted the saplings tall enough to prove that wildfire — natural or prescribed — has not run through the hill just south of the town of Buffalo Creek. A spot like this should burn every 20 to 40 years, Battaglia said, and it hasn’t.\If a wildfire sparks here, fast-moving flames could explode out of the abundance of dry fuels. That, in turn, could hurt soil retention, watershed health, wildlife habitat and even carbon emissions.\Colorado forests have emitted more carbon dioxide — the primary greenhouse gas contributing to climate change — than they have absorbed since 1990, according to a new analysis by the nonprofit American Forests. Years spent combating the maelstrom of flames, beetle infestations, drought and other aggressors have compromised the forests’ collective immune system.\Trees removed about 16 percent of atmospheric carbon released by human activities in the U.S. in 2011 and between 10 percent and 20 percent each year, the Forest Service estimates. But, as forests in the Colorado Rockies are destroyed by severe fire and massive beetle kills-offs — two well-documented harbingers of climate change — one of the Earth’s prime defense mechanisms against a warming planet erodes.\“We know climate change is happening, so how do we prepare the landscape for it?” Battaglia said. He is among those setting aside despair and opting to search for solutions to save the state’s vast forests.\Larger, more calamitous wildfires started to consistently hit Colorado in the 1990s, notably the 12,000-acre Buffalo Creek fire in 1996. Coloradans’ ears would perk up at the mention of a new conflagration, Battaglia said. Everything changed when the Hayman fire razed more than 137,000 acres of the Pike National Forest during an anomalously dry 2002.\Unlike blazes of the past that burned moderately with pockets of high-severity areas, 43 percent of the Hayman fire burn area was scorched, Colorado State University researchers found. In areas with few if any surviving trees, the dominant species — ponderosa pine — struggled to regenerate at lower elevation 12 years later, according to a 2014 survey.\“The landscape was once dominated by ponderosa pine and some Douglas fir,” said Marin Chambers, the paper’s lead scientist and a research associate at the Colorado Forest Restoration Institute. “Now, in that same spot in a high-severity burn area, you’d see it’s completely devoid of trees, except for some standing dead. But most have fallen down at this point.”\The seeds of ponderosa pines, which are heavy and generally cannot disperse more than two tree heights away from their parent trees, toiled to spread and root across the blistered hillsides. Even with enough precipitation, few seeds sprouted and rooted in the singed soil, restricting the forest’s range.\Chambers said the research, published in 2016, is an attempt to understand the future of forests, specifically how they rebound from major disturbances amidst climate change. In parts of the Hayman fire burn scar, that could mean a decadeslong absence of the conifer trees that Coloradans once wound through on hikes, bikes and horseback.\But, as Chambers’ colleague Paula Fornwalt found, other flora are flourishing where the trees once grew. There, a community of native species — blue grama, hairy golden aster, various sedges — as well as less common plants like mullein have found a home.\“We can talk about fire (like the Hayman) being catastrophic for trees,” Fornwalt said, “but the same language can’t be applied to understory, which seems to be pretty resilient. Not only that, it seems to thrive.”\Scientists also found American three-toed woodpeckers nesting in the recently killed and dying trees where they could forage for wood-boring and bark beetles. Though less common where trees have vanished, the black and white bird found ideal habitat in moderately burned areas.\The collage of ecological research complicates the narrative that wildfire is exclusively a predator, consuming every living creature in its path. Though a landscape may not resemble how modern Coloradans remember it, life will return.\“In my mind, we should think about the ecosystem as a whole and recognize that some areas are doing OK and some aren’t doing so well,” Fornwalt said. “It’s analogous to thinking about your health: Maybe your blood pressure is high, but your weight is good and cholesterol are good. We’re holistic and paint a picture that way to avoid blanket statements.”\But, it’s the loss of the forest and its ability to capture carbon that frightens David Cleaves.\With more sound forest management, trees could sequester enough carbon emissions to offset between $125.5 billion and more than $1.5 trillion in costs in the U.S., the Forest Service estimates. These totals are based on the avoided social costs of carbon emissions, including the destruction of property from flooding and other natural disasters, reduced agricultural yields from drought and exacerbation of health problems like asthma and other respiratory issues.\Cleaves, the former climate change adviser to the chief of the Forest Service, believes that restoring forest health is as much of a “key strategic asset” to the fight against warming as economic solutions, including a carbon tax and cap-and-trade programs.\“Our central mission is to help mainstream forests as solutions to climate change, both from the greenhouse gas management side and the side of adaptation to climate change,” Cleaves said.\But the viability of this goal was in question after Cleaves and American Forests analyzed the forestry inventory data for Intermountain West states to determine the carbon stored in live, dead standing and fallen trees, understory, forest litter and the soil. Colorado — as well as Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Montana and Arizona — had “flipped over from a solution to actually part of the problem” at various intervals since 1990. Idaho and New Mexico were the only states to remain carbon sinks.\“We’ve taken it for granted that our forests are capturing and offsetting greenhouse gases from other sources in the rest of the economy,” he said.\During a wildfire, the combustion of trees is an immediate carbon source, one that residents far and near can see and sometimes feel in the air. Historically, the regrowth of the forest compensates for this source in the long term. But, as Chambers’ research and that of others show, regeneration in high-severity burn areas after vast wildfires is tough, especially in a water-sparse state like Colorado.\Then, there are the bugs. The bark beetle population swelled radically in Colorado in 2018, especially in the southwest corner. Spruce beetle attacked 178,000 acres of Engelmann spruce. Although that’s fewer than the 260,000 acres in 2017 and the 250,000 in 2016, about one-third of the acres chewed up last year were in previously unaffected areas. The roundheaded pine beetle in southwest Colorado more than doubled its presence to 27,000 acres, up from 11,000 acres in 2017, mostly in Dolores County.\Largely to blame were the state’s second-worst drought in 124 years and record-breaking heat, said Dan West, an entomologist with the Colorado State Forest Service.\“It doesn’t mean forest managers are doing a bad job; it just means that bugs and fire and drought are doing a good job,” Cleaves said.\Last year, 502 wildfires ran across more than 475,000 acres in Colorado. The state government and Forest Service spent $40.1 million and $120.3 million, respectively, on suppression. For the Forest Service, that’s nearly three times more than the $42 million it doled out for wildfire suppression during the 2017 fire season in Colorado.\The blazes emptied more than just the government’s wallet. Near Durango, the 416 fire ravaged the local summer recreation economy. In La Veta, the Spring Creek fire obliterated more than 200 structures and swept across 108,000 acres, making it the third-largest wildfire in Colorado history.\And fire could get worse.\By the middle of the century, the annual acreage burned in the West could expand by two to six times, according to an analysis in the federal government’s 2018 Fourth National Climate Assessment. Estimates made in 2017 show that about 2.9 million Coloradans are in the line of fire.\The length of the fire season — which some have now dubbed the “fire year” — increased 18.7 percent between 1979 and 2013, an article published in 2015 in Nature Communications shows. The study also found that terrestrial carbon uptake was lower during years with longer-than-average fire weather seasons.\More volatile snowpack, alongside drought and heat, will also amplify wildfire frequency and intensity, said Mike Lester, director of the state’s Forest Service. Though Colorado’s snowpack was 126 percent of median by mid-April this year, the snowpack was a mere 68 percent of median by April 1, 2018. It was one of seven years since 2000 that the snowpack peaked notably below average, compared with only one year between 1984 and 1999, federal snowpack data shows.\“If the snowpack doesn’t stay into the spring and early summer, the fire season is longer, and weather events and drought are also more extreme,” he said. “That’s the way it’s going to be, so we’re trying to get out in front of people to try to tell them how important the forest is.\“I have no ability to make climate go back to normal,” Lester said. “But I can make the forest healthy as a contribution to (climate change mitigation).”\Deep in the mountains just northeast of Pagosa Springs, Mike Battaglia may have a piece of the solution to forest health in a changing climate in Colorado. There, the research forester has mapped about 500 acres between 7,000 and 8,000 feet elevation of a thick conglomerate of ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, white fir, aspen and shrubby Gambel oak.\In his eyes, each tree and each species are an opportunity.\He could haul away the drought and fire susceptible white firs; group the ponderosa pines in small, spaced out clusters that mimic how they may have been paired 200 years ago; and, eventually, ignite prescribed fires that torch some trees but nourish others.\This plot is his laboratory, one where he and his colleagues will manipulate the physical makeup of the landscape as it cycles through wildfire, beetles, drought, record low and high snowfall and other natural events during the next 20-plus years. The goal: create a forest that is resistant to change, resilient to disturbances and prepared to transition to the unknown future climate.\“My job is to maximize multiple use and get the ecosystem processes back while still producing timber, and also providing for wildlife habitat, watershed health, understory plants and other parts of the environment,” said Battaglia, who hopes to start treatments this summer. “That’s why I went into this field. I want to do the right thing and make sure everyone does the right thing for the forest.”\Battaglia is not alone in his quest for restored forest equilibrium, either. His project is one of five experiments across the country that are exploring how humans can manufacture more robust forests in Georgia, Minnesota, Montana and New Hampshire.\“With forest management, we need to work with what we have and anticipate what it might be in 50 years,” said Linda Nagle, who leads the national project and is a forestry professor at Colorado State University. “And that’s different than 50 years ago when we didn’t think conditions would change. … This change is so rapid, too.”\“If we aren’t proactive to anticipate those changes quickly, we may lose the values in the forest that we’ve taken for granted for so long,” she said.\Colorado’s proactivity may be restricted compared with the others that forest managers are working to restore because of an emaciated timber market. Between 1982 and 2012 the number of sawmills producing lumber in the state declined from 84 to 31, the Forest Service found. Fewer broad feet can be processed in-state, and the wood that stays within Colorado’s borders often has to travel farther once it’s chopped down.\With no market, the transport costs — and the emissions released during the haul — exceed the payoff for the product and disincentivize contractors from signing onto the project.\“The biggest cost to that now is that we don’t have the infrastructure and, where we do, it’s too far away,” Battaglia said.\But, in Minnesota, where the timber market is thriving, the San Juan site’s sister project has so far generated about $1 million in wood byproduct sales, Nagle said. Just another thread to weave into the story of restoring forest health in Colorado.\“It’s really complex here,” Nagle said. “The solution isn’t simple.”\Someday, the Colorado wilderness may not resemble the thick belts of trees in peoples’ backyards across the Western Slope and Front Range, she said. Maybe they will have metamorphosed into a hillside of shrubs like the areas of the Hayman burn scar. Maybe they’ll even contain species not native to Colorado but more adapted to this new environment.\That reality forces us to re-imagine what our environment can and should look like.\As Marin Chambers put it, “There are a lot of interesting ecological impacts of the change from forested landscape to a prolonged nonforest landscape or an ecotype conversion. But I have a lot of questions to put back on the public. What do (they) want and desire and need out of these landscapes?”\Those questions invite the public to be proactive in a challenge that is of global scale with hyperlocal implications.\The answers will determine the future of our forests and whether, when Battaglia is retired walking through the woods, he can still find that sweet smell of butterscotch wafting from the ponderosa pines that he has come to love so much.\Twitter: @lizmforster Phone: 636-0193"
22,"Political and economic realities threaten the Obama administration and the European Union's mutual quest to combat global warming. Temperatures aren't helping much, either. Globally the warming trend effectively ended more than a decade ago.\These inconvenient facts don't bode well for December's climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, where campaigners against global warming had hoped to arrive at a worldwide pact for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.\In addition to sizable political and economic conflicts stalling European and U.S. efforts, developing nations also are gumming up plans for a worldwide solution to the presumed threat.\China, India and other developing nations insist on receiving subsidies or even outright payments from developed nations like the United States, either as compensation for alleged harm suffered from the more prosperous nations' greenhouse-gas emissions, or to pay for reducing their own emissions. African nations last week said they need $65 billion to cope with global warming's effects, essentially making an argument for reparations.\The fervent quest to curb greenhouse-gas emissions is worrisome enough, considering that the science allegedly proving the threat is increasingly shown to be faulty or even fraudulent. But, as is also increasingly obvious to those expected to foot the bill, proposed Draconian ""solutions"" to this likely nonexistent problem will do more harm than good.\Government curbs on greenhouse gases certainly will retard economic growth, while promising only unproven environmental gains. As India and China demonstrate, developing nations know curbing emissions means curbing economic well-being, a price they are unwilling to pay without at least being compensated.\The reality is that undeveloped nations are more polluted nations. Cleaning up the environment is not a top priority where people don't have enough to eat. For such nations, definite economic growth trumps reducing possible global warming of a degree or two. If this is abundantly clear to developing nations, it's becoming increasingly clear to those already developed.\Europe's cap-and-trade scheme was undermined recently by a Court of First Instance ruling that annulled the EU's attempt to lower Estonia and Poland's carbon emissions. ""The court said setting carbon limits is a matter for member states rather than the EU,"" reported EurActiv network.\The EU, unable to bring its own member nations in line, also is frustrated with the lack of progress in the U.S. The Obama administration is meeting staunch resistance in Congress to imposing similar restrictions on American industry, undermining the Copenhagen mission.\While these developments bode ill for worldwide Draconian regulations, they are good news for those who know prosperity is the best route to cleaner environment, irrespective of a degree or two increase or decline in temperature over the next century."

Free market environmentalists are everywhere these days, but you rarely hear about them in the mainstream press.
\
Conventional wisdom for our entire lifetimes has been that only government protection can minimize or prevent environmental damage. The idea that markets are better at managing natural resources than governments may come as a shock to some, but the simple reason is that private property owners have more incentive and control to take care of property they own.
\
Terry Anderson, executive director of the Property and Environment Research Center in Bozeman, Mont., made this case in his groundbreaking book ""Free Market Environmentalism,"" co-authored with Donald Leal in 1991. It's well past time these ideas get more attention.
\
In his June 25 Wall Street Journal article ""Why it's safer to drill in the backyard,"" Anderson explains an aspect of the current Gulf oil spill disaster you won't find in most media outlets.
\
He refers to the Audubon Society's successful relationship with oil companies who have operated wells on its lands, but only when birds weren't nesting. Period. None of the ifs, ands and buts that are always present when politicians and special interests try to manipulate public land use.
\
Why would Audubon allow well drilling on its environmentally sensitive lands? To generate royalties for the purchase of more privately owned land that can then be protected.
\
Private organizations like Audubon are much better stewards of the environment than government. For an outrageous example of government failure, look no further than the ongoing Gulf oil spill, where available options for a speedy cleanup were set aside and President Barack Obama's political agenda rose to the top, like his never-ending refrains about alternative energy, cap-and-trade taxes and punishing the deep-water wells that did not blow out.
\
None of these have anything to do with the current disaster, a masterful example of bait-and-switch by an expert politician.
\
The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, aka the Jones Act, which prohibits using ships and equipment not owned by Americans to protect labor unions from competition, could have been waived immediately after the spill. North Atlantic countries with extensive ocean drilling experience immediately offered their sophisticated oil-skimming equipment, but the offer was declined by the U.S. government.
\
After several weeks, National Incident Commander Admiral Allen said, ""No one has asked me to waive the Jones Act.""
\
Finally, after two months, procedures for waiving the Jones Act were developed. This is how government responds to media pressure, a completely different skill than actually solving problems -- or at least getting out of the way.
\
Under the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, liability for future oil spills was limited to $75 million in most situations. The combination of public ownership (ensuring political instead of economic resource allocation), government-limited liability and government restrictions reducing drilling locations all but assured BP's shoddy workmanship in the current disaster.
\
Anyone who thinks the free market is to blame for such problems hasn't been paying attention to the last century of increasing government interference in every aspect of the economy, including business and other subsidies that discourage accountability.
\
As a collapsing worldwide economy unfolds from a century of unsustainable public debt, counterproductive and idealistic promises of government stewardship are finally being revealed for what they are -- a flawed comparison between market realities with government fantasies that never seem to work in the long run.

This act continues the Bush agenda of relentless attacks on our environment. It weakens the Clean Air Act requirement that aging power plants must add anti-pollution technology when they expand and increase pollution. ""Clear Skies"" attempts to redefine the dangers and delay pollution cuts, putting off cleaner air for many more years.\Martinez tries to dismiss the dangers of CO2. Ever hear of greenhouse gases and global warming? Please refer to the March 7 Coloradoan front-page story about carbon dioxide levels threatening prairie life and degrading pasture for ranchers.\The ""Clear Skies Act"" claims to reduce mercury, one of the most poisonous chemicals emitted from power plants. The cap and trade policy would allow larger polluters to buy credits and avoid mercury cuts in the most polluted communities. Delaying enforcement to 2018 unnecessarily endangers our children for 13 more years.\The Bush Administration has a habit of labeling its anti-environmental legislation with pretty and positive titles like ""Clear Skies"" and ""Healthy Forests."" The purpose is to mislead, hoping that we will not discover the destructive details.\Martinez states that the power companies are all in favor of ""Clear Skies."" Of course they are. Isn't that a big red flag? The corporate world has indicated over the past few years they have one major goal, ""Healthy Profits,"" certainly not healthy citizens or a healthy environment. Apparently, President Bush has exactly the same priorities.\Judy Sorbie-Dunn,\Fort Collins\PVH must change protocol\Today, I visited a patient at Poudre Valley Hospital.

If we, as parents (community) establish a foundation with these characteristics in place, we will not need more laws. It is our great opportunity to be involved with and influence our kids. It is our responsibility to teach our kids life skills, character traits, money management, morals and yes, responsible consumption of alcohol.\Why do we leave these lessons to our public school system, lawmakers and the courts? We look to our leaders to establish and enforce rules (laws) that will ensure the safety of our children, but are we willing to spend the time and energy necessary to establish the kind of relationship that will promote safety, trust and good judgment?\Our community is full of resources.

25,"
About a dozen local guys, several in camouflage baseball caps, are playing pool or slouching on maroon vinyl barstools in the dim light of the Popular Bar in Craig, Colorado. We're in the heart of the state's coal country, a country that feels like it's at war. Nearly everyone here on this August Monday night is a laborer, electrician or retiree from the nearby coal mines or the big coal-fired power plant at the edge of town. The loud music is punctuated by the sharp clack of pool balls.
\
The two clean-cut young men, whose pool game I've interrupted, at first seem willing to talk to a reporter. They've worked in both surface and underground mines, they say, and have young families to support. They explain how important coal is to their community. Then, unexpectedly, the taller one, whose T-shirt's cut-off sleeves reveal sculpted arms, erupts in anger and threatens me for invading his bar. Implausibly, he seems to want to fight a middle-aged * female reporter. The photographer who accompanied me *n 1 - ^appears and deftly distracts the man.
\
The other miner, Nick Craig, has a compact build and short blond hair. Unruffled by his friend's hostility, this Iraq war veteran calmly explains that tempers have been short here ever since a judge threatened to shut down a nearby surface mine called Colowyo. ""Coal is our life,"" Craig says. ?You can't just turn it off. If you do, this town is dead."" At another table, a big man with a grizzled goatee pauses, pool cue in hand, and declares that he'll never again drink any New Belgium beer. In fact, several local bars and restaurants are boycotting the popular Fort Collins brewery because it has donated to WildEarth Guardians.
\
But most of their ire is directed at Jeremy Nichols, WildEarth Guardians' climate and energy program director. Nichols has become a household name here - a rare feat for an environmentalist - since he sued the federal government for approving Colowyo's expansion without considering its impact on the climate. By doing so, he thrust Craig into the center of the struggle over the government's coal program, and made the locals painfully aware of how precarious their livelihoods are.
\
Nichols, 35, is among the most audacious of a small but growing group of activists determined to overhaul and eventually shut down the federal coal program to help avert a climate crisis. Some 40 percent of the coal used to generate electricity in the U.S. comes from federally owned reserves mined by private companies. The companies pay more than $1.5 billion per year in royalties and other fees to the federal government, money that's shared with the states. Despite President Barack Obama's commitment to make the U.S. a world leader on climate change, the coal program, run by the Bureau of Land Management, has largely escaped reform. Nichols wants to expose the contradiction between the administration's climate agenda and its coal program by relentlessly attacking one mine expansion after another.
\
""The only surefire way we see to make the federal coal program consistent with our need to combat climate change is to start to keep it in the ground,"" Nichols says. ""We shouldn't be authorizing any more coal mining in this day and age, with our understanding of climate change and our need to reduce greenhouse gases. The Interior Department shouldn't be making it easier for the industry to mine and burn coal.""
\
There's a clear logic to this approach: If you don't want carbon in the air, leave the raw materials that produce it in the ground. Yet environmentalists and government agencies have so long ignored this supply-side strategy that it is considered downright radical, in the everyday sense of the word as well as its literal meaning - that is, getting at the root of the problem. For decades, environmentalists have tried to rid the air of pollution caused by fossil fuels, but they've always targeted combustion, working to clean up exhaust pipes or smokestacks, rather than shutting down oilfields or coal mines. The Sierra Club's ""Beyond Coal"" campaign, for instance, figures it accomplishes more by closing coal-fired power plants. So it dedicates only about $1 million of its $30 million annual budget to trying to keep coal in the ground, says Bruce Nilles, campaign director. Accordingly, the centerpiece of Obama's climate agenda, his Clean Power Plan, focuses on smokestacks, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.
\
But recently, the battle against climate change has moved up the production chain. Activists started focusing on transportation of fossil fuels, trying to halt the construction of new export terminals for coal and liquid natural gas and the Keystone XL pipeline, which would move tar sands from Alberta, Canada, to Southern U.S. refineries and ports. If you can't get the fuel to market, why take it out of the ground? The heart of the antiKeystone movement is the group 350.org and its founder, Bill McKibben, who told Rolling Stone that ""effective action would require actually keeping most of the carbon the fossil-fuel industry wants to burn safely in the soil."" One study published in January in the journal Nature calculates that more than 80 percent of extractable coal reserves needs to stay in the ground to avoid warming Earth above preindustrial levels by more than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
\
So it makes sense for the so-called War on Coal to directly target supplies. For years, Nichols had little company on this battlefront. But a string of legal victories and the success of the anti-Keystone protests have encouraged bigger environmental groups and their supporters to join in. Others remain poised in the wings. The reinforcements broaden political support for the keep-it-in-theground movement. And it needs it: The raw hostility and fear I encountered at Craig's Popular Bar show that coal communities will not give up without a fight. The miners put a human face on the story, bolstering the fossil fuel industry's considerable financial and political heft.
\
Still, due at least in part to Nichols' doggedness, the Interior Department finally is grappling with the federal coal program and the way it hamstrings U.S. efforts to fight climate change. Says the Sierra Club's Nilles, ""What's exciting is there's new momentum in an area that has seemed intractable.""
\
NICHOLS, A LANKY MAN with a sparse beard and glasses, spoke to me in the brick ranch house he shares with his wife and two kids in Golden, Colorado. A native Westerner, from Boise, Idaho, he has long been passionate about preserving the region's wild landscapes, an ideal he inherited from his father, a Bureau of Land Management engineer. Nichols dropped out of the University of Wyoming in 2000 to become an activist and protect Wyoming's national forests from clear-cutting. Since then, he has moved from one environmental issue to another, pursuing each of his successively more ambitious goals with brash single-mindedness, another trait he inherited from his dad. One of his major successes was pushing the Environmental Protection Agency to write the first federal regulations for air pollution from natural gas drilling in 2012.
\
Despite his lack of formal education, Nichols has a keen grasp of environmental law and policy, which he picked up on the job after realizing how powerful federal laws can be if used aggressively. In recent years, Nichols has obsessively tracked government approval of new leases to mine fossil fuels and repeatedly sued over them.
\
In 2012, he learned about the proposed expansion of the West Elk Mine into the Sunset Roadless Area in western Colorado's North Fork Valley, coincidentally home to Paonia, High Country News' headquarters. The mine is underground, so the expansion itself would not have too much impact on the roadless area. But nearly all underground mines must vent naturally occurring methane for safety reasons, usually through wells drilled from the surface. That would require building roads into a scenic stretch of undeveloped national forest. And the coal in the North Fork is especially rich in methane, a potent greenhouse gas, which the mine expels in large amounts directly into the air.
\
""That was beyond offensive to see our federal government playing a role in letting that happen,"" Nichols says. ""To see this kind of industrial development happening here, it got us riled up.""
\
Nichols was scanning a preliminary environmental assessment of the proposal when he noticed something new, an analysis of the social costs of releasing the methane into the atmosphere during mining. (The analysis did not address greenhouse gas emissions from coal combustion.) But when the final version was published in 2013, that part had vanished. ""It set off our environmentalist radar,"" Nichols recalls.
\
In its place was the kind of language the BLM often used to rationalize the omission of climate impacts: ""Standardized protocols designed to measure factors that may contribute to climate change, and to quantify climatic impacts, are presently unavailable.""
\
WildEarth Guardians and other environmental groups sued to block the expansion, citing the disappearance of that greenhouse gas analysis, along with several legal issues. ""We were trying to throw everything at the wall to see what stuck,"" Nichols says. ""What stuck was climate."" U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson, the same judge who handled the Colowyo case, ruled in the environmental groups' favor. His decision hinged on the disappearance of the social cost of carbon analysis. It was ""arbitrary and capricious to quantify the benefits of the lease modifications and then explain that a similar analysis of the costs was impossible when such an analysis was in fact possible and was included in an earlier draft EIS,"" Jackson's ruling states.
\
No one was more flabbergasted by the government's decision to omit that analysis than the BLM economist who prepared it, David Epstein. ""That was extremely frustrating to see the final analysis pulled,"" says Epstein, who spoke on the record about this for the first time with High Country News. Epstein left the BLM last year, discouraged by his inability to effect change from the inside. Jackson's ruling refers to Epstein by name, but until I brought the ruling to his attention, Epstein was unaware of his cameo role in the epic struggle over the coal program's future.
\
Epstein's experience reflects a larger reality: Without clear guidance from Washington, BLM officials have handled coal's climate impacts in a helter-skelter fashion. Epstein's analysis focused on the greenhouse gas emissions released at West Elk, in order to obtain an estimate of the economic ccMipfiduihpihgzhiéthHntry ane into the atmosphere. Methane is the main component of natural gas. ""As an economist, it almost personally irks me that there's a valuable commodity or resource that's being wasted, because that's what happens when you're releasing it into the environment,"" he says.
\
Epstein, who at the time worked for the BLM's Colorado office in Golden, remembers acting on his own without encouragement or criticism from his bosses. But both the coal industry and environmentalists saw his draft as groundbreaking and sent in hundreds of comments, either objecting to it, supporting it or arguing that it failed to go far enough. West Elk's lawyer - apparently hoping to show how preposterous calculating the costs of emissions from coal extraction would be - argued that if the BLM was going to estimate the costs of methane emissions, it also should count the costs of all the carbon that would be released when electricity was generated from that coal - a very large number.
\
Epstein doesn't know who yanked his analysis from the final draft, or why. As for the boilerplate language that replaced it, Epstein says, ""It is illogical at best and possibly dishonest to persist in using that analysis."" He says BLM leaders were reluctant to move beyond business as usual, despite the fact that Obama, their boss, had set ambitious goals for reducing emissions, particularly methane. ""I don't know how to square those two points,"" Epstein says.
\
He left government feeling ineffectual. But his analysis empowered Nichols, giving him the hook for his first big legal victory in the effort to reform the federal coal program. Says Nichols, ""That somebody within the agency was honest and willing to put their integrity first like that was huge.""
\
THE COAL-FIRED POWER PLANT pictured on Craig's welcome sign shows how central coal is to the identity of this town of 9,000 in the state's northwest corner. Craig was hardly a dot on the map when the big surface mines started pulling millions of tons of federal coal out of the ground; first Trapper in 1954, then Colowyo in 1978. A large underground mine, Peabody's Twentymile, opened nearby in 1983. The mines feed Craig Power Station and the smaller Hayden Generating Station, and ship coal as far away as Florida.
\
Colowyo, 26 miles south of Craig, is central to the area's long romance with the federal coal program. Mine manager Chris McCourt drives me to the edge of the enormous pit, 1,000 acres across and 450 feet deep. Glistening black coal lies in bands between layers of gray rock. From up here, the steady stream of coalhauling vehicles look like tiny matchbox trucks. But the tires alone are twice as tall as I am. Each truck carries 200 or more tons of coal.
\
The mine's coal provides enough electricity to supply more than a half million N homes. Colowyo and other local mines together employ about 1,000 people, and the power plants another 570, according to the Economic Development Council of Colorado. Many other jobs in the region depend at least partly on the industry. Tri-State, Colowyo's owner, pays about $12 million in federal royalties and local and state taxes each year.
\
For several months this year, that all seemed imperiled by Nichols' most significant triumph yet. In May, Judge Jackson gave the Interior Department 120 days to rectify its failure to analyze not just the emissions from the mining, but also the impacts of the greenhouse gases and other pollution that would be caused by burning its coal. Without such an analysis, the mine would be forced to shut down.
\
It was a big victory for Nichols, but one that revealed a major obstacle for the keep-it-in-the-ground campaign: The blunt economic blow its success would deal to mining communities. Pollutioncontrol efforts rarely cause such clear-cut economic harm, and in fact, sometimes do the opposite. Getting automakers to install catalytic converters in vehicles created an entirely new industry, and plenty of jobs. Cutting power plant emissions requires installing pollution-control devices, for example, or building a natural gas-fired unit to replace a coal-burning one. But shutting down a coal mine eliminates jobs directly, first in the mines and then all down the industrial chain that relies on the coal, from railroads to power plants. And that, in turn, makes the anticoal activists seem like insensitive foes of working-class people. Western communities are used to hardrock-mining and petroleum busts, but the coal reserves are so huge that those mining jobs had seemed permanent.
\
The judge's ruling stunned Craig. ""We were just flabbergasted,"" says Nick Davis, a lab technician at Colowyo. Davis, his wife and two sons had just moved from a singlewide trailer into their dream house when they heard about it. Now, he fears for his job. Davis knew that cheap natural gas and Obama's new air pollution regulations for coal-fired power plants were reducing demand for coal nationally. But he hoped that Colowyo, which has a long-term contract with Craig Power Station, would be immune. An EPA official came to town last fall and assured local people that coal would have a place under the Clean Power Plan, which gives states wide leeway to craft plans to reduce emissions - the agency projects that 27 percent of the nation's electricity still will come from coal in 2030, down from 39 percent in 2014. But the judge's ruling threw all that into doubt.
\
In July, even as Craig was reeling and its citizens garnering sympathy from the national media, Nichols was quoted as saying, ""My initial reaction is, 'Tough shit.' "" He says he was not dismissing the plight of the people of Craig, but rather referring to local politicians who criticized the Interior Department for not appealing the ruling. Still, the comment reinforced the notion that this was a battle between environmentalists who love nature more than humans, and an industry that has long provided stable, high-paying jobs to American workers.
\
Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet and Gov. John Hickenlooper, both Democrats, sided with the mineworkers, urging Interior Secretary Sally Jewell to do everything in her power to keep the mine open. The Office of Surface Mining went into overdrive to fulfill the judge's ruling and issue a new environmental assessment before a September deadline. The government concluded that burning Colowyo coal to generate electricity would release about 9 million metric tons of greenhouse gases a year. But it also said that would have an insignificant environmental impact, because that pollution would be a fraction of 1 percent of global emissions. Nichols may have raised the bar for environmental assessments, but the coal will keep coming out of the ground, and the carbon will keep going into the atmosphere.
\
Despite the reprieve, Craig remains on edge. ""What could be down the road? It's a scary time,"" says Davis.
\
AND IT MAY BE GETTING SCARIER. In a major energy address in March, Jewell promised to begin more thoroughly weighing the climate impacts of drilling and mining. ""Helping our nation cut carbon pollution,"" she said, ""should inform our decisions about where we develop, how we develop and what we develop."" This summer, she launched a national listening session on the future of the coal program, asking whether Americans should get more return for federal coal. But there's a bigger question as well: How do we manage our coal program in a way that is consistent with our climate change objectives?
\
Meanwhile, the Interior Department has repeatedly defended its coal program. This summer, it defeated a lawsuit aimed at making it assess the cumulative climate impacts of its coal program. Later, it prevailed against another suit that would have forced the government to quantify the climate costs of massive new leases at two Powder River Basin mines that are among the world's largest.
\
The administration's lack of resolve has created confusion for frontline officials at Interior and in the Forest Service. Jim Bedwell, director of recreation, lands and minerals for the Forest Service Rocky Mountain region, was charged with assessing the greenhouse gas impacts and social cost of carbon of the West Elk mine expansion following Nichols' successful lawsuit. Yet ""there's no uniform methodology"" for doing so, he says.
\
Bob Abbey, who headed the BLM from 2009 to 2012, says the White House Council on Environmental Quality has failed to provide clear guidance. In 2010 and again in 2014, the council released drafts on how all agencies should calculate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change when conducting environmental reviews, but the White House office has yet to produce a final document. In the meantime, each BLM field office improvises its own approach. This is true for oil and gas leases as well as coal. ""I think that has led to this inconsistency that is not beneficial to anyone,"" Abbey says.
\
Nichols has been relentless in highlighting that inconsistency. In a protest against 2015 oil and gas lease sales in Utah, he demonstrates just how differently various BLM offices treat fossil fuels and climate change. Despite the scientific consensus on the anthropogenic causes of recent global warming, some environmental assessments from Utah BLM offices insist there is uncertainty over emissions' impact on climate. In contrast, the BLM's Four Rivers Field Office in Boise made a detailed social cost of carbon calculation for five parcels being offered for lease in Idaho.
\
Current top officials at BLM and Interior declined to be interviewed on the record for this story. But, speaking on background, one Interior official acknowledges the problem and, like Abbey, blames the White House: ""It really has been confusing. There is no final guidance on this yet. We've been given the leeway to apply it, if and where it makes sense. But because there is no requirement to apply the social cost of carbon ... it's applied inconsistently or not at all.""
\
Some former senior Obama administration officials have advocated introducing new fees on federal coal: ""The price for taxpayer-owned coal should reflect, in some measure, the added costs associated with the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions,"" former Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes and Harvard University professor of economics James Stock, a former member of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, opined in The New York Times in March. In the June speech that launched her presidential campaign, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke of plans to charge new fees for fossil fuels, protect miners' pensions and create economic opportunities as coal jobs disappear.
\
Abbey suggests that the administration's failure to align the coal program with the president's climate agenda ultimately comes down to economics and politics: ""They can say all the right things in public relative to climate change and the need to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. They're also realizing those sources of energy are very, very important to our nation's treasury.""
\
Over the last 10 years, the federal coal program raised $12 billion in royalties and other payments. About half of that went to the states where the mines are located, where it is used for schools and other local priorities. Industry also sways policy: Coal companies spend millions backing candidates, primarily Republicans, in every election, peaking with $15 million in the 2012 election cycle, according to the Genien fot! Responsive! U ry Politics. They also spend millions more every year lobbying Congress - $17 million in 2012.
\
Early in the Obama administration, it looked like Congress might pass a cap-and-trade law to rein in greenhouse gas emissions nationwide. But Republicans nixed that when they took back the House in 2010. Obama vowed to use his executive authority instead. But court challenges and fervent congressional opposition threaten his biggest initiative, the Clean Power Plan. ""I will tell you this: The fossil fuel industry is very powerful in this nation and throughout the world,"" Abbey says. ""I think it's an indication that it's going to require a different type of leadership for us to get to where we need to be.""
\
IN AUGUST, THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT holds a listening session on the coal program in Gillette, the heart of the nation's biggest coalfield, the Powder River Basin. As a measure of how important federal coal is to Wyoming, the state's entire U.S. congressional delegation plus its governor gather in a local auditorium. Jeremy Nichols is here, too, deep in hostile territory, sitting about halfway back and listening intently.
\
At other listening sessions - in Montana, New Mexico, Colorado and Washington, D.C. - people have urged federal officials to raise royalty rates and give Americans their ""fair share"" from publicly owned coal, which they argue is underpriced. Companies pay 12.5 percent on what they sell out of the mine - the same percentage the government gets from oil and natural gas on federal land, and far lower than what most states receive for fossil fuels on state land. Critics charge that in too many cases the coal is sold first to affiliated middlemen, who resell or export it at higher prices, thus shortchanging the government and the taxpayers. New leases are often next to existing mines, so typically just one company bids, keeping the price low. Many advocate raising royalties enough to reflect the true toll of emissions, including worsening droughts, forest fires, natural disasters, flooding and heat waves - a price high enough to keep fuels in the ground.
\
But in Gillette, almost everyone passionately defends the coal program. One after another, politicians, miners, school officials and locals beg Interior not to increase royalty rates or otherwise curtail it. Nichols is one of the few environmentalists present. His mission is part outreach and part opposition research. He wants to understand coal communities so he can defuse the political backlash that threatens to thwart his objective. ""There are people behind what's happening here, not that we lose sight of that, but it's important (for me) to be exposed to that,"" he says. ""It helps us in trying to figure out how do we sell a keep-it-in-the-ground message in a way that acknowledges the N humanity that is affected. That's a challenge, and the only way you can do it is if you're genuine about actually listening to people.""
\
People like Penny Russell, 46, who drives a huge coal truck. ""The truly sad part is a large portion of us will lose everything for no valid reason,"" she says. Russell earns triple what she made in retail before starting at Cloud Peak's Cordero Rojo Mine a decade ago, enough to help her extended family. ""We don't want to be forced onto welfare in Gillette. We want to work and pay our way through life without asking for government assistance."" Nichols, however, remains unapologetic. He's motivated by his concern about the many ways global warming could disrupt the lives of his own children and everybody else's.
\
Outside, coal companies stage a rally in opposition to the Clean Power Plan, environmentalists' lawsuits and proposals to raise royalties. Richard Reavey, a vice president of Cloud Peak Energy, which mines federal coal in Wyoming, says the war on coal is about ""crybaby billionaires"" - major donors to environmentalist causes - getting Democratic politicians to protect their investments in renewable energy since they can't get Congress to pass a climate change law.
\
Although Nichols' battle began as a lonely effort, the broader environmental movement has started to join him. ""Over the last two years, you've got a lot of groups that have started to engage on the supply side of the climate fight,"" says Nathaniel Shoaff, a Sierra Club lawyer and occasional partner with Nichols in lawsuits against the federal coal program.
\
Microsoft-cofounder and philanthropist Paul Allen bankrolled a lawsuit in November 2014, challenging the Interior Department to assess the cumulative climate effects of the entire federal coal program. In late August, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia sided with the administration and dismissed the case. But the plaintiffs, Western Organization of Resource Councils and Friends of the Earth, filed an appeal.
\
In August, Nichols lost what was arguably his biggest case. WildEarth Guardians and the Sierra Club had challenged big lease sales at the Black Thunder and North Antelope Rochelle mines, both in Wyoming's Powder River Basin. The Obama administration argued that even such massive leases would have no significant impact on the climate, and the judge, a Reagan appointee, agreed. Meanwhile, the BLM's Buffalo field office authorized the leasing and mining of 10 billion tons of coal from the Powder River Basin over the next two decades without weighing the costs of the pollution that would result, or considering options that would keep some of that coal in the ground. BLM officials say their decisions are justified by their court wins and the importance of federal coal, especially to Wyoming, where it brings in several hundred million dollars in revenue a year, a large portion of the state budget. ""It's a very large monetary issue for the state of Wyoming,"" says Duane Spencer, who manages the BLM's Buffalo field office.
\
But Nichols remains undaunted. This fall, he and other groups won a case involving a large surface mine in Montana, when U.S. District Court Judge Dana L. Christensen ruled that Interior failed to consider environmental impacts when it OK'd mining. Nichols and the Sierra Club appealed the Wyoming ruling, and he's optimistic about an ongoing case in New Mexico. His group also challenged another mine expansion, this one in Utah, and filed a sweeping case targeting mines in Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico and accusing the federal government of violating the law by failing to consider their cumulative climate change impact. ""We're in the courtroom, we're scrapping it up and being adversarial,"" he says. He's convinced that if the federal government is forced to scrutinize the true environmental costs, it inevitably will conclude that mining the public's coal is not in the public interest.
\
That is unlikely under the current regime, however. Jewell told reporters this fall that the administration may rewrite rules to give Americans a bigger take from the coal program. But she won't add a price to federal coal to reflect climate change, nor will she keep federal fossil fuels in the ground. ""There are millions of jobs around the country that are dependent on these industries, and you can't just cut it off overnight and expect to have an economy that is in fact the leader in the world,"" Jewell said at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast in Washington. ""It oversimplifies a very complex situation to suggest one could simply cut off leasing or drilling on public lands and solve the issue of climate change.""
\
In late September, Nichols took a rare trip to Washington to rally with activists from Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, 350.org and other groups outside the White House. They delivered a letter for Obama, signed by scores of organizations, which called on him to keep federal fossil fuels on the ground.
\
I met Nichols in a park outside the Interior Department headquarters. He had just come from a meeting with senior Interior officials and was still wearing a suit. He said little about the meeting, but was clearly elated that his once-lonely crusade had attracted support and given him entrée into the halls of power in Washington. ""The Interior Department has finally acknowledged, OK, something needs to be fixed here,"" Nichols said. ""We have a window of opportunity to get something that's pretty big - something that puts the federal coal program on the path towards keeping it in the ground.""
"
26,"
That winter's day, as she headed to the White House, Gina McCarthy undoubtedly steeled herself for a confrontation. It was 2014, and McCarthy, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, was about to make her case for blocking the controversial Pebble gold mine planned for Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed, home to one of the world's * most prolific salmon fisheries. But she knew that the lawyers, economists and political advisors assembled in the Roosevelt Room would make Swiss cheese out of her plan. The decision would inflame the Republican Congress, they'd say, hamper economic growth and likely provoke a lawsuit from industry. Then they'd send her on her way without an answer.
\
But McCarthy also knew there would be a new player in the room. Longtime Democratic operative John Podesta, Bill Clinton's former chief of staff, had just returned to the White House as counselor to Barack Obama. And Podesta had a reputation for bold conservation policy.
\
Shortly before the meeting, in fact, Podesta pulled aside Mike Boots, the acting head of the White House's Council on Environmental Quality. He said: ""Maybe it's time for me to show people it's going to be different,"" Boots recalled.
\
And 10 minutes into the conversation, Podesta broke in. He said that he and the president endorsed McCarthy's plan, and then laid out exactly how the announcement would roll out. McCarthy left the room, dumbfounded and elated. ""Was that the Roosevelt Room that I was just in?"" she asked, according to a White House staffer, who asked to remain anonymous. ""I've only ever been handed my ass in that room.""
\
The Pebble Mine decision was just the start of a yearlong presidential sprint to advance conservation and climate change goals. Podesta has been there every step of the way. Think of him as the Good Witch in The Wizard ofOz, telling Obama's Dorothy that she always had the power to do what she wanted; she simply had to tap her heels together three times.
\
As the 66-year-old Podesta embarks on yet another adventure - this time as Hillary Clinton's campaign manager for the 2616 ejection - he can list some remarkable acj'ievemenbs: He directly had a hand in six of 16 national monuments Obama has created or expanded so far by executive order, including New Mexico's Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks, Colorado's Browns Canyon, Southern California's San Gabriel Mountains, and the country's largest marine reserve, the Pacific Remote Islands National Monument; and steered a landmark climate deal with China to control greenhouse gas, as well as the first proposal to regulate climate emissions from U.S. coal-fired power plants.
\
Add in his record under Bill Clinton - the sweeping 2001 ""Roadless Rule"" protecting 58 million acres administered by the U.S. Forest Service, and the 19 national monuments and conservation areas, many in the West, that Clinton declared in his second term in office - and Podesta can claim a green legacy that even Teddy Roosevelt would be proud of.
\
""Nobody in the 21st century in U.S. government has had the influence that he has had on public lands and climate change,"" says Douglas Brinkley, a Rice University professor of history.
\
Podesta rarely gets public credit, but those who do - from the presidents he has served to Cabinet members and agency heads - are quick to acknowledge his contributions.
\
Says Bruce Babbitt, Clinton's Interior secretary, ""The hidden hand of John Podesta is involved in every environmental advancement accomplished in the Clinton and Obama administrations.""
\
AND YET, JOHN PODESTA RARELY talks about how an inside Washington guy like him became an environmental crusader. His office at the Center for American Progress, the think tank he created in 2003, is small, and the pictures on the walls aren't the serious images you'd expect - photos of him standing with a president on the edge of some majestic canyon somewhere. Rather, they show him engaged in various antics at the White House - riding in the cherry-picker of a hybrid-electric utility truck over the West Wing, for example, or floating over the White House lawn in a helium balloon.
\
""I was standing in the Oval Office with Clinton and I could see them testing the balloon, and I said, 'Mr. President, I've got to make sure this thing is going right,' "" Podesta says, laughing. ""Of course, the president wanted to do it, too, and the Secret Service said, 'No way are we letting you go up in a balloon above the White House.' ""
\
Podesta has a quirky sense of humor and is famously fascinated by science fiction - especially UFOs. One of his last tweets before leaving the White House this year was: ""Biggest failure: Once again not securing the #disclosure of the UFO files."" Even people who've worked with him for years aren't sure how serious he is about this particular obsession. ""He wants it that way,"" says Ana Unruh Cohen of the Center for American Progress, a longtime colleague.
\
The roots of Podesta's passion for the environment are equally murky to many who have worked with him. Why does he care so much about this issue?
\
""It's not from my upbringing,"" he replies with a smile. ""I spent most of my time standing on street corners."" Podesta's parents both worked in factories when he was growing up in Chicago. More seriously, he adds, ""I have two grandchildren, hopefully more. It comes a little bit from, I'm kind of a Pope Francis Catholic: I'm someone who just cares about the future.""
\
Podesta says he fell in love with wild places during college-break visits to the Colorado Rocky Mountains in the 1960s. Now he and his wife of 36 years, Mary, a retired lawyer, own a vacation house in Truckee, California.
\
""My wife and I took up cross-country skiing as geezers, and I'm a fanatic snowshoer,"" says Podesta. He has the ultralean frame of a long-distance runner, his clothes floating around him as if they're still on a hanger.
\
Podesta's political philosophy was shaped by his time at Knox College, a small liberal arts school in Galesburg, Illinois, where he joined Vietnam War protests and civil rights demonstrations. His first major political experience involved working on the doomed 1972 presidential campaign of liberal Democrat George McGovern. In 1976, he earned a law degree from Georgetown University. It wasn't until 1990 that his passion for the environment really caught fire, though, when he worked on that year's Earth Day celebration.
\
Podesta and his brother, lobbyist Tony Podesta, organized a Washington, D.C., event from the basement of a townhouse on Capitol Hill. It drew hundreds of thousands of people to the National Mall, including celebrities like Tom Cruise, John Denver and Olivia Newton-John.
\
""It was a life-transforming experience,"" recalls Tony Podesta.
\
An ""Earth Day 1990"" poster adorned John Podesta's various offices at the White House, yet Podesta has trouble articulating what drives his own environmentalism. 'You ask me, ""What's my commitment?' "" he says. ""It's kind of like when wandering around in the Rocky Mountains - you never forget it. You become connected to it. Wallace Stegner described it as the geography of hope.""
\
IT'S NOT SURPRISING that Podesta answers by quoting someone else; after all, he's spent much of his career talking about what his bosses believe. But while words might elude him, actions don't. His effectiveness as a White House insider, honed during the Clinton years, is unrivaled. Not surprisingly, he's attracted critics. Some allege conflicts of interest with wealthy donors or accuse him of overusing executive powers. Others say that his policies are not green enough.
\
His colleagues defend his motives and point to his accomplishments, crediting his uncanny political skill. ""In politics, some people are out there playing checkers. Some people are playing chess. And he's playing three-dimensional chess,"" says Carol Browner, who headed Clinton's Environmental Protection Agency and was the White House ""climate czar"" during Obama's first term.
\
Browner vividly remembers how the playing field shifted when Podesta became Clinton's chief of staff in 1998. Over the Fourth of July in 2000, Browner says, she went camping with her family. A park ranger came to their campsite. ""He says, 'We're looking for Carol Browner. There are these people (on the phone - this is before cellphones were standard gear). They say it's the White House.' ""
\
It was Podesta, who had called to warn her: Congress had launched a stealth attack on her agency's upcoming rule to regulate the amount of pollution in the nation's waterways, known as the ynTotal Maximum Dâily Load. At the last minute, an unidentified legislator inserted a measure into an emergency spending bill to prevent the EPA from spending any money on the new rule.
\
Browner replied: 'You have to veto this. This is outrageous."" Podesta said the president had to sign the spending bill - it funded crucial disaster relief - so they had to find another way. And so, while the president used his 10-day cushion to delay signing, EPA staffers worked around the clock to finish the new rule, months ahead of schedule. In the end, the rider had no impact because the rule was already in place.
\
Other Cabinet members benefitted from Podesta's knowledge and influence. And Podesta learned as well. Interior Secretary Babbitt worked with him to create a series of new national monuments, mostly on underappreciated Bureau of Land Management holdings in the West. Wielding the 1906 Antiquities Act to get around Congress, Clinton first designated the 1.9 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah months before the 1996 election. The move provoked loud protests from locals and their elected officials, who denounced it as a federal land grab and complained they were never consulted.
\
That experience taught Babbitt to use the Antiquities Act more carefully. ""Everybody from the administration is still quite proud of having designated Escalante,"" Podesta says. But ""Secretary Babbitt came away from that saying, we shouldn't spring this on people. We should spend more time, listen more thoughtfully.""
\
Podesta never forgot. In early 2014, when a group of Western senators, frustrated by the lack of progress in preserving public lands, invited Podesta to Capitol Hill, he first asked if they had public support for their proposal. New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich cited a broad coalition of local residents, who had spent decades trying to get Congress to protect a rough-and-tumble chunk of mountains, canyons and grasslands outside Las Cruces as a wilderness area. Would the president consider creating a national monument there now?
\
Some Cabinet members hesitated, unwilling to promote new monuments that were guaranteed to anger the powerful Republicans who controlled the federal budget.
\
""The secretaries knew they were in for it with their congressional overseers,"" says Podesta, ""and I think they weren't certain about whether the president would back them up. I tried to reassure them that indeed he would.""
\
Within a few months, President Obama had designated the half-millionacre Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument. Sen. Heinrich gives Podesta credit for getting ""the wheels turning within the White House"" to make it happen. ""He personally gets these issues and he understands the West and he understands the importance of lands issues,"" Heinrich says.
\
Podesta also understands how public lands can be leveraged to benefit his boss and political party. Toward the end of the Clinton administration, he supported Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck's proposal to permanently protect the remaining roadless areas on national forests from logging, mining, drilling and other development. He saw it as another piece of Clinton's environmental legacy. Dombeck, who had previously had little influence in the White House, suddenly found himself attending meetings in the West Wing, with Clinton himself popping in to check on progress.
\
Podesta was deeply interested in the details, Dombeck recalls, and drove the decision to add forest lands excluded from the original proposal, including the Tongass in Alaska, the Black Hills in western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming, and the Pacific Northwest forests where the northern spotted owl lives. The plan topped out at 58.5 million acres, more than a quarter of all the national forest lands. Podesta maneuvered the proposal through a gantlet of other agencies and the White House Office of Management and Budget in the weeks before George W. Bush moved into the White House. It was signed just a week before Clinton left office.
\
""We'd have never gotten it done without him,"" says Dombeck.
\
How does Podesta get such controversial conservation initiatives past the finish line? ""It's just good management,"" he says. ""If you want to get something done, you pay attention to it.""
\
Colleagues say Podesta's generally an affable and supportive manager. But as the point man for the many scandals that plagued the Clinton White House, he got a reputation for having an evil twin known as ""Skippy,"" who could be harsh and unusually direct. ""I've had some Skippy sightings, (but) not in a while,"" says David Hayes, who was deputy secretary of the Interior Department for both Clinton and Obama. By 2007, when Daniel Weiss joined the Center for American Progress, he says Skippy ""was more legend than fact."" That's not to say Podesta's not still very exacting. ""He's very committed to his friends,"" Carol Browner says. But ""it doesn't mean he's not a hard-ass sometimes. He calls it as he sees it.""
\
WHEN THE REPUBLICANS TOOK OVER the
\
White House in 2001, Podesta and some colleagues decided to create a progressive think tank that would be tough enough to compete with those on the political right. They called it the Center for American Progress, and it grew into a revolving-door powerhouse that harnessed the intellectual and political capital of the academic, NGO, philanthropic and government communities, often shuttling people in and out of key positions in all these realms. In 2012, the group had a budget of more than $39 million, according to its 1RS 990, and today, it boasts a staff of 314 policy wonks, professors and writers.
\
""Democrats and progressives did not have an institution dedicated to thinking up policies and finding a way to move them into the public sphere,"" says Ana Unruh Cohen, who joined the think tank in 2004 as its first director of environmental policy. ""We called it a think-and-do tank. We didn't want to write just one more report that would be sitting on the shelf.""
\
Perhaps the center's most urgent environmental goal was developing climate policies and building political and public support for them. The entire environmental movement had watched as AI Gore, heeding his advisors, retreated from his fierce concern about climate change during his unsuccessful presidential bid in 2000. The think tank believed that, with more groundwork, climate policy could become a winning political issue.
\
Part of the groundwork included working with Republicans and business leaders. In 2005, Podesta teamed up with think tanks in Great Britain and Australia to create the International Climate Change Task Force. He believed the major economies could work together to combat runaway climate change. Maine Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe, who has since retired from the Senate, led the task force with a British member of parliament, and by the end of 2007, President George W. Bush had adopted a similar, though watered-down, approach, launching a voluntary effort by major economies to slow and stop the growth of greenhouse gases. He also asked Congress to tighten fuel economy standards for cars.
\
Podesta's Center for American Progress lobbied Congress to do the same, commissioning a poll that showed public support for boosting fuel economy. Daniel Weiss, who worked for the center at the time, says the poll helped persuade House Democrats to vote for the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, which required automakers to raise fuel economy standards to 35 miles per gallon by the model year 2020. President Bush signed the bill into law.
\
As the 2008 election approached, Podesta continued to think and act like the chief of staff of a Democratic White House in waiting. With Todd Stern, his thinktank colleague, he released a clean energy blueprint for the next administration. Although Podesta supported Hillary Clinton in the primaries, Obama embraced clean energy as a centerpiece of his campaign, and long before it was clear whether he would win, he asked Podesta to lead his transition team. Despite a multitude of competing priorities - including selecting a Cabinet and White House staff- Podesta continued to press conservation measures. In TV appearances, he urged the cancellation of 77 oil and gas leases near Canyonlands and Arches national parks in Utah, an idea Interior Secretary Ken Salazar eventually implemented. He also readied an economic recovery bill that invested $90 billion in renewable energy and energy efficiency, including programs like ""cash for clunkers,"" which paid people to trade in old gas-guzzterd.i Mànÿiôf the i try initiatives came straight from the Center for American Progress.
\
Podesta returned to his think tank, but many of his allies remained in the administration. Stern became a special envoy for climate change at the State Department. Former senior fellow Denis McDonough rose through the White House inner circle to become chief of staff in 2013. Jennifer Palmieri went from president of the center's political arm to assistant to the president and White House communications director. She's now communications director for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Christina Goldfuss moved from publiclands director at the Center for American Progress to deputy director of the National Park Service. Today, she's acting chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. The list goes on.
\
The think tank's revolving door positioned Podesta and his allies to promote action on climate change early in the Obama administration. Ana Unruh Cohen left the center and re-joined the staff of Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., where she helped draft sweeping legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Democratic majority in both chambers offered a rare window in which to push for the bill, which included a market-based strategy for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, known as cap and trade.
\
The climate bill passed the House in 2009, but Senate Republicans used the recession to successfully paint the bill as a jobs killer, and even some Democrats helped kill it. It was a major defeat for Obama and Podesta, and, for a while, Obama retreated on the environment.
\
BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE a second term facing a Congress fully in the hands of the opposing party to change a president's perspective.
\
""With an obstructionist Congress, you ... need to think about, 'How do I use all the authority of the bully pulpit, publicprivate partnerships, executive authority, regulatory authority to try to make the country a better place?' "" Podesta says.
\
Although not officially part of the White House, Podesta was never far away, visiting 139 times between 2009 and the end of 2013, according to the White House visitor log. Podesta wasn't always a cheerleader; he urged the White House to do more on income inequality, clean energy and climate, and he joined Babbitt in criticizing the Obama administration for drilling more public land than it had protected.
\
With Podesta's input from the sidelines, Obama began using the Antiquities Act to designate monuments. The president issued executive orders to get agencies to consider climate change impacts and announced regulations to curb greenhouse gases. After he announced his Climate Action Plan, Obama brought Podesta back formally as a senior advisor to implement it, ""both in substance and communication,"" Boots says.
\
Podesta immediately saw a chance to make a splash with the National Climate Assessment, due out in May 2014. He knew a data-filled 827-page climate report would make most people's eyes glaze over, so he found a way to jazz it up by championing a colleague's idea to bring meteorologists to the White House lawn, and persuaded the president to do one-on-one interviews with national and local TV weather forecasters, says Boots. ""These are people who have huge audiences every morning, who are trusted, who could talk about changes.""
\
Successful events like this helped embolden Obama, but failed to impress everyone in the environmental community. The administration's initial reluctance to aggressively regulate hydraulic fracturing and greenhouse gas emissions from the natural gas industry angered on-theground activists. At a White House conference table in March 2014, a reporter's question about environmentalists' call for a ban on exports of natural gas provoked a sharp response. Opposing all fossil fuels, Podesta snapped, is a ""completely impractical way of moving towards a clean energy future.""
\
Liberal pundits and mainstream journalists have occasionally questioned Podesta about his think tank's financial and policy ties to its energy, defense and pharmaceutical company funders. But his most aggressive critics are on the 4ewright. Following Podesta's return to the White House, right-wing bloggers and reporters honed in on one of the center's board members and major donors, HansjörgWyss, a billionaire businessman who, for two decades, has financed efforts to conserve public lands. Podesta's financial White House disclosure showed he collected $87,000 in 2013, for consulting for the HJW Foundation, a Wyss philanthropy. The conservative Daily Caller website accused Podesta of violating White House ethics rules for taking funds from Wyss and then pushing Obama's proposal to expand the area off-limits to oil and gas drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge - a priority for the Wyss Foundation.
\
Nothing ever came of the accusations. A spokesperson for Podesta said: ""While Mr. Wyss and Mr. Podesta share a passion for conserving America's most precious landscapes, his consulting work involved a separate philanthropy focused on social justice issues. He observed all applicable rules, and there was no conflict.""
\
Together, HJW and Wyss Foundation donated more than $5 million to the Center for American Progress between 2011 and 2013, according to a spokesman for the Wyss Foundation. The foundations merged in 2014. (High Country News has received donations from the Wyss Foundation, including funding for news coverage from Washington, D.C.)
\
Tony Podesta brushes off the criticism. ""He agrees with those views, is an effective advocate, and they (philanthropic donors) fund his research on issues they care about,"" he says. ""That's how the nonprofit sector works; that's how think tanks work."" Then, referring to another, more famous pair of brothers, the fossil fuel industry billionaires who fund GOP campaigns, he adds: ""Did you expect the Koch brothers would fund John to stop drilling"" in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge?
\
PODESTA'S MOST IMPORTANT contribution during his year in the White House may have been his role in negotiating a climate agreement between the United States and China - the world's two greatest emitters of greenhouse gases. Drawing on long-term relationships with Chinese leaders and experts, Podesta entered negotiations with a well-conceived plan. One key to getting China to agree to a robust pledge, he says, was showing that the U.S. was taking serious action on its own: The EPA's proposal to cut greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants, along with policies to reduce climate pollution from cars and expand solar and wind power, demonstrated that ""we were doing a lot,"" he says.
\
Podesta hopes the deal will lead to a new international climate agreement, and a political shift in Congress. ""I think it had the ancillary effect of taking off the table the argument that we shouldn't do anything because the Chinese aren't doing anything, when the Chinese are in fact doing quite a lot to transform their energy system,"" he says.
\
That's not to say that Podesta expects Republican climate skeptics to concede defeat. In fact, he seems to hope climate change will be a central issue in the 2016 election, which could pit a Republican climate denier against Hillary Clinton, with Podesta in her corner. Many of his tweets since he officially became Clinton's campaign chairman have pressed the issue: He praises California's aggressive new climate goals, warns of alarming new science on melting Antarctic ice, posts a video of President Obama losing his normal cool at climate deniers during a skit at the White House Correspondents Dinner, and shares a photo showing a polar bear cub stretching to nuzzle its mother in Alaska, where the animals are threatened by melting sea ice.
\
One tweet hints at how Podesta sees the battle possibly shaping up. He links to a Guardian story that quotes GOP candidate Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas comparing people who believe in global warming to ""the flat-Earthers,"" even as a recent poll shows that 60 percent of Republicans believe the government should limit greenhouse gases. ""If the majority of Rs support climate action,"" he wonders, ""when will their leaders accept the science?""
\
Back in his office, Podesta can't hide his eagerness for the fight ahead: ""Politics is about friction. When people agree more than they disagree, it doesn't rise to the top. This time it could be massive."" ?

27,"On a gravel lot next to Radiological Imaging Technology's office building on List Drive, workers are placing the last of 683 solar panels onto steel frames. On a sunny day, the completed array will produce 147 kilowatts of electricity - the largest private solar-power system in the city.\For Dan Ritt, RIT's founder and president, the panels are a gamble, a billboard, a point of pride and an investment. That last point is comparatively new territory for solar power, long the province of hard-core environmentalists and far-flung homes off the electrical grid.\But rapidly falling prices for solar panels and equipment, coupled with generous subsidies from federal, state and local governments, are making solar power an intriguing option for businesses and homeowners looking to hedge their power costs.\""The return on investment for Phase 1 (the first 312 panels) was five years,"" Ritt said. ""You'd be hard-pressed to find another investment like that."" \Since the first panels went up in July 2009, RIT's typical electric bill of $700-$800 a month has all but vanished, Ritt said.\When he bought the land for his company's offices\three years ago, he planned to put up a two-story warehouse and office on the lot next to the main building.\Then a friend in Los Angeles told him about the booming demand for rooftop solar arrays in that city and it got Ritt thinking.\""If you think about (solar) as a business, it's a wonderful business,"" he said. ""There's no employees, there's no upkeep. All you have to do is pray for sunshine."" \Last year, John Hughes, president of O?Briens Carpet One on Garden of the Gods Road, was talking with his friend Craig Whitney, owner of Whitney Electric, about the falling prices and rebates available on solar.\""What it all boils down to,"" Whitney said, ""is it's a pretty good deal if the rebates are there."" \Hughes took the numbers to his accountant. ""He felt it was a no-brainer that we do this,"" Hughes said.\By December, 25,000 watts of solar panels sat on top of the 10,000-square-foot Carpet One building. The array cost a whopping $175,000, but Hughes received a $3.75 per watt ($93,750) rebate from Colorado Springs Utilities, plus a 30 percent federal tax credit and an accelerated depreciation schedule for the system.\""When it's all over and done with, it's going to be pretty low out-of-pocket,"" Hughes said. ""I think we should have, within a 3- to 5-year period, total return on investment."" \John Crandall, owner of the Old Town Bike Shop on South Tejon Street, was the first business owner to take advantage of Utilities? rebate program, back in 2007. A difficult installation drove up the project's costs to $59,000 for a 4,200-watt system, or $14 a watt. Even so, Crandall said he'd do it again today.\""Even in our worst case, a 20-year-payback, that's a 4 percent return on investment,"" he said. ""Even at that, it's one of the best places you can put your money."" \Take away the rebates and credits, however, and the economics of solar power get cloudy quickly.\The rebates spur investment in solar technology, which drives down prices and, eventually, makes further rebates unnecessary, said Mona Newton, central regional representative for the Governor's Energy Office.\""You have to stimulate the market, you have to bring the price more into parity with standard electricity,"" she said.\That strategy has had some success. A 2009 study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that installed costs of solar power have fallen by more than $3 a watt in the past 10 years, dropping from $10.80 per watt in 1998 to $7.50 per watt in 2008, before any rebates are taken into account. In Germany and Japan, which have very generous rebate programs, the average cost is less than $7 a watt, the study found.\At RIT, Ritt said the cost of solar panels fell 15 percent just since July 2009, when the first panels were installed, and March of this year, when the second set went in.\""I think early on, it was primarily people interested in the environmental or the political aspects of it,"" said Lotus (who goes by one name), president of Rocky Mountain Solar and Wind, which installed the RIT system. ""As time has gone on, they've been looking at the economics more because prices have come down so much."" \That's still, however, a long way from making solar as affordable as conventional power sources, particularly in Colorado, where much of our power comes from cheap coal. In Hawaii, solar power is already approaching ""grid parity? in price, and it can compete with peak demand pricing in parts of California.\Solar manufacturers say they'll have to hit $1 a watt to be broadly competitive with existing power sources. Several solar-power companies in Colorado are pursuing thin-film technology that, they say, can meet that price.\Dave Grossman, a spokesman for Colorado Springs Utilities, said conserving electricity through energy-efficient lighting, appliances and insulation is far cheaper than generating additional power through solar panels.\""More energy savings are achieved from efficiency rebates than from solar-energy installations,"" Grossman said. ""Efficiency upgrades are more affordable for customers, have a far better payback and can actually do more to protect the environment, dollar for dollar, than PV (photovoltaic) systems."" \Nevertheless, Colorado Springs Utilities has increased the size of its solar rebate program every year, from $170,000 in 2006 to $818,804 in 2009. (The program dipped to $672,100 in 2010, but Utilities is hoping to get another $300,000 from a state grant to add to the pool this year.)\Grossman said Utilities wants to support alternative-energy sources and meet its customers? interest in installing solar power while also supporting those less-flashy energy-efficiency programs. While the size of the pot has grown, Utilities? rebate per-watt for solar power has dropped every year as solar panels get cheaper, from $4 a watt in 2006 to $3 a watt in 2010.\Rebates have their detractors. Jon Caldara, president of the free-market Independence Institute in Golden, said rebates distort the market and waste money.\""I have nothing against feel-good, warm-and-fuzzy power as long as there is no subsidy for it,"" he said. ""You can call it the ""new energy economy,"" but really all it is is good old-fashioned political back scratching? corporate welfare with a happier face."" \A bill signed by Gov. Bill Ritter earlier this month requires that Xcel Energy and other producers generate 30?percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020 (CSU has to generate only 10 percent of its power from renewables by 2020), which will cause costs to soar, Caldara argues. ""Solar is outrageously expensive,"" he said. ""None of it is affordable without subsidies."" \Another way solar power could compete with coal and natural gas is if the government implemented a carbon cap aimed at reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, which is believed to contribute to global warming. A carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system, such as the U.S. Senate is considering, would drive up the price of fossil fuels and make carbon-neutral power sources like solar and wind look a lot better.\That's what Ritt is betting on to make the second phase of his array pay off. After using CSU's rebate in 2009, the second half of his array wasn't eligible for further rebates (although it's still eligible for the federal tax credit). Instead, Ritt struck a deal with CSU in which he gets to keep the renewable energy certificates generated by his solar panels. These certificates, or RECs, can be bought by companies needing to offset their carbon emissions. They aren't worth much at the moment, but a carbon cap could turn them into green gold.\""The way the world is going, I really think there's going to be carbon pricing,"" Ritt said. ""There's already a market (for RECs) in Europe."" \In the meantime, CSU pays Ritt and other solar owners a wholesale price (equal to half of the retail price) for any power they generate beyond their own use.\Nor do the benefits come solely on the utility bill. RIT's customers come from hospitals in 38 countries, Ritt said, and those customers like to see RIT's commitment to renewable energy.\""They're excited to see this and happy to see this,"" Ritt said. ""It really has helped us."" \Old Town Bike Shop's Crandall and O?Briens Carpet One's Hughes agreed that the panels are great billboards, attracting interest and customers.\It doesn't come with a price tag attached, but the final piece of the solar puzzle is that, for people who believe in the technology, installing a system makes them feel like they're doing their part to make the world a better place.\""Worst-case, I'm doing something incredible for the environment,"" Ritt said. ""We've all got to do our part. I feel fortunate I've been able to do something here."" \Call the writer at 636-0275.\Credit: ANDREW WINEKE awineke@gazette.com"
28,"
One hundred and fifty miles east of the city of Los Angeles, the Mojave and Colorado deserts converge in towering granite rock formations and strange succulent plants Joshua trees raising their arms to heaven like ancient prophets. From Interstate 10, everything looks brown and barren, but oases of spring-fed green hide a little ways in, with just enough water to sustain several hundred species of birds, lizards, bugs, bobcats, desert tortoise and a ragged herd of peninsular bighorn sheep.
\
Austin Puglisi had planned to build his dream home here. Not your typical desert dream home, the one with the high fence to protect it from wind and the irrigated lawn to mimic the lush Midwest. Puglisi wanted to build a tiny shack and set the rest of his 54-acre parcel aside for wildlife. He would use only local water and recycle it into the aquifer. He would get off the grid and live far from its influence.
\
So it came as a shock, one day last winter, when Puglisi discovered that the grid was coming to him.
\
On federal land just a few yards from the boundary of his property, Puglisi spotted a bright orange stake marking the spot where a metal disk had been anchored in the ground with concrete. Engraved on the disk were the words, ""Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.""
\
""From what I could tell,"" says the 47-year-old Puglisi, ""it looked like some kind of utility project was either going right through my land or on the ridge right above it.""
\
Puglisi was flabbergasted. ""We had just secured our building permit,"" he says. ""We had put in our solar-powered well. Now it looks like we have to put the whole thing on hold.""
\
His neighbors were finding similar clues in other places. Unfamiliar trucks were lumbering across the Kickapoo Trail through the Big Morongo Canyon Preserve; helicopters were landing on the boundaries of birdwatchers' desert hideaways. The men who emerged from the trucks and helicopters cheerfully identified themselves as surveyors for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and handed out fliers detailing plans for their brand-new renewable electricity transmission project, the Green Path North.
\
In some circles, this was awfully good news. The LADWP had begun planning the Green Path North three years ago, in part to access carbon-free, always-on power from geothermal fields in the Imperial Valley near the Saltón Sea, 180 miles away. The utility appeared to be moving ahead aggressively on renewable-energy transmission - and that meant it might soon deliver on its long-stalled promise to bring green power to its 4 million customers, who currently rely on coal burned out of state for close to half their electricity.
\
""The LADWP wants to be a leader in the field of renewable energy,"" affirmed the utility's new general manager and CEO, H. David Nahai, shortly after he moved from the utility's board of commissioners to its executive branch in December. And a significant piece of that effort, he said, will be ""building the transmission to bring it home.""
\
But for Puglisi, who also volunteers with several desert conservancies, the markers signaled a new threat to a landscape that local environmentalists had long worked to preserve. Small nonprofits like The Wildlands Conservancy and the Mojave Desert Land Trust have spent years cobbling together private and public funds to buy up hundreds of thousands of acres of the Mojave, preserving them for marginal species like the fringe-toed lizard and the endangered peninsular bighorn sheep. If the survey markers indicated anything, it was that 85 miles of 160-foot-tall steel towers, occupying a footprint 330 feet wide and buzzing with 500 kilovolt wires, would soon be cutting across the path those sheep use to get to their only source of summer water.
\
Worried calls to the utility invariably met with the same response: No route had been decided upon, and any discussion with the community over the transmission project would be premature. The utility confirms only that the Green Path North has to extend south from the desert town of Hesperia to a substation near Palm Springs, where it will link up with existing transmission to the Salton Sea and Arizona's Palo Verde nuclear plant. It could do that via any of six different routes, including one down the Interstate 10 freeway corridor, which would expand a right of way owned by another California utility, Southern California Edison, and require the condemnation of 3,500 properties.
\
By the time of Puglisi's discovery in late 2007, however, the LADWP had already submitted an application to the Bureau of Land Management for a right of way following the markers through the Big Morongo Preserve. A few months later, it petitioned the federal Department of Energy to include that route in the West-Wide Energy Corridor (WWEC), a process set forth by Congress in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to fold hundreds of energytransportation projects into a single environmental review. The way it looked to Puglisi, the L.A. Department of Water and Power - the same agency that 85 years ago built an aqueduct to suck the Owens River Valley dry - was setting up for another desert land grab. ""Los Angeles,"" Puglisi observes, ""doesn't give out very much information.""
\
More to the point, Los Angeles is in a hurry. The city needs to meet the renewable energy goals imposed by its greenminded mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, who wants 20 percent of the city's power to come from renewable sources by 2010, and 35 percent by 2020. And it also has to catch up with the rest of California. None of the state's other utilities, from the investorowned Southern California Edison to the public Sacramento Municipal Utility District, emit anywhere near the 13 million metric tons of carbon dioxide that LADWP does every year. And while the public utility was previously exempt from a state antiglobal warming law, it may soon be subject to a statewide cap-and-trade system taxing all greenhouse gas emitters, public and private.
\
So the LADWP, which currently derives only eight percent of its energy from renewable sources - up from three percent in 2006 - has had to scramble to find green power. And the Mojave has long been a natural place to look.
\
""The wasteland of the desert is the goldmine of our future energy needs,"" writes the octogenarian energy expert S. David Freeman in his book, Winning Our Energy Independence. Freeman, who helped guide energy policy under both the Nixon and Carter administrations, ran the L.A. Department of Water and Power from 1997 to 2001. He wears cowboy hats and speaks in a Tennessean's exaggerated drawl, and retains an environmental hero's glow in Southern California, where he's now busily greening the city's sootchoked port.
\
The 55-year-old Nahai, by contrast, ran his own private real estate law firm before coming to the utility. He wears elegantly cut suits and delivers his words in a refined, British-inflected English. But in all the important ways, he is Freeman's philosophical heir: Next to the challenge of weaning his city off coal, all other concerns pale.
\
""The effects on the environment and the repercussions (of transmission) - we agonize over it all the time,"" Nahai says. ""But I remain convinced that those Salton Sea resources are the only fuel to replace coal. And it is in the best interest of the state and all of its citizens that we access them.""
\
A year ago, Nahai described this as acting on behalf of the ""greater good."" The wording was unfortunate, echoing as it did the same utilitarian principle - the greatest good for the greatest number Franklin D. Roosevelt used to justify the Owens Valley water deal. Desert residents seized on it. ""Whose 'greater good' are we talking about?"" gripes April Sall, who manages two preserves in the Mojave for The Wildlands Conservancy. ""What about the greater good of future generations who won't have this land to enjoy?""
\
A serious 28-year-old with a blond ponytail and a rosy tan, Sall is a third-generation citizen of this desert. Her family has lived here since her grandmother came out as a young single woman in the 1920s and built her own house in the rocks. Sall left the area to earn a biology degree at Humboldt State University, but later returned, determined to defend her home. ""There was a lot of great conservation going on up on the North Coast with the Redwoods,"" she says. ""There were not as many people working to save the desert.""
\
Sall and her allies find many parallels between the Los Angeles Aqueduct and the Green Path North. In 1906, William Mulholland inveigled Gifford Pinchot into declaring the Owens Valley federal forest so the city wouldn't have to buy off private landowners; now the LADWP has asked the federal government to classify its preferred route as a federal energy corridor. Congress granted a right of way for the Los Angeles aqueduct only after the city promised it would use the water solely for nonindustrial purposes; the LADWP hopes to smooth the way for its transmission line by dedicating it only to green power.
\
""The general sentiment that we're finding as desert residents and biologists is that Los Angeles thinks the desert is a place to dump things,"" says Sall. ""First it's their trash, then their nuclear waste. Now it's their energy projects.""
\
ALMOST SINCE GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE built an 11,000-volt power line to transport electricity 20 miles from Niagara Falls to Buffalo, N.Y., the transmission of electrical power has stirred up trouble. Cities go dark when there isn't enough of it; expensive wind projects go underused because no one can agree on who will front the money for the power lines. Because there's a financial incentive for utilities to own transmission - it means they don't have to pay ""wheeling fees"" to use another company's lines - sometimes more transmission gets built than anyone really needs. Most of the time, however, energy companies complain that energy is like food: There's plenty to go around, and no one would starve if only the distribution were better.
\
It was with that complaint in mind that Congress in 2005 designated routes through federal lands in 11 Western states, plus more potential transmission through private land in the Southwest and Northeast. If local and state governments attempt to block these corridors, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can step in after a year and, under the provisions of the energy bill, push the projects through. Consequently, the protests of the Mojave activists are being echoed throughout the West. The sweeping environmental impact report for the West-Wide Energy Corridor designates more than 6,000 miles of corridors - and completing them will require rezoning some 165 wilderness areas.
\
The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance is fighting a transmission corridor that will plow a route along Utah's Moab Rim. In Oregon, conservation groups oppose a proposed gas line that would bore under rivers in the Mount Hood National Forest. According to the map of proposed transmission routes issued by the Department of Energy, the state of Nevada could be divided up like a quilt to transport energy straight through the Desert National Wildlife Complex. ""No opening of any wilderness areas in this state to any energy corridors ever,"" Bill Huggins of Friends of the Nevada Wilderness told the Department of Energy at a public meeting in Las Vegas. ""Absolutely not.""
\
""It's hard to see which Western constituency could possibly support this,"" said Amy Atwood, a staff attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, at meeting in Portland, Ore. ""But the answer, of course, is that the constituency that supports this doesn't live in the West. It lives on Wall Street and in D. C, and it is attempting, essentially ... to sell off as much of our public lands as possible for energy development before public outcry rises to the degree that such policy choices will no longer be tolerated.""
\
Some of these battles have clearer lines than others. An energy corridor devoted to bringing more oil out of Utah likely serves no environmental agenda. Come out against a project that brings wind energy down from Wyoming, however, or moves electricity from large-scale solar installations to coal-dependent cities, and you come out against polar bears and in favor of cataclysmic drought, all to prevent a localized disturbance in your backyard. No matter how pristine that backyard, or how many rare species it contains, saving it can't possibly trump saving the coasts from rising seas.
\
All this has inspired some California leaders to suggest that only conservationists now stand in the way of renewable energy. In an April 18 speech at Yale University's Climate Change Conference, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced that ""the Germans, the French, the Canadians, the Japanese, they all want to come out to California and put solar power plants in the Mojave desert and in other places. The only thing is that the problem is getting that new energy to the power grid because of environmental hurdles.""
\
""I think Gov. Schwarzenegger so wants to see progress that he's becoming impatient,"" says Carl Zichella, the Sierra Club's regional staff director for Southern California. ""I share the governor's impatience, but we're working as fast as we can."" Moving large utilities off coal and onto renewables, he says, ""is a little like turning the Exxon Valdez around.""
\
For the past year, Zichella has been part of the Renewable Energy Transmission Initiative (RETI), a statewide consortium of energy companies, land-management agencies and environmental groups devoted to solving the myriad problems associated with bringing carbon-free power to market. He's also participating in the Western Governors' Association's Western Renewable Energy Zones project, which had its kickoff meeting May 28 in Salt Lake City. The WGA foresees adding 30,000 megawatts of ""new clean and diverse energy"" to the Western states' grid by 2015.
\
""Avoiding protected areas of the desert is going to be a neat trick,"" Zichella says, ""but that doesn't mean it can't be done. The thing people have to keep in the back of their minds is that FERC has the authority to build lines. That makes it incumbent upon us to make sure those lines are dedicated to renewable energy, and that we're not facilitating the development of coal.""
\
Zichella is reserving judgment on the Green Path North until the LA. Department of Water and Power officially announces a route, hoping the utility will choose to work with Southern California Edison to share a right of way along the freeway corridor. He is less diplomatic, however, about another proposed transmission line to the south, San Diego Gas & Electric's Sunrise Powerlink. ""The Sunrise Powerlink is an example of a project that has been jammed through without public support or environmental safeguards,"" Zichella says. ""It would be a mistake to allow it to be built.""
\
Like the Green Path North, the $1.5 billion, 150-mile Sunrise Powerlink has been pitched as a way of transporting geothermal from the Salton Sea and solar power from large-scale projects the desert. Its preferred route also cuts through pristine bighorn sheep habitat, in California's much-beloved Anza Borrego State Park. A report issued in January by the California Public Utilities Commission flatly concludes that the investor-owned SDG&E's preferred route for the Sunrise Powerlink would devastate the wilderness. The report goes on to recommend several alternatives, including upgrading existing transmission lines that the California Independent System Operator has declared critically congested.
\
Schwarzenegger, however, likes the Sunrise Powerlink just fine - and not, his office says, just because the San Diego utility's parent corporation, Sempra Energy, donated $25,000 to his inaugural committee. (Shortly after he announced his support for the Powerlink, Sempra poured another $50,000 into a redistricting effort the governor wants on the next state ballot.) The environmentalists, he told the Yale audience, are engaging in a ""kind of a schizophrenic behavior. They say that we want renewable energy but we don't want you to put it anywhere.""
\
David Hogan of the Center for Biological Diversity says that it's not that simple. He doubts whether the Sunrise Powerlink will carry as much renewable energy as it does natural gas-fired power from a plant Sempra recently acquired in northern Mexico. ""Sempra has invested billions in a liquefied natural gas facility in Baja,"" he says, ""and they need a way to get that to market. That's what the Sunrise Powerlink is for.""
\
Other Powerlink opponents doubt the viability of the Salton Sea fields, claiming that the utilities have an inflated sense of how much power lies waiting there or how much can be harnessed without draining half the sea. But a seismic survey commissioned by CalEnergy, which already operates a 340 megawatt operation at the site, shows that the Salton Sea geothermal fields (SSGF) may be hotter and deeper than anyone guessed, with enough steamy brine to spin out 2,330 megawatts for more than 30 years and power more than 2 million homes.
\
""We think it's the largest geothermal field in the planet,"" says CalEnergy's vice president, Vince Signorotti. And while CalEnergy has not taken an official position on either the Green Path North or the Sunrise Powerlink, Signorotti does have an opinion about transmission in general. ""I think what we need to do as a state is take a step back and look at what's happened in the last 30 years. Have we kept pace with the development of new transmission? The answer is clearly no. And that's irresponsible.""
\
EARLY ON, WHEN LADWP'S SURVEY markers started to appear in nature preserves and on private property, a group of desert activists calling themselves the California Desert Coalition set out to document them using GPS coordinates. Two of those activists, Ruth Rieman and Donna Thomas, led residents and journalists on regular visits to the sites, to show off not only the markers but the area's dramatic mesquite-covered washes, thousand-foot bluffs and, this spring, its wildflowers. But when the two women hiked out to the Big Morongo preserve in April, they found that all the survey markers had disappeared. Only mounds of disturbed soil remained.
\
""They didn't brush out their tracks,"" Rieman muttered disapprovingly.
\
""I ordered all of those markers taken out,"" Nahai says. ""I wrote personal letters to all of the property owners that were affected to explain that the markers were being removed, and that they were not intended to indicate a decided pathway. We're going to have a very open and visible process before deciding on a route.""
\
The move was intended, he adds, ""to alleviate anxiety."" Instead, it seemed only to compound suspicions.
\
""There's no question there's an urgency about the greenhouse gas situation and the need for California to make a statement. It's a question of how they do it, and the process they take to arrive at it,"" says Joan Taylor, chair of the energy committee for the Sierra Club's desert chapter. ""Trespassing on land and putting monuments in and building brand-new transmission corridors through ecologically sensitive areas, and then lying about it -that just isn't a good way to start.""
\
Nahai, who takes pride in his environmental credibility - he's a father of three who often invokes his children's future when making his case for the planet - appears pained by the controversy. He has served on the local water board, on the board of the League of Conservation Voters, and it was under his watch as commission chair that the LADWP finally made good on its agreement to return water to the Owens Valley (""There it is,"" he announced at the unveiling of the reverse-pumping project, ""give it back,"" a magnanimous flip-flop of Mulholland's 1913 declaration, ""There it is, take it."")
\
Nahai guarantees that the Green Path North will carry only carbon-free sources of electricity along its route. In late April, the LADWP inked an agreement with the Salton Sea-adjacent Imperial Irrigation District to begin work on its first 200-megawatt plant. It seems unlikely that the utility will cave to the Mojave conservationists' demands.
\
It comes down to this, Nahai says: ""What is it that we're going to do as a state and a society? If we have announced to the world, as we have, that we're going to foster and support renewable energy, that we're going to open our doors to the renewables industry, then we have got to live up to our promises.""
\
And besides, as Schwarzenegger remarked in his Yale speech, ""If you can't put solar panels in the Mojave Desert, where the hell can you put them?""
\
""How about on the rooftops and parking lots of the cities that actually use the power?"" suggests Taylor. ""If you're worried about energy security, generate it where it's used."" She points to Southern California Edison's rooftop solar effort, launched April 2, to put a total of two square miles of photovoltaic panels atop warehouses in the inland counties of San Bernardino and Riverside. In five years, the $875 million project will generate 225 megawatts of electricity at peak hours, enough to serve 162,000 homes.
\
Yet even that kind of massive solar project only nicks away at the needs of coal-fired Los Angeles, which in the summer of 2006 hit a peak load exceeding 6,000 megawatts. LADWP will spend $300 million over the next 10 years to install 280 megawatts of locally generated power. It broke ground in March on the Pine Tree Wind Farm in the Mojave's Jawbone Canyon, a project that the Audubon Society fought bitterly; it will soon be the largest municipally owned wind project in the nation. The city has passed a green building ordinance requiring a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency for all new construction. But to meet its 35 percent by 2020 goal, Nahai says, it still needs transmission to the Salton Sea.
\
Vince Signorotti agrees. ""I don't believe any of the (utilities) are going to get to their magic number without the Salton Sea being developed,"" he says. ""It's just an incredibly important resource.""

The new greenhouse gas emission standards of the Environmental Protection Agency may yield just under 4 percent of real emissions reduction from 1990 levels, due to a shifting away from the international standard of 1990 in the president's choice of 2005 for his baseline. In 2005, the United States saw a high water mark in emissions (particularly from coal) that directly preceded the recession and the discovery of cleaner-burning natural gas from the shale bonanza.
\
Nonetheless scaremongering about a war on coal, various conservative state governors are promising to thumb their nose to the EPA regulations, as they have done to the health care law, even as public health is a clear issue involved with the burning of coal.
\
Consider Indiana. Laced with coal plants and neurotoxins, southwest Indiana has been dubbed ""one of the most toxic environments on earth"" by editors of Bloomington Alternative, with a reported epidemic of multiple sclerosis and autism. Still, Governor Mike Pence has sworn to resist the EPA rules any way he can, even as his state is powered 80 percent by coal -- a ridiculously risky over-reliance on one fuel for any state. Pence conflicts with his own counties that seek wind power manufacturing at their high tech facilities near major highways, plus more wind plants to reap the impressive wind resources near to high power transmission. What is Pence thinking?
\
Making money in clean energy sure beats a criminal investigation, as seen in the drama of Duke Energy's massive coal ash spill spoiling 70 miles of the Dan River in North Carolina, involving the state's environmental agency and Governor Pat McCrory at the heart of the probe. A Kentucky utility is also being sued for allegedly dumping coal ash waste into local waterways as depicted in a year of footage by hidden camera. And God help West Virginia's Kanawha Valley after two coal processing chemical spills of this year.
\
With the rash of toxic abuses to health and environment, you would think that politicians and citizens in coal-reliant states would learn to sound a more moderate note in response to the EPA regulations. The EPA hasn't foisted a war on coal. The geologic difficulty of mining ever-deeper reserves combined with downward price pressures from cheap natural gas and affordable renewables and efficiency, and coal is losing out by free market forces.
\
Still spoiling for a propaganda fight, the U.S. coal industry has long been punching above its political weight. Five years ago activists arched their eyebrows to learn that the U.S. coal industry was estimated to be worth only about $50 billion -- slightly under today's market cap of Starbucks. Now it's even worse. Down from an industry high in June of 2008, today ""Big Coal"" is worth only about $19 billion (Russell 3000 index) -- slightly better than burrito retailer Chipotle Mexican Grill.
\
For the political blessing of a has-been industry now worth little more than a burrito seller, the Republican Party that invented cap-and-trade for the successful control of acid rain now would have our nation fly at unrelenting speed into the brick wall of dangerous climate change. In it we see the proud posturing of the last well-fed rat on the prow of a sinking ship, which is what the U.S. coal industry has become with its bankruptcies and shrunken shareholder value. It's time to jump.
\
Still, the conservative opposition is only one sticky obstacle to reducing heat-trapping gasses. Firming up the leakage of our burgeoning natural gas industry is next. In Showtime's episode 6 ""Years of Living Dangerously,"" Gabby Patron of Boulder's office of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has measured a direct correlation between fracking and fugitive methane emissions, asserting that key production basins, such as the Denver, and Utah's Uinta basin and the Los Angeles basin, are losing natural gas products to the air by 4, 11, and 17 percent respectively. As we know, natural gas is 80 times more powerful than CO2 for trapping heat, and until the EPA targets leakage with independent (not industry-based) verification, there is little assurance that coal is our worst offense against the climate.
\
Colorado's electricity is in the nation's top 10 of CO2 emitters. Still, we are well prepared on many fronts with plans for ""zero tolerance"" of methane emissions, retirement of 900 megawatts of coal plants, and ongoing installation of renewables. We should support the EPA regulations as something achievable and necessary, while truly only bringing up the rear. We should work to exceed them.

30,"At the Lory Student Center Theatre on Nov. 15, there was a screening of the documentary ""Climate Refugees,"" produced by Michael Nash. The film will be shown at the U.N. Climate Change Framework Convention in Copenhagen on Dec. 7-18.\After the film, there was a panel discussion including Nash and three CSU professors -Michele Betsill, associate professor of political science; Scott Denning, professor of atmospheric science; and Lori Peek, assistant professor of sociology.\I asked the panel members if they had read either the 181-page Copenhagen draft or the 1,428-page ""cap and trade"" bill, H.R. 2454, that was narrowly passed by the House 219-212. It was disappointing to hear that none of the Colorado State University professors had read either document.\How can these three CSU professors support a film that will be shown at the U.N. Climate Change Convention in Copenhagen when they haven't read these documents?\The same question should be asked of Pat McConathy, chairman of the CSU System Board of Governors and executive producer of the movie ""Climate Refugees.""\In a Wall Street Journal article, ""Has Anyone Read the Copenhagen Agreement?"" Janet Albrechtsen wrote: ""Lord Monckton warns that the aim of the Copenhagen draft treaty is to set up a transnational 'government' on a scale the world has never before seen.""\Lord Monckton was a former science adviser to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and is a well-known critic of the theory of anthropogenic causes for global warming.\He has argued repeatedly that global warming hysteria is an ideological position of the political left advanced in the interest of imposing global taxes on the United States in the pursuit of international control of the U.S. economy under a U.N. government.\Albrechtsen continued: ""The scheme for the new institutional arrangement under the convention that starts on page 18 contains the provision for a 'government.' The aim is to give a new as yet unnamed U.N. body the power to directly intervene in the financial, economic, tax and environmental affairs of all the nations that sign the Copenhagen treaty.""\We need to understand the agenda behind the Copenhagen treaty and the risk of possibly losing our national sovereignty to a global government administered by the U.N.\As Albrechtsen points out, ""Given that our political leaders spend hundreds of hours talking about climate change and the need for a global consensus in Copenhagen, why have none of them talked openly about the details of this draft climate-change treaty?""\Why indeed? Hopefully the professors and students at CSU will read these documents and debate the merits of the proposals.\While I support a healthy environment using free-market solutions, I will also defend our Constitution and national sovereignty against any potential power- grab by the United Nations.\I welcome a vigorous debate on this subject soon.\Carl Bruning lives in Fort Collins."

Last month, executives from six of the country's largest energy companies made a startling request to federal lawmakers: Set mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions.
\
At an April 4 climate conference held by New Mexico Sens. Pete Domenici, R, and Jeff Bingaman, D, the leaders of Shell, General Electric and others said they would prefer uniform federal regulation to a patchwork of emissions rules like those proposed by California and eight New England states (HCN, 3/6/06). Federal regulation would not pre-empt those plans, which are so far stricter than any congressional proposal. But the corporations hope that other states would follow the feds' lead instead of acting on their own.
\
The corporations' new tone could press federal lawmakers into action, says David Doniger, policy director for the Natural Resource Defense Council's Climate Center: ""This will be looked back on as a watershed moment.""
\
Yet even representatives who support climate legislation still don't agree on how strict the emissions caps should be, says Marnie Funk, Republican spokeswoman for the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. She cites the McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act, which has languished in Congress for three years.
\
That legislation includes a ""cap and trade"" program for greenhouse gases. Sens. Domenici and Bingaman plan to include a similar program in a new climate bill, but neither wants to introduce the bill within the next year, fearing that it, too, will be shot down.
\
Late last year, a National Academy of Sciences report predicted that impacts to the economy and environment will be more costly the longer emissions go unchecked.

"
32,"President Barack Obama told the United Nations we're running out of time to fight global warming. His science czar, based on past writings, would resolve this alleged crisis with forced abortions, sterilization, and other population control measures if given the chance.\Imagine a government in which authorities control the reproductive rights of women, as they do in China. Government-run health care could be a useful tool in this endeavor.\It seems unlikely, however, that government would do this in the United States, or most other developed nations. The governments of most Western European countries do exactly the opposite. They pay couples to produce children, because their societies and economies are threatened by the diminishing populations Europe has been experiencing in recent years.\In the United States, most Americans know the ramifications a lean fertility rate has on Social Security. An aging population base results in too many Social Security beneficiaries and too few contributors to the fund. Americans are beginning to connect the dots regarding other aspects of the economy. A lean future workforce might devastate pensions, undermine immigration standards, and threaten the welfare of production and trade just as it may impoverish Social Security.\Others have a different concern. They advocate a leaner future population base in order to save the planet from theories that say humans are destroying it.\""We understand the gravity of the climate threat,"" Obama said Tuesday at the United Nations. ""We are determined to act. And we will meet our responsibility to future generations.""\Obama said failing to act quickly could cause ""irreversible catastrophe.""\So far, Obama has addressed his seemingly radical concerns about global warming by approving new standards for automotive fuel efficiency. He helped convince the United States House of Representatives to pass a sweeping cap-and-trade bill that would tax emissions of pollutants theorized to cause global warming. He has made no mention of opposing tax incentives that reward couples for producing children, so he isn't even in the ballpark of advocating government-imposed population control.\Obama's approach to global warming theory so far has been relatively moderate, if one looks at the agendas of more radical global warming theorists. One global warming alarmist who makes Obama seem moderate is White House Science adviser John Holdren, co-author of a now-famous book that advocates forced abortions and sterilizations in order to prevent ecological disasters including ""global warming"".\In his book, titled ""Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment,"" Holdren wrote: ""under the United States Constitution, effective population-control programs, even including laws requiring compulsory abortion, could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society.""\So, does Holdren believe a population crisis has become severe enough to endanger society in 2009 and 2010? You be the judge. Here is what he said to the U.S. Senate's Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation July 30, explaining global warming as an immediate crisis:\""The air and the oceans are warming, mountain glaciers are disappearing, sea ice is shrinking, permafrost is thawing, the great land ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica are showing signs of instability and sea level is rising,"" Holdren said. He said humans are already suffering more droughts, wildfires, heat waves, floods and diseases, and he blames it all on human activity.\The health care plan Obama advocates has no mention of forced abortions or sterilizations, of course, and it is difficult to imagine Obama wants to control the reproductive decisions of women.\Holdren, however, would like to do just that. He clearly hopes for the day when government will control the reproductive rights of Americans. It's disconcerting that our president has surrounded himself with the likes of Holdren and other kooks who frighten rational Americans more than theories of global warming gloom and doom. An alarmist White House science adviser, who has advocated forced abortion and sterilization, won't help Obama's effort to sell the idea of more government involvement in health care."
33,"There's good news on the environmental front out of Washington D.C., but it's probably more than offset by a devastating announcement on April 17.\First, the good news. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the Environmental Protection Agency, when upgrading older power plants, may consider costs before demanding use of the most advanced technology, as required by law. The ruling was a defeat for environmentalists, who challenged the Bush administration's discretionary practice.\Hans Bader, special projects counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute think tank, noted the ruling permits continued cost-benefit analysis as an option in upgrades such as the one at issue in the lawsuit brought by New York-based environmental group Riverkeeper. The group sued under the Clean Water Act's requirement that upgrades must include ""the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact."" \Water drawn from U.S. waterways to cool power-plant machinery kills billions of fish and other small aquatic creatures that are crushed against intake screens or sucked into cooling systems. Newer plants with advanced technology reduce the kill rate by 98 percent. \If government required the ""best technology available"" in every case it would cost $3.5 billion a year, according to the EPA's estimate. While the ruling let stand the Bush administration's weighing of costs against environmental benefits, it is unknown how President Barack Obama's EPA will use that same discretion. \The bad news is that the EPA declared carbon dioxide and five other so-called greenhouse gas emissions to be harmful, under similar discretion provided by a previous high-court ruling. Finding the naturally occurring CO2 harmful gives government the authority to regulate the gas as it does truly harmful air pollutants. \CEI and other free-market advocates had written EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, warning that such a finding would ""set the stage for an economic train wreck."" The EPA's determination that CO2 endangers the environment by contributing to the greenhouse gas effect - a point disputed among scientists - triggers a rule-making procedure that will affect ""1.2 million previously unregulated entities, office buildings, big box stores, enclosed malls, hotels, apartment buildings, even commercial kitchens,"" said the letter from Marlo Lewis, CEI senior fellow, and others.\The EPA can use its CO2 finding to pressure Congress to pass cap-and-trade regulations to limit emissions, and to require businesses to buy ""permits"" for annually declining emissions levels. If Congress balks, as it did last year, the Obama administration could threaten to achieve the same restrictions by administrative edict.\Unlike the power-plant case, the law doesn't give the EPA cost-benefit discretion for air quality matters. By the agency determining CO2 to be harmful, it necessarily triggers rule-making that explicitly may not take costs into account, Bader said. \Nevertheless, in both cases, the Obama administration has the power to determine how much economic pain to inflict. It can and should weigh the high economic cost of protecting tiny fish, but also should minimize the regulatory damage regarding CO2 until the scientific question is settled."
34,"Americans are not going to pay for pie-in-the sky schemes designed to alter the climate. Most dont believe the theory of anthropogenic global warming, and they dont much care. Nor will they waste time, money or energy trying to undo immigration trends of the past two decades.\Likewise, anyone who still believes Americans will fall for free health care from the government is sadly mistaken.\Its a new era, and President Obamas state of the union address reflected that. He downplayed the old bold pie-inthe-sky political promises, replacing them with sounds of economic discipline and concerns about employment. The party is over, its time to get serious, and savvy politicians know it.\Hangovers hurt, and America is trying to get through a bad one. Throughout the 1990s and part of the past decade, Americans enjoyed a party in the form of seemingly endless faux prosperity. The economy was artificially propped up by superficially low interest rates (thank the Federal Reserve), easy credit (thank Congress, President George W. Bush, Freddie Mac, Fannie May and other complicit banks), and access to seemingly unlimited cheap goods from China. Artificial ifllation of the value of homes was mistaken as economic growth. Money was mistaken as wealth. Loans, on a household scale and a national scale, were mistaken as income.\Predictably, it all came crashing down.\During the era of economic pretense, Americans had the luxury to fret about theorized environmental catastrophes. We could afford anything, including legislation that would change the weather and save polar bears adrift on melting icebergs. In our economic drunkenness, we believed the United States could afford to give away health care with no concern about the relatively fixed supply of doctors, nurses and hospitals.\On the left, politicians campaigned on promises of free government health care and a government cure for the hurricanes, floods and tornadoes -- not to mention the looming Armageddon -- caused by global warming.\On the right, the haze of the faux financial boom led politicians and pundits to make a crisis of natural immigration trends. Immigrants had poured into this country when we had a shortage of workers, caused by an aging generation in need of services and production but devoid of younger generations large enough in numbers to provide them.\Those were the issues of the past decade, and today we can all consider them all but finished. Politicians and pundits who parade them today will have the appeal of runway models wearing last years designs.\Each year The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press conducts a scientific poll about the publics priorities. This years poll asked Americans to prioritize 21 categories of concerns, ranging from the economy, to energy, to global warming. The top concern, by far, was the economy, with 83 percent of those polled ranking it as top priority. Second, with 81 percent support, was jobs. Of course, jobs and the economy should not have been separate categories. The only jobs of lasting value, to an individual or the economy as a whole, are those which result as a byproduct of the demands of a free economy.\Ranking below the economy and jobs was terrorism, followed by social security, followed by education. The concern health insurance ranked 12th, with health care ranking eighth.\Concerns about the environment ranked 16th. Global warming came in dead least, at number 21. Good luck with that cap and trade bill, Congress.\The 28 percent ranking global warning as a top concern is a drop from 38 percent just three years ago. Support for the concern has dropped reliably since 2007, and it will likely continue to decline as alarmist theories continue to unravel.\Likewise, the window of opportunity to socialize health care has probably come and gone. So has the opportunity to capitalize politically on the limited xenophobia inspired by Latin American immigration.\Americans are no longer enjoying the buzz of faux economic prosperity. Today, theyre suffering withdrawal and coping with cold, hard reality. More than ever, they are confronting real concerns about money, employment, our countys dearth in education, and the threat of faraway religious fanatics with a murderous hatred of the United States. Americans have sobered up, which may be the best economic indicator of all. -- By Wayne Laugesen, editorial page editor, for the editorial board"

Hillary joins climate debate
\
Hillary Rodham Clinton has promised a series of initiatives to address the challenge of climate change. The first installment, unveiled this week in Iowa, calls for an aggressive expansion of wind, solar and other carbon-free energy sources so that they provide one-third of America's electricity by 2027 -- enough, she says, to power every home in the country.
\
Mrs. Clinton at least is willing to confront global warming, which her prospective Republican opponents have been doing their best to avoid, belittle and deny. But as solutions go, setting goals isn't much. Getting there is the tough part. And even then, renewables can be only part of a comprehensive energy strategy.
\
The plan's centerpiece is a huge, sevenfold bump in solar-generated power, which, despite the sharp drop in the price of solar panels, now provides only a tiny fraction of the nation's energy. Renewable energy sources overall furnish just 13 percent of America's electricity (natural gas, coal and nuclear power account for nearly all the rest), with hydropower at 6 percent, wind power at 4.4 percent and the remainder coming from geothermal, biomass and solar (less than 1 percent).
\
Mrs. Clinton would enlarge and make permanent existing tax incentives for wind and solar power that are now perilously dependent on periodic congressional renewal. She would open more federal land to wind and solar installations. She would streamline the permitting process so it doesn't take years to get another offshore wind farm up and running, and help build a transmission system capable of carrying wind and solar energy from remote locations. She pledges full support for President Obama's forthcoming plan to shut down old coal-fired power plants, which would almost certainly force states to turn to cleaner sources of energy.
\
There is no mention, however, of the one mechanism that would guarantee a shift in the way the country produces and consumes energy, namely putting a price on carbon emissions, presumably with a tax. Mrs. Clinton has already been through the carbon pricing wars in Congress (including an ill-fated cap and trade bill she supported in 2008) and apparently sees it as a lost cause in the current political environment.
\
If the global warming's worst consequences are to be avoided, a big chunk of the world's fossil fuels will have to stay in the ground. A big test of Mrs. Clinton's commitments will be whether and how she addresses this reality.

Proceed with caution on bag ban
\
Americans use an estimated 100 billion plastic bags every year. In Minnesota, along with wrappers and shrink wrap, the bags accounted for about 192,600 tons of statewide trash in 2013, according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.
\
Some Minneapolis retailers have expressed legitimate concerns about a city-only plastic bag ban, arguing that a statewide solution would be the best way to keep shoppers from simply crossing a city border to avoid the ban. Other stores have said their costs would increase because they pay more for paper than plastic, and that increase likely would result in higher prices. It's also worth noting that paper bags take more energy to produce.
\
Those concerns need a full airing, but they do not negate the need to reduce plastic bag use. Without question, the bags have morphed into an environmental hazard. Like polystyrene foam (commonly known as Styrofoam), most are not biodegradable and will stay in landfills for decades or centuries.
\
The proposal for a city ban starts an important environmental discussion in Minneapolis. Because of the widespread impact on consumers and business, however, it's a discussion that needs to proceed with caution.

"
36,"""The trouble with the eco-crusader is that his false guilt and his false fears feed endlessly upon each other."" With Earth Day upon us, I remembered this line from an old presidential speech. Can you guess who said it?\""From the emotional remorse that we have sinned terribly against nature,"" it continues, ""there is but a short step to the emotional dread that nature will visit terrible retribution upon us. The eco-crusader becomes, as a result, deaf to reason and science, blind to perspective and priorities, incapable of effective action.""\That's telling'em, Mr. President. Or it would have been, if Richard Nixon hadn't let staffers talk him out of giving the Eco-Crusader speech in September 1971.\Fired up by attacks on the ""disaster lobby"" by Look magazine publisher Thomas Shepard, and uneasy about his own role in establishing the Environmental Protection Agency after the first Earth Day in 1970, Nixon directed me and other speechwriters to produce a warning against ecological extremism that he could deliver as a major address.\Our draft died on his desk amid concerns about political backlash. I kept the file as a historical curiosity - the presidential bombshell that wasn't.\Today, four decades into the age of true-believing green religion, Nixon's undelivered speech reads prophetically.\So does Shepard's diagnosis that the environmental doomsayers ""are basically opposed to the free enterprise system and will do anything to bolster their case for additional government controls."" So does the denunciation by Prof. Peter Drucker, another source we consulted at the time, of the green fallacy ""that one can somehow deprive human action of risk."" The battle lines have changed little in 38 years.\I wish now that President Nixon, a gambler in foreign policy, had risked this piece of domestic truth-telling. One politically incorrect speech from the White House couldn't have halted the tides of earth-worshipping guilt and fear that still engulf us. But it would have been a start. With braver leadership, sooner, America's voices for environmental common sense might have been less outnumbered today.\Two of those lonely voices were in Colorado last week. Terry Anderson, head of the Montana-based Property & Environment Research Center, and Christopher Horner, a fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., brought a coolly factual message to deflate some of the new-energy hype and carbon-phobia that Bill Ritter trades on and Obama wants to emulate.\Anderson literally wrote the book on free-market environmentalism - a 1991 volume by that title. He told the Independence Institute about PERC's research on such inconvenient truths as the wildly oversold benefits of green jobs and the grim toll that cap-and-trade legislation to mitigate CO2 will take on our standard of living.\Horner's current book is ""Red Hot Lies: How Global Warming Alarmists Use Threats, Fraud, and Deception to Keep You Misinformed."" He told the Centennial Institute, where I work, that a recessionary economy and 10 straight years of global cooling make this the worst time for a burdensome new carbon tax that ""would not detectably impact climate anyway.""\If the eco-crusaders were serious about cleaner energy, says Horner, they would support nuclear power. They aren't, so they don't. And again, we find the battle lines unchanged; the nuclear debate also pervades my 1971 White House file.\No, their aim is control, as Thomas Shepard warned. ""For a new enemy to unite us, the threat of global warming fits the bill,"" gloated the anti-growth Club of Rome in 1991.\Cheerleading mainstream journalists have decided the likes of Horner and Anderson ""are not news,"" as one bluntly told me - so you heard little about their visit to Ritterville. The governor letting three eco-crusading foundations pay his climate czar's salary has caused no stir either. What sheep we are.\-\Andrews is a former president of the Colorado Senate and directs the Centennial Institute at Colorado Christian University.\Credit: JOHN ANDREWS; GUEST COLUMNIST"
37,"
There may be a time when John Boehner becomes a hate figure. Say, after he loses a government-shutdown fight with the president and makes enough radioactive comments that he starts to glow -- Newt Gingrich's path to notoriety in the 1990s.
\
Until then, the leader of a Republican House minority that's routinely been trampled by Democrats with their 70-vote margin is not going to make a deep impression, no matter how much President Barack Obama inveighs against his callous disregard for all that is right and good.
\
It must have been a sad, desultory meeting of White House strategists when they settled on an anti-Boehner campaign: ""Well, we could run on our economic record, except, well ... There's always ObamaCare, except, well ... The change we brought to Washington? I know, I know ... Hey, how about that perpetually tanned Republican? Let's run against that guy!""
\
The Democratic firm Public Policy Polling recently found that 42 percent of voters in Boehner's home state of Ohio have no opinion of him. According to a Fox News poll earlier this year, 55 percent of people nationally had never heard of him. The White House figures people will hate Boehner with an unbridled passion -- if only they could remember his name.
\
This is the very definition of sliding-off-a-cliff, grasping-at-saplings desperation. Obama traveled to Cleveland last week to give a speech responding to an economic address by Boehner there a couple of weeks prior. Boehner's speech had mostly been ignored by the press at the time, since it hadn't occurred to anyone that he was the pivot upon which the future of the nation would turn.
\
Obama excoriated Boehner for fighting against his economic policies. With a less hostile intent, this attack on Boehner could have been an advertisement for him. According to Gallup, the only major piece of Obama legislation that Boehner said ""no"" to that's popular is financial reform. A majority disapproves of everything else: the stimulus, auto bailout and health-care reform.
\
Never letting a White House attack line go to waste, The New York Times immediately ran a front-page article on Boehner, ""A G.O.P Leader Tightly Bound to Lobbyists."" It combined nonrevelations (a pro-business Republican works with business lobbyists) with incredible claims (one anonymous lobbyist implied that Boehner opposed cap-and-trade, a policy anathema to conservative Republicans, as a favor).
\
The Republicanism of John Boehner is not particularly inspiring, but neither is it threatening. You're likelier to see him at an outing at a fancy golf resort than leading a fanciful, ideological crusade. If he lacks the intellectual flair of the last Republican House minority leader who became speaker in an electoral rout, Newt Gingrich, he also lacks his manic grandiosity. He's perfectly suited as a solid, conservative check on the overly liberal, hubristic young man who's president of the United States.
\
The White House doesn't seem to care that in sending the president out after Boehner in attack-dog mode, it's diminishing him. Why waste the majesty of his teleprompter on the House minority leader? This is usually the demeaning work of a chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who no one expects to rise above partisan hackery.
\
Obama's political team thinks it can find some gimmicky way out of its predicament. A few months ago, it fastened on the gaffe of another Republican no one had heard of, the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who offered (an instantly retracted) apology to BP for its treatment at the hands of the government. Democrats had barely finished congratulating themselves on their brilliance than the entire episode was forgotten.
\
The election is about large things: The tectonic shift to the left undertaken by Democrats during the past two years, and the enormous public reaction against it. In this environment, John Boehner is but a dot on a vast electoral tide. Obama's focus on him speaks to a self-deluding lack of perspective. What else is new?

38,"DavidYoung@coloradoan.com\Industry leaders for the renewable-energy economy in Colorado, pioneering new and innovative ways to power the state and country, gathered Tuesday at CSU to champion their growing business sector.\The message was clear - renewable energy is not only good for the environment but the economy, state and country.\With a focus on federal legislation, such as the American Clean Energy and Security Act, it is also evident that the United States still has a lot of ground to cover in order to make renewable energy a viable and competitive resource on the global market.\Between Vestas Americas and Abound Solar, wind and solar power were well represented at the forum in Colorado State University's Lory Student Center.\All seven speakers from across the state agreed the renewable-energy sector is growing at a rapid rate, and with the right legislation, Colorado is well-positioned to capitalize on the renewable revolution Bella Energy CEO Jim Welch dubbed as big as the IT industry.\Welch, who provides solar solutions to companies, said he saw a 210 percent compound annual growth in business when Amendment 37 passed in 2004 instituting a new Renewable Standard Portfolio, which requires 10 percent of electricity produced by the state to come from renewable sources by 2015.\""You pay a little bit more to build a market ... that will pay back over the next 20 to 30 years, and you will build the industry for your kids,"" Welch said. ""Solar can be decentralized and integrated in the grid.""\Welch projected that Colorado's renewable-energy sector is one of the state's fastest growing industries with $1.1 billion in revenue and 10,000 jobs this year. He projected that by 2030, that number could grow to $13 billion and 113,000 jobs.\Abound and Vestas are leading that charge in Colorado as the thin-film solar module and wind turbine companies are already ramping up productions, hiring employees and expanding facilities.\Nick Lenssen, senior specialist and market intelligence with Vestas, said between its facilities in Windsor, Brighton and Pueblo, Vestas will employ 2,500 people by the middle of 2010.\The Danish company is the world's largest producer of wind turbines. In 2007, the company decided to build its first U.S. blade production facility in Windsor based on geography, transportation and the available work force.\""Wind power is just about 2 percent of the nation's electricity, but it is growing tremendously,"" said Lenssen, who highlighted national policy and transmission of the energy as two areas that need to be addressed for the industry to thrive and grow.\TJ Deora, development manager for Horizon Wind Energy based in Houston, Texas, said Texas is leading the country when it comes to transmission, while Colorado sits eighth in the nation.\""The reality is the wind resource in Texas is not as good as the wind resource in Colorado,"" said Deora, who noted Colorado lacks proactive investment in transmission and an open market.\Abound Solar, a CSU start-up company 15 years in the making, is making its impact on the state as well with locations in Fort Collins, Loveland and Longmont.\Russell Kanjorski, vice president of marketing with Abound, said between $15 million in federal support and $150 million in private equity the solar module company is ramping up its first production facility in Longmont with 230 employees.\Kanjorski said at full production next year, they will create three million solar panels annually. Aside from the immediate jobs produced by the company, Kanjorski noted they work with local companies such as Wirsol, Advanced Energy and local vendors to bring more business home.\""This is an unbelievably huge market,"" he said. ""The energy market is the biggest in the world.""\For some time, Europe -- Germany, in particular -- has dominated the market when it comes to renewable energy.\Kanjorski used Germany as an example of where the United States could be one day if policy and federal regulations make the market a priority. He said Germany's renewable-energy sector has around 300,000 employees, which will soon eclipse the automotive industry there.\Reaction to the American Clean Energy and Security Act, designed to implement comprehensive energy and climate legislation that would establish cap and trade system to address climate change, by the representatives was less than enthusiastic.\Lenssen described the House version of the act as ""weak,"" while Anna Giovinetto, vice president of public affairs with Renewable Energy Systems Americas Inc., said that while the effort was appreciated, the bill is flawed.\Giovinetto said the standards are too low and are cannibalized by the energy efficiency.\To strive for improvements to the bill, Giovinetto said her organization has joined the Renewable Electricity Standard, or RES, Alliance for Jobs, which is a coalition of renewable energy companies and national renewable energy associations pushing for stronger energy legislation.\The alliance seeks a strong national RES, and Giovinetto said a strong American policy and oversight is needed to demonstrate to the world the U.S.'s commitment to renewable energy.\""Leading the world in renewable energy would revitalize the nation's economy,"" she said."

L ast week, a draft memo surfaced from the Homeland Security Department suggesting ways to administratively circumvent existing law to allow several categories of illegal immigrants to avoid deportation and, indeed, for some to be granted permanent residency. Most disturbing was the stated rationale. This was being proposed ""in the absence of Comprehensive Immigration Reform."" In other words, because Congress refuses to do what these bureaucrats would like to see done, they will legislate it themselves.
\
Regardless of your feelings on the substance of the immigration issue, this is not how a constitutional democracy should operate. Administrators administer the law, they don`t change it. That`s the legislators` job.
\
When questioned, the White House downplayed the toxic memo, leaving the impression that it was nothing more than ruminations emanating from the bowels of Homeland Security. But the administration is engaged in an even more significant power play elsewhere.
\
A 2007 Supreme Court ruling gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate carbon emissions if it could demonstrate that they threaten human health and the environment. The Obama EPA made precisely that finding, thereby granting itself a huge expansion of power and, noted The Washington Post, sending ""a message to Congress.""
\
It was not a terribly subtle message: Enact cap-and-trade legislation -- taxing and heavily regulating carbon-based energy -- or the EPA will do so unilaterally. As Frank O`Donnell of Clean Air Watch noted, such a finding ""is likely to help light a fire under Congress to get moving.""
\
Well, Congress didn`t. Despite the ""regulatory cudgel"" (to again quote the Post) the administration has been waving, the Senate has repeatedly refused to acquiesce.
\
Good for the Senate. But what to do when the executive is passively aggressive rather than actively so? Take border security. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., reports that President Obama told him about pressure from his political left and its concern that if the border is secured, Republicans will have no incentive to support comprehensive reform (i.e., amnesty). Indeed, Homeland Security`s abandonment of the ""virtual fence"" on the southern border, combined with its lack of interest in completing the real fence that today covers only one-third of the border, gives the distinct impression that serious border enforcement is not a high administration priority absent some Republican quid pro quo on comprehensive reform.
\
But border enforcement is not something to be manipulated in return for legislative favors. It is, as the administration vociferously argued in court in the Arizona case, the federal executive`s constitutional responsibility. Its job is to faithfully execute the laws. Non-execution is a dereliction of duty.
\
This contagion of executive willfulness is not confined to the federal government or to Democrats. In Virginia, the Republican attorney general has just issued a ruling allowing police to ask about one`s immigration status when stopped for some other reason (e.g., a traffic violation). Heretofore, police could inquire only upon arrest and imprisonment.
\
Whatever your views about the result, the process is suspect. If police latitude regarding the interrogation of possible illegal immigrants is to be expanded, that`s an issue for the legislature, not the executive.
\
How did we get here? I blame Henry Paulson. (Such a versatile sentence.) The gold standard of executive overreach was achieved the day he summoned the heads of the country`s nine largest banks and informed them that henceforth the federal government was their business partner. The banks were under no legal obligation to obey. But they know the capacity of the federal government, when crossed, to cause you trouble, endless trouble. They complied.
\
So did BP when the president summoned its top executives to the White House to demand a $20 billion federally administered escrow fund for damages. Existing law capped damages at $75 million. BP, like the banks, understood the power of the U.S. government. Twenty billion it was.
\
Again, you can be pleased with the result (I was), and still be troubled by how we got there. Everyone wants energy in the executive (as Alexander Hamilton called it). But not lawlessness. In the modern welfare state, government has the power to regulate your life. That`s bad enough. But at least there is one restraint on this bloated power: the separation of powers. Such constraints on your life must first be approved by both houses of Congress.
\
That`s called the consent of the governed. The constitutional order is meant to subject you to the will of the people`s representatives, not to the whim of a chief executive or the imagination of a loophole-seeking bureaucrat.

Guvs get their green on
\
Western governors are often thought of as bolo-tie and cowboy boot-wearing good ol' boys and gals uttering colloquialisms with a drawl, not as environmentalists. But regional state bosses have swaggered in a green direction as of late.
\
On Feb. 26, the governors of New Mexico, California, Arizona, Washington and Oregon all signed on to a regional pact that will limit greenhouse gas emissions and form a cap and trade program for carbon. The states have six months to agree on a regional emissions target, and 18 months to come up with ways to meet it.
\
Though each of the five states already has or will soon have emissions limits in place, the regional initiative makes the effort more efficient, says Judy Greenwald of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. By allowing for carbon trading across state lines ""you can do more for the environment for less money,"" she says.
\
Western guvs are also taking their green shitkickers into the gasfields. In order to streamline the gas and oil drilling permitting process, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 exempted some drilling projects from environmental analysis. On Feb. 27, the Western Governors' Association urged Congress to discard those exemptions and restore restrictions to protect wildlife corridors and habitat.
\
Coal is king of the energy world - Department of Energy forecasts say the black stuff will be the number-one power source for decades to come. Lately, though, chinks have appeared in the king's armor.
\
Most significant is the $45 billion bid by private equity firms to buy out TXU, the largest energy provider in Texas. The buyers have promised to spend more on energy efficiency, tie executive pay to environmental performance and cancel eight of 11 coal plants that the company currently plans to build. Western coal will feel the pain: The canceled plants would have burned millions of tons of coal from Wyoming's Powder River Basin.
\
Eight plants are just a drop in the bucket - some 150 coal plants, 37 of them in the West, are slated for construction in the next decade or so. But emboldened environmentalists and some analysts see the buyout's terms as the first step in a free-market retreat from coal that will ultimately result in the shelving of planned plants.
\
Coal took other hits recently:
\
* The Federal Railroad Administration denied a $2.3 billion loan for a new rail line that would move coal out of the Powder River Basin to power plants to the east. Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad officials won't give up yet; they're now looking for private investors. Two railroads already operate out of the basin, but utilities say the existing lines lack adequate coal-carrying capacity to keep up with demand.
\
* A bill in the New Mexico Legislature giving the proposed Desert Rock coal-fired power plant an $85 million tax-break appears doomed - the House nixed it and the Senate seems ready to do the same. Sithe Global, the plant's builder, claims it needs the break to avoid double taxation since it also will pay taxes to the Navajo Nation.
\
Frank Maisano, spokesman for Sithe and the energy industry group Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, says that losing the tax break will be ""hurtful"" but won't necessarily kill the plant. Meanwhile, he sees a bright future for coal, in spite of recent hitches: ""We're heavily reliant on coal to provide affordable electricity. If you have to have power in the short term, coal is the only way to get it, really.""
\
Divine Strake, the quasi-nuclear explosion scheduled for this spring in the Nevada desert, has been axed. The 700-ton pile of conventional explosives would have created a blast 70 times bigger than the largest conventional bomb in the U.S. arsenal. Citizens and politicians downwind of the blast opposed the test, saying it might kick radioactivity into the air that was left over from four decades of nuke tests.
\
Farmers in Colorado have had a hard time finding help lately thanks to federal raids and new state laws targeting undocumented immigrants. Now, the state Department of Corrections hopes to launch a pilot program to ease the labor shortage: Put prisoners - at a wage of 60 cents per day - to work in the fields.

41,"RobertMoore @coloradoan.com\Rep. Betsy Markey will need to go on the offensive against Republican Cory Gardner - and soon - if she hopes to win a second term, two Colorado State University political scientists said after a poll by a GOP-affiliated group showed the challenger with a comfortable lead.\""She does not have to hit him all by herself, assuming that there is outside help from the (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) or other groups, but she does have to hit him,"" CSU political science Chairman Bob Duffy said.\""And I think those hits have to start coming now, before the narrative takes hold that Gardner is a shoo-in.""\Gardner, a state representative from Yuma, leads Markey 50-39 percent, according to a poll of 400 likely 4th Congressional District voters conducted Aug. 23-26 and Aug. 28 for the American Action Forum, which is headed by former Minnesota Republican Sen. Norm Coleman and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Sen. John McCain's economic adviser in the 2008 presidential campaign. Margin of error for the survey, the results of which were released late Wednesday, is listed at plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\""Being a rubber stamp for Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama's failed economic policies and health-care takeover has taken a heavy toll on Betsy Markey,"" Gardner spokeswoman Rachel Boxer said.\Markey campaign spokesman Ben Marter said: ""The more people hear about Representative Gardner, the less they trust him. He can't run from his hypocrisy or his outrageous special interest-driven record forever.""\Candidates and independent groups have 60 days remaining to persuade voters. That short timeframe narrows Markey's options, CSU political scientist Kyle Saunders said.\""It's very hard to get favorable ratings to rise in this environment for your own campaign or by allied groups,"" Saunders said. ""The only solution is to go after the opponent and increase his negatives and define him. In that, it is going to get very, very ugly, assuming all of the affiliated groups for Markey are in this to the end.""\In the American Action Forum poll, 37 percent of respondents had a favorable impression of Markey and 50 percent had an unfavorable impression. For Gardner, 43 percent of voters said they'd never heard of him and 21 percent said they had no opinion. Twenty-three percent had a favorable opinion and 13 percent unfavorable.\About 55 percent of those who said they would vote for Gardner also said they never heard of him or had no opinion of him, according to the data. That could present Markey and her allies with an opening to soften Gardner's support if they start running ads that give voters a negative impression of him, Saunders said.\Gardner has only been subjected to one negative advertising campaign so far, a commercial in June by the abortion-rights group EMILY's List that challenged his legislative votes on health issues.\The poll was conducted as a group called Americans for Prosperity was running an anti-Markey ad criticizing some of her votes.\The American Action Forum poll has a couple of characteristics that likely will draw criticism.\The poll asked voters only about the two major party candidates, Markey and Gardner, and excluded two other candidates on the ballot, Doug Aden of the American Constitution Party and independent candidate Ken ""Wasko"" Waszkiewicz.\The firm that conducted the poll - Ayres, McHenry & Associates - identifies itself as a Republican firm. It drew the survey sample from voter lists rather than randomly drawn phone numbers, a practice that's controversial in polling circles because such lists can be outdated and excludes people with unlisted phone numbers from participating in the survey.\The poll included fewer Republicans than the actual electorate. Thirty-three percent of poll respondents identified themselves as Republican; they make up about 40 percent of the district's registered voters.\Twenty-seven percent of poll respondents identified themselves as Democrats, matching their voter registration numbers in the district. Thirty-seven percent of respondents called themselves independents; they make up 33 percent of district registered voters.\The AAF poll is the first one in the 4th Congressional District to be made public this year.\More from the poll\Other key findings from American Action Forum poll in Colorado's 4Congressional District:\> Thirty-five percent of voters said Betsy Markey deserved re-election and 56 percent said it was time for someone else to hold the seat.\> Sixty-eight percent of district voters think the country is on the wrong track, and only 25 percent think it's on the right track.\> In an open-ended question, 52 percent of voters cited the economy and jobs as the most important issue facing the country.\> Fifty-five percent of voters oppose the health-care reform bill passed into law earlier this year, compared to 38 percent who supported the bill. Markey voted for the final version of the bill in March after voting against a different version in November.\> Fifty-two percent of voters had an unfavorable impression of President Barack Obama and 42 percent favorable. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a 28 percent favorable rating and a 62 percent unfavorable rating.\> Markey's votes in favor of the health-care bill, stimulus bill and cap-and-trade energy legislation hurt her standing with district voters."

Even before President Barack Obama took the stage for his victory speech Tuesday night, environmentalists were laying out their expectations for his second term: act on climate change, whether it's through sweeping legislative action, regulatory rules or decisions like blocking the Keystone XL pipeline.
\
Just minutes after the race was called Tuesday, the group 350.org announced a Keystone XL protest on Nov. 18. Young climate activists who joined the celebration outside the White House held up a sign saying ""Sandy Demands Climate Action Now,"" a reference to the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy.
\
One line in Obama's victory speech gave the green groups hope that he might act.
\
""We want our children to live in an America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet,"" the president said.
\
But taking action to achieve those goals isn't going to be easy. While more than a dozen legislators targeted by environmental groups for their votes on clean energy and climate change bills were defeated in the election, neither chamber switched parties. With the status quo likely to continue in Congress, environmental groups say they'll pressure the White House to continue, or amplify, its work of the last four years.
\
There's even a push for Obama to take a larger role on the world's stage. In a statement congratulating Obama, a spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the secretary general looks forward to working with the president on ""tackling the challenges posed by climate change,"" among other issues.
\
Obama's biggest challenge, however, will be getting legislation through Congress. Many environmental groups expect that, given Republican opposition in the House, the administration will continue using its regulatory authority to pass environmentally friendly regulations. In Obama's first term, the Environmental Protection Agency set the first greenhouse gas limits on new power plants, proposed the first national standard for mercury from coal facilities and bolstered fuel economy rules for passenger vehicles.
\
By the end of the year the EPA also is expected to release a rule that would limit pollution from existing power plants and refineries. Before the election, there were reports that the EPA was trying to push the power plant rule out quickly, in case Mitt Romney won the presidency.
\
""For the next couple of months, we expect to see the EPA just finishing the business at hand. Chief among that is addressing pollution from power plants and what waters can be regulated under the Clean Water Act,"" said David Goldston, senior adviser to the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund.
\
In a second term, the EPA could consider rules governing coal ash waste and ground-level pollution, analysts say.
\
Groups that generally oppose action on climate change are, like the environmental groups, girding for what might be coming from the White House.
\
""This election really didn't change much in terms of the dynamic in Washington in the sense that President Obama stays in the White House and Congress stays the same,"" said James Taylor, senior fellow for environmental policy for the Heartland Institute, a noted climate skeptic group. ""So we'll probably just see this battle where EPA is taking severe measures and a different path than Congress might have taken.""
\
Eric Pooley, senior vice president for strategy and communications for the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), said his group already plans to push the federal and state governments to look beyond carbon and address ""climate accelerants"" like methane and refrigerants. On methane, Pooley said, that means addressing potential leakage from natural gas extraction.
\
EDF has been criticized by some green groups for supporting hydraulic fracturing, the controversial gas extraction method, albeit with restrictions. But Pooley said it's important to use natural gas as a bridge fuel and to ensure that the extraction is as safe and clean as possible, which requires federal leadership. The EPA is studying fracking, but it's unclear if any regulation will come out of that research.
\
Like most of Washington, environmental groups will be watching how Obama deals with Congress on the approaching fiscal cliff. If a budget deal isn't reached to reduce the national debt, across-the-board cuts through the budgetary sequester could go into effect in January with potentially dire consequences for the environment, they say.
\
The sequester could mean the closure of some National Parks, the elimination of some National Wildlife Refuges and cuts to coastal management programs, according to a fact sheet assembled by NRDC, The Wilderness Society, Defenders of Wildlife and the National Parks Conservation Association.
\
""The environmental community has a lot at stake. ... Sequestration could cripple environmental programs now and into the future,"" said NRDC Action's Goldston.
\
Goldston said a deal should include raising money by cutting subsidies for, ""industries that are mature, wealthy and produce pollutants.""
\
Environmental groups say the Democrats' slightly expanded majority in the Senate offers some hope for extending the wind production tax credit for renewable energy. They predict the industry will face layoffs and other setbacks if the credit is allowed to expire at the end of the year.
\
The EDF's Pooley said the administration should at least start a conversation about instituting a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system.
\
""Ultimately, if you're serious about cutting carbon emissions, you've got to price it,"" Pooley said.

Bill Ritters memo to state department heads to eliminate the least efficient and effective programs should be directed at his own pet programs (Ritter, lawmakers try to bridge $384m chasm, The Gazette, June 26). Ritter could eliminate millions of dollars by cutting his subsidies for solar and wind energy which are much less efficient than coal, oil and natural gas.\He could also increase revenues from oil and gas leasing and royalties by supporting drilling and oil shale. His opposition to drilling reduced state revenues, and his green energy initiatives have increased costs.\Dick Standaert\Colorado Springs\Give parks a price break\During the 2001-02 drought, a two tier system of payment to Colorado Springs Utilities was applied. Lower water rates usually charged from November to May were charged to the city to water parks to literally save grass from burning. This lower rate helped save City Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Services grounds from total devastation.\It was Councilman Scott Hente who recently suggested Utilities again charge City Parks the winter water rates to allow watering of parks thus preventing damage to parks, saving $800,000 to $1 million. This would keep city pools and parks systems alive and well.\We as a city have bitten the bullet before. The above appears to be a reasonable and feasible solution for the good of the city. City Council members should consider the two-tier switch again and place this on the council agenda in July.\Daisy Chun Rhodes\Friends of Aquatics?Colorado Springs\Congress happy to extend reach\The science is settled: Human induced global warming is an absolute farce. Of course if your knowledge of the subject is derived from a few headlines in The Gazette or what you heard on CNN or the Discovery Channel, you may think otherwise. Dig a little deeper and you will find a wealth of information that will convince all but the irrational that human-induced global warming is a scam.\The purpose of the scam is to expand the power of government.\There are two categories of global warming advocates. The first includes ideological environmentalists who never let reason get in the way of a good crusade to throttle human progress.\With global warming they have the perfect environmental catastrophe. Any change in the environment is now alleged to be the result of human activity.\The second category includes all those who will benefit from the expansion of government through environmental regulation. Federally funded scientists, educators and non-profit advocacy groups are in this category. Large corporations which benefit by their superior ability to cover the cost of regulatory compliance are in this group.\But the happiest campers of all will be the 535 members of the U.S. Congress who will have plenty of political favors to peddle for campaign contributions and trips to Bermuda if a cap-and-trade bill is passed. They are truly, as P.J. ORourke said, a Parliament of Whores.\Jerry Varner\Colorado Springs\Widen roads to save money\Heres a suggestion CDOT may want to consider for increasing the longevity of our states roads and saving significant dollars on paving costs.\By widening the roads a couple of feet and alternating the location of pavement striping over time, one can nearly double the life of our states pavements by spreading the tire wear tracks across a greater width of the roadway.\Lawrence M. Reisinger\Colorado Springs\Post Office is out of control\I wonder if others have sent packages the Post Office never delivered. This has happened to me three times. Last week I went to the Post Office on Eighth Street to inquire about a package I sent on June 10 that never arrived at its destination. The clerk I spoke with said unless it had a tracking number there was nothing he could do. I asked if perhaps a postal employee would steal a package that wasnt insured. He said, Well, anybody will steal.\He said he remembered asking me if I wanted a tracking number when I mailed packages before and I had refused. I had never mailed a package through him and I remember the ones who had waited on me when I did mail my packages. I asked how much it cost for a tracking number, and he said $5.25. The package I sent was small and very light, and it cost $7.50 to mail. I asked to speak to a manager, and he said the branch manager was busy but he would have her call me. She never did.\My package contained a needlepoint tote bag made by my 99-year-old stepmother who died last month. I am much saddened by its loss.\My other lost packages contained an expensive silk dress for the recipient to wear to a wedding, and the third had important and irreplaceable papers.\What would a tracking number do except tell where a package was stolen? And why must we pay so much on top of postage to try to ensure our packages are delivered? From now on, I shall mail all packages through UPS, and I encourage everyone to do the same.\Helen Krieger\Colorado Springs"
44,"Fracking starts to look pretty good\Recent articles on the fracking controversy reminded me of a visit I had from a young activist several months ago seeking my signature on a petition to restrict fracking in Colorado. I told him no thanks and he asked me why. I replied, because I care about the environment.\The answer was flippant but also true. In 2012, the U.S. became the first major industrialized nation to meet its Kyoto emissions target without having signed the treaty. The lion's share of that reduction was due to the substitution of natural gas for coal in power generation as gas prices fell by 82 percent from 2008 to 2012 and proven reserves rose dramatically. That increase in supply was entirely due to shale gas and the advent of hydraulic fracturing.\Without doubt, some of the gains in carbon reduction resulted from regulatory pressure against the use of ""dirty"" fuels, particularly coal. But, as Europe has discovered, regulations make little difference in the face of hard facts. The European Union's vaunted cap and trade program is failing in the face of real world demands and a coal based energy economy. The allowed carbon emissions allotted to companies by EU policymakers (referred to as ""pollution permits"") has ballooned, dropping the effective tax on emissions 86 percent from 2008 to 2013. In other words, it's now 86 percent cheaper to ""pollute"" in Europe than it was five years ago.\Through American ingenuity and fortuitous good luck, the U.S. (and the rest of the world, if it follows suit) has been given about a 30 year window of a relatively clean energy in which to develop environmentally sustainable technologies into economically sustainable realities. Obviously, there are risks and contamination issues have to be studied, monitored and rigorously controlled or eliminated. But that's doable. Given the alternative of rapidly worsening global warming or economic suicide, fracking starts to look pretty good.\Tim Beeson, Manitou Springs\-\Parents can opt out of tests\A Jan. 10 memo from Joyce Zurkowski, Assessment Department, Colorado Department of Education to all Colorado school superintendents contains false and misleading information concerning parents who opt their child out of standardized tests. She quotes Colorado Statute [22-7-409(1.2)(d)(1)(A)], ""as part of the school and district accountability system, every student enrolled in a public school is required to take the state assessments.""\Statute [22-7-409(1.2)(d)(1)(A)]is an educational statute regulating Colorado school districts. It was written so districts would not omit students who may test low and therefore inflate their average score. This law does not pertain to parent's right to opt their child out of standardized tests. Further evidence that the law does not regulate parent's opt out rights is that there is no mention of penalties to parents who choose not to allow their children to be tested. In fact, parents are not even mentioned in the over 500 pages of the statute.\Schools may be required to test all students, but there is no law requiring the parents to allow their children to be tested. It is interesting that CDE does not even enforce the law. CDE regulations concerning TCAP tests require school districts to test at least ""95% of the children.""\The memo also claims, ""Schools and districts not meeting the participation requirements drop one full category on the Performance Frameworks.""\However, Jo O'Brien, Assistant Commissioner of Standards, Colorado Department of Education said during an interview, ""The Education Accountability Act of 2009 (SB 09-163) repealed previous SAR law. Negative weights for Unsatisfactory and No Score percentages are not in effect anymore . Students who do not test, including those who do so due to parental refusal, are counted as non-participants when determining participation rates for state and federal accountability purposes. For calculating performance, non-participant data are not counted as zeroes - they are excluded from the calculation . So the calculations are performed on the basis solely of students that took the test and had valid scores on it.""\The last item of the memo stated, ""Since all students are required to take state assessments, schools are not required to provide alternate activities.""\Since this answer is based on item number one, it is invalid, as is item number one.\George J Saiter Ed.D., Denver\Credit: Letters"

That could present Markey and her allies with an opening to soften Gardner's support if they start running ads that give voters a negative impression of him, Saunders said.\Gardner has only been subjected to one negative advertising campaign so far, a commercial in June by the abortion-rights group EMILY's List that challenged his legislative votes on health issues.\The poll was conducted as a group called Americans for Prosperity was running an anti-Markey ad criticizing some of her votes.\The American Action Forum poll has a couple of characteristics that likely will draw criticism.\The poll asked voters only about the two major party candidates, Markey and Gardner, and excluded two other candidates on the ballot, Doug Aden of the American Constitution Party and independent candidate Ken ""Wasko"" Waszkiewicz.\The firm that conducted the poll - Ayres, McHenry & Associates - identifies itself as a Republican firm. It drew the survey sample from voter lists rather than randomly drawn phone numbers, a practice that's controversial in polling circles because such lists can be outdated and excludes people with unlisted phone numbers from participating in the survey.\The poll included fewer Republicans than the actual electorate. Thirty-three percent of poll respondents identified themselves as Republican; they make up about 40 percent of the district's registered voters.\Twenty-seven percent of poll respondents identified themselves as Democrats, matching their voter registration numbers in the district. Thirty-seven percent of respondents called themselves independents; they make up 33 percent of district registered voters.\The AAF poll is the first one in the 4th Congressional District to be made public this year.\More from the poll\Other key findings from American Action Forum poll in Colorado's 4Congressional District:\> Thirty-five percent of voters said Betsy Markey deserved re-election and 56 percent said it was time for someone else to hold the seat.\> Sixty-eight percent of district voters think the country is on the wrong track, and only 25 percent think it's on the right track.\> In an open-ended question, 52 percent of voters cited the economy and jobs as the most important issue facing the country.\> Fifty-five percent of voters oppose the health-care reform bill passed into law earlier this year, compared to 38 percent who supported the bill. Markey voted for the final version of the bill in March after voting against a different version in November.\> Fifty-two percent of voters had an unfavorable impression of President Barack Obama and 42 percent favorable. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a 28 percent favorable rating and a 62 percent unfavorable rating.\> Markey's votes in favor of the health-care bill, stimulus bill and cap-and-trade energy legislation hurt her standing with district voters."

The economy has been stuck in first gear going on 5 years now since the great recession, and the outlook is for the same. Technology has eliminated many toll booth and grocery store checker jobs and soon we'll grab i-Pads to order when we enter a restaurant. Additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) bodes well for new online businesses, but not too well for those seeking manufacturing jobs. Even a new steel plant in Youngstown, Ohio (my place of birth), built to fabricate pipe used for natural gas drilling in the Marcellus and Utica Shale basins, will provide far fewer manufacturing jobs than originally anticipated due to automation. So, where are all of our unemployed workers going to find jobs? Sorry, the outlook isn't good and conventional manufacturing jobs are not coming back the United States.
\
At the same time, the world is warming, sea level is rising and we are experiencing catastrophic storms, flooding, drought and raging fires. Many believe that fossil fuel use for power and transportation is the greatest source of greenhouse gases that cause global warming. Others argue that the global warming is a cycle of nature. No matter which side of that argument you are on, you should certainly be alarmed that earlier this year Beijing's Air Quality Index hit a recent memory all time high of AQI = 755! This pollution is far off-the-chart and would trigger health warnings in the U.S. of emergency conditions. It travels around the globe in the jet stream for everyone to experience. Yet, nobody should expect significant government funds to mitigate climate change -- especially with an economy that we have now.
\
We need a way to employ many of the currently unemployed and the new job seekers, while developing a long-term plan to combat global climate change. There is no doubt that a major infrastructure stimulus-type government program is needed to get multitudes of people back to work -- fixing roads and bridges, putting power lines below ground and improving transportation, maybe even light and fast rail where it makes sense. We need to improve support for our educational system and to increase funding for long-term basic science research -- which has led to platform technologies creating more high-technology jobs. With entitlements and defense spending being protected, funding will have to come from increased broad-brush tax increases and expanded tax revenue driven by job creation. So, how do we do that? How do we ""jump-start"" our economy while finding additional revenue to employ millions of Americans, and increase spending on education and research?
\
Our citizens and elected officials need to compromise, find common ground and move forward quickly. Knowing that the best ""deal"" is one where nobody is happy, we need to make concessions for the good of our country and our children. There should be some agreement between the two parties in Washington where the President approves the XL pipeline and opens up some of our federal lands for oil and gas drilling in exchange for a broad carbon tax, a Value Added Tax (VAT) that is focused on the reduction of greenhouse gas generation (GHG). This would improve the economy with more energy jobs, allow us to be an exporter of refined gas/oil products, reduce our dependency on Middle Eastern oil and reduce the local concerns over ""fracking"" in cities and near more populated areas (if more drilling is opened up elsewhere); while at the same time incentivizing entrepreneurial risk takers to create ""green"" jobs. Further, the Canadian tar sands oil will ultimately be developed and none of us wants the pollution that would come out of transporting crude to China and refining there.
\
The U.S. emits 5.5 billion metric tons (mt) of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually. A $30/mt carbon tax would generate $165 billion a year. What would this tax affect? Coal fired electricity costs would be taxed at $0.03 (3 cents) per kW-hr used, natural gas fired at about half that ($0.015/kW-hr used) and wind/solar at near zero. Burning a gallon of gasoline would be taxed at $0.25/gallon. Of course, this tax should be applied globally in order to level the economic playing field. With the vast satellite imagery available, it is well-known where the GHGs are produced. Imports could be taxed based on their GHG emissions at the originating country of export. If this starts a trade war, so be it. I'm sure the Europeans, Japanese, Australians and many others would be supportive. There is no doubt that the lack of environmental and safety regulation in China has contributed substantially to the current economic imbalance and is now threatening global environment and health. The revenue generated by the GHG VAT could be used partially for reducing the debt and partially for supporting an infrastructure-type jobs, education and research program.
\
The free market would determine the winners and the losers. There would be no need for special credits, like wind, since the VAT would provide the incentive to be clean. Likewise, there would be no selecting winners like Solyndra, since the free market would dictate what technologies are best. ""Green"" habits would be rewarded while dirtier habits penalized. New ""green"" manufacturing jobs would be created. The VAT tax collected at the point of consumption is the best means of insuring that those funds are used as prescribed. We don't need anyone ""gaming"" a cap and trade program in which a large fraction of the tax would end up on the balance sheets of big banks.
\
How do we get there? We can start by having those citizens who are intent to ban ""fracking"" to direct their energies to putting a carbon tax in place as a compromise. At the same time, those citizens who are against broad government taxation should be pushing for approval of the XL pipeline and drilling on public lands as a compromise to the carbon tax. If the President flat out rejects the XL pipeline, it would be a lost opportunity for negotiating something that is a win-win. The same is true if he flat out approves it. Details would have to be worked out and a global carbon tax phased in, but this would be one giant leap in the right direction for our kid's futures. And remember, the best ""deal"" is one where nobody is happy.

47,"
The biggest piece of environmental legislation in decades - the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 - might have been ""of 2008,"" or been passed in various forms even earlier, were it not for Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn.
\
The Omnibus Act bundled 164 conservation efforts into a massive package that designated 2 million acres of new wilderness and increased the wild and scenic river system by 50 percent. It helped enable buyouts of oil and gas leases in Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National Forest and ratified wilderness deals that were negotiated on the ground in Idaho's Owyhee County and Utah's Washington County. Many Western environmentalists, ranchers, county officials and other stakeholders were involved in creating the Omnibus.
\
But the act itself can be blamed on Coburn, which is why it's known around Capitol Hill as ""Tbmnibus."" ""What he did was put holds on virtually every bill that came out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee,"" says Paul Spitler, a high-ranking Wilderness Society staffer based in Washington, D. C. Coburn blocked so many individual bills in 2008 that supporters decided to lump them together into the omnibus package in early 2009, hoping to pass all 164 measures at once. They succeeded, but not without a fight.
\
At Coburn's insistence, the Omnibus Act was ""read (on the Senate floor) until the wee hours of the morning, which dragged out the timeline for an extra day,"" says Spitler. ""And at that point, he said, 'OK, you guys can go home now.'""
\
Coburn again drew the ire of Western environmentalists in September, by holding up passage of five popular wildlife-protection bills, one of which - the Crane Conservation Act - was sponsored by a fellow Republican, Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo. Oregon's Sen. Jeff Merkley, California's Sen. Barbara Boxer and Washington's Sen. Maria Cantwell - all Western Democrats - were also among the five bills' sponsors. Probably the most popular one would have banned the ""animal crush videos"" that Wayne Pacelle, head of the Humane Society of the United States, describes as ""the vile depictions of staged scenes in which scantily clad women maim and torture animals for the sexual gratification of viewers."" Coburn said those bills were a distraction at a time when the Senate should be addressing the deficit.
\
""One can understand Sen. Coburn's interest in fiscal restraint,"" Pacelle wrote in his Humane Society blog. ""But in his case, it is an obsession, and it borders on a mania.""
\
Stories like this justify Coburn's nickname, which plays off his medical degree and the name of the villain in an old James Bond movie: ""Dr. No."" And ""No"" might as well be the middle name of Oklahoma's other ultraconservative senator, James Mountain lnhofe. Both have used their Senate tenures largely for one purpose: Obstruction. They're effective advocates for the causes they believe in, slowing or stopping legislation and regulations they oppose. They've also attracted national attention by taking contrarian, often-controversial stances, and by giving a prominent voice to beliefs that are far out of the mainstream. They help give extremism credibility.
\
Ihofe has spent much of his career working to undermine or totally dismantle environmental protections. As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee from 2003 to early 2007, he often held hearings that were more like kangaroo courts. In one 2003 hearing on climate change, he pitted two climate-change deniers against one scientist representing the mainstream view. That summer he held a similarly biased hearing on mercury pollution: A lone voice expressed the majority view that mercury is toxic and regulations are needed on the power plants that release 48 tons of airborne mercury every year, while two experts testified in favor of the opposite view. The Bush administration subsequently moved to dramatically weaken Clintonera mercury regulations, a rollback later defeated in federal court.
\
Ihofe also opposes efforts to protect polar bears by limiting the carbon emissions that cause climate change, denouncing them as ""an attack on our economy and our energy security."" As a leading climate-change denier, he's worked to block any significant action on the problem, including the environmentalists' best hope - the cap-and-trade bill that died earlier this year - even as climate change threatens the West, contributing to drought, a forest beetle crisis and record-breaking wildfires.
\
Ihofe saves some of his hottest rage for the Environmental Protection Agency, which he's called ""a Gestapo bureaucracy."" In 2006, when EPA staffers based in Denver went into natural gas fields with infra-red cameras to detect pollution, lnhofe attacked the agency and tried to pressure the employees to back off In 2009, he called for a criminal investigation into the EPA, charging it with suppressing evidence that climate change doesn't amount to much. ""They've been cooking that science since 1998,"" he told Fox News.
\
""He seems to really have a longterm vendetta against the EPA,"" says Scott Thomasson, domestic policy director for the Progressive Policy Institute, a moderate left-of-center think tank. ""(It's) so deeply ingrained at this point that he has a presumption of incompetence and malice about everything that they do.""
\
Meanwhile, Coburn, a longtime friend of the National Rifle Association, used legislative trickery to make it legal to carry loaded guns in national parks, despite the strong opposition of the National Park Service. He slipped the amendment into the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights Act of 2009.
\
Earlier this year, Coburn blocked Senate approval of a $3.4 billion payment to Native Americans to settle a class-action lawsuit over the Department of Interior's longtime mismanagement of mineral royalties on tribal lands. (That case is not yet settled.) In 2009, he tried to block Senate confirmation of Hilary Tbmpkins, a Stanfordeducated New Mexico Navajo, as the top lawyer in Obama's Interior Department. (The Senate eventually confirmed Tbmpkins.) In 2008, he opposed a sweeping $35 billion improvement of the Indian Health Service, even though many Western senators of both parties backed it and a total of 83 senators voted for it.
\
Both of the Oklahoma senators strongly support the oil and gas industry. They've repeatedly backed federal subsidies and sought to increase drilling, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, while resisting tougher regulations, fuel efficiency and conservation measures. lnhofe led the fight to carve out an exemption in the Safe Drinking Water Act for ""tracking"" - the high-pressure pumping of chemicals to free up natural gas in underground formations, a process many Westerners believe threatens water quality. This theme of the senators' influence is felt every day in Western states where drillers are constantly claiming more of the landscape.
\
According to the League of Conservation Voters, during his terms in the U.S. Senate and House, Coburn has voted against environmentalists' positions from 87 to 100 percent of the time, depending on which session you focus on. lnhofe has voted against environmentalists 96 to 100 percent of the time. That's another way the Oklahoma ""nos"" are heard around the West.
"
48," FEELING THE HEAT?\ Cost of doing nothing higher than addressing issue\ I have been reading with great interest and baffled amusement the debate between readers on the issue of climate change. Even the term ""climate change"" has been a source of contention about whether or not the current rise in global temperatures can be attributed to humans. The fact is that 99 percent of the scientific community agrees that humans have been increasing the concentrations of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into our atmosphere. The correlation between increases in these gases and increases of atmospheric temperature is also accepted.\ Current concentrations of these gases are higher than at any point in the last 800,000 years. If we do nothing to reduce CO2 emissions, the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere will rise from 381 parts per million today to almost 1,000 ppm in the next 100 years. Since 1860, we have seen CO2 levels rise from 290 ppm to 381 ppm with an increase in global temperatures of 1 degree Fahrenheit. If we allow concentration to reach 1,000 ppm it is very likely that temperatures will increase by another 6 to 9 degrees F on average.\ The mistake many people seem to be making is that they don't believe there is a cost to doing nothing. Are they going to foot the tax bill for hundreds of miles of sea wall to hold back the rising seas? Are they going to be willing to pay exorbitant prices for water as our snowpack continues to decline and become less reliable?\ The critics (including The Gazette) claim it would cost our economy too much to change our current energy policy to reduce emissions of CO2. If we do nothing, the costs to our economy will be far greater than if we had been proactive rather than reactive to climate change.\ Ask yourself why you have health insurance, homeowners insurance or car insurance. In case the unthinkable happens, right? Look at changing our policies regarding energy consumption and transportation as an insurance policy against what would be an unthinkable global disaster.\ Eric Billmeyer\ Manitou Sorings\ There's no crisis yet, but climate change is coming\ I am responding to the Feb. 14 letter expressing disenchantment with global warming alarmists who guarantee a looming disaster (""Climate change 'crisis' needs dose of perspective""). I was suspicious that doomsday environmentalists had tainted the data to compel us to use alternative energies that offer less tangible impact upon the land. I read several articles and eight books addressing this issue from various viewpoints, the best of which were ""The Skeptical Environment"" and ""Red Sky at Morning."" I concluded that global warming is probably a slow-moving catastrophe. I cannot say with absolute certainty, but we make decisions based on the probability of risk.\ I also found that there are doomsday predictions from global warming skeptics: that the economy is inherently damaged by any government intervention. These alarmists sought to block a cap-and- trade system in the early 1990s to minimize sulphur dioxide, which is a contributor to acid rain. The 1990s witnessed a 37 percent reduction of sulphur dioxide through this system while the economy grew, giving hope that a similar program could mitigate the generally negative consequences of climate change while allowing for economic growth.\ Todd Nelson\ Colorado Springs\ Real-world alternatives not waiting in the wings\ I have enjoyed reading all of the recent editorials, columns and letters offering views on global warming. However, I think The Gazette should consider limiting inputs to authors with at least one foot in a reality-based universe. The Feb. 18 letter, ""Energy innovation stifled in drive for profits,"" was a prime example of one by a reality-challenged author.\ Dean Wallace started off by declaring that the objections of warming skeptics are not fueled by facts, and then stated, ""Think of the money we'd save if we never had to go to the gas station again. It's possible. Internal combustion engines and coalfired electric plants are old technologies."" That may sound great, but here in the real world, we just don't have an economically viable alternative to fossil-fueled transportation. The reason we have a gasoline-powered transportation system is that it is the least expensive and most efficient. You can dream about ethanol, biodiesel etc., but these will only contribute on the margins and cost more than gasoline.\ The same goes for coal-fired power plants.\ I almost forgot my favorite line: ""Innovation has been stifled by profits for too long."" If there were great innovations out there that were scientifically and economically feasible (not one that just made people feel better about using them), don't you think someone would be putting them forward? Note that Toyota makes lots of money selling fuel-efficient autos while GM and Ford lose money selling gas-guzzlers. In the real world, real innovation equals profit, and ideas have to actually work before they are implemented on a large scale.\ I fully support reducing carbon dioxide emissions and our dependence on foreign oil. It seems to me that nuclear power helps in both areas. Yes there are issues, but it is technologically and economically viable on a scale large enough to make a difference in the real world. Maybe I would be a little less skeptical of those preaching global warming doom if just one of them acknowledged nuclear power as a potential part of the solution.\ John Bowers\ Monument\ GOVERNMENT SPENDING\ 25 percent of incomes should be enough for taxes\ We need to consider a constitutional amendment which would place a reasonable limit on government spending. Without any limit, our public officials tend to increase spending in order to satisfy their particular constituency -- to be elected or to remain in office.\ More government spending suggests higher taxes. Some say: tax the rich, and thereby benefit the poor and middle class. That is the more liberal, socialist view, which is to provide more economic ""equality."" The harm that more often arises, however, is that when you increase a tax on the rich, the poor may suffer the most. When you raise taxes on landlords and businessmen, they raise the rent and prices, which burdens us all -- mostly the poor (who consume most of their incomes).\ As Milton Friedman noted, government spending is the real tax burden imposed on us, whether financed by direct taxes, debt, or a debased currency (inflation).\ I suggest Congress consider a specified limit on the piece of our economic pie that it spends. The task of our representatives would be to work within that limit, setting priorities and cutting spending on less-essential projects.\ How much should our federal, state and local governments spend? One Readers Digest poll suggested that 25 percent of our total income (or GDP) was a reasonable amount. Our government now spends 37 percent to 38 percent. Isn't that a big enough helping (perhaps too much)?\ Finally, let me note that our future growth depends in great part on the growth of our private sector. That growth, in turn, depends on the income (savings to invest) that our private sector has available now, left after taxes.\ Stanley J. Miedich\ Professor of finance, retired\ Colorado Springs\ GASSING UP\ Look at full costs before switching to E85\ I read the article about more E85 stations coming soon (""3 more area sites to sell E85 fuel,"" Business, Feb. 18). Before rushing out to change fuels, however, people must understand the impact on fuel economy.\ My SUV gets about 25 percent lower mileage with E85 than with gasoline. This means that E85 should cost no more than $1.50 a gallon to be the same value as $2-agallon gasoline. While there might be some greenhouse-gas benefits to E85, we are already paying an extra 50 cents per gallon for domestic ethanol in the form of tax subsidies. It is important to understand the costs and benefits before making a switch.\ Ed Storey\ Falcon"
49,"
Like all candidates in the coming general election, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Republican challenger Ken Buck, 51, are focused on the economy -- and although they have different takes on what will help end this recession, they have some similarities, too.
\
Bennet says government needs to overhaul regulations and the tax structure to help the economy thrive, while Buck says government cannot create jobs, but can get out of the way.
\
Legislators can construct policies which ""are worthy of our kids and grandkids,"" said Bennet, 45.
\
The aspirations that Americans share are much more important than the divided politics the nation has seen recently, he said.
\
Every generation wants its children to do better than it has, but the younger generation today is the first which has not done that, Bennet said.
\
Over the past decade, the economy grew, but household income did not, he said. Workers bring home the same pay they did when the decade began due to stagnant wages, but the cost of health care rose more than 100 percent and the cost of higher education went up by 60 percent or more.
\
In real spending terms, families earn less than they did at the beginning of the decade, Bennet said.
\
They need political leadership to follow, not political games, he said.
\
Buck, 51, said the federal government is out of control, with too many agencies interfering in too many parts of people's lives.
\
He wants to control spending and control regulatory agencies, he said.
\
The idea is to empower small business to create jobs by giving owners certainty of what will be happening with taxes, regulations, health care policy and the price of energy, Buck said.
\
Right now, business owners do not feel they can take any risks when they do not know what will happen next, he said.
\
Buck said he would make targeted tax cuts to small business and reduce capital gains taxes for corporations.
\
Not taxing their profits for a period of time will allow them to expand and create jobs, he said.
\
""That's the key,"" Buck said.
\
He would also cut back spending in general, he said.
\
Bennet would ""like to see us come to a decision to commit to making America the most competitive economy in the world.""
\
Not only does that mean overhauling the tax and regulatory structures, but it means the nation needs an energy independence policy which stops sending billions of dollars overseas to regimes which support terrorists, he said.
\
America also needs a compelling vision of how to pay down the deficit, Bennet said.
\
""Both parties are to blame for (the deficit),"" Bennet said.
\
As the economy recovers, politicians shouldn't just use up the revenue gains by spending money the country does not have or cutting taxes -- they should set funds aside to reduce the deficit, he said.
\
Bennet should know about the deficit, Buck said, since he voted for the stimulus bill, and the health care bill which Buck claims will raise the deficit. Bennet's voting record does not reflect his concern about the deficit, Buck said.
\
Spending should be the No. 1 issue, Buck said.
\
Government should not be spending money on organizations like the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for Humanities or Amtrak, he said.
\
Federal salaries are out of control, and the legislature could save $250 billion a year if they were cut, Buck said.
\
Buck said the spirit behind the Republican pledge that was recently released is good, but he said it does not go far enough.
\
He would like to see a constitutional balanced budget amendment, Buck said.
\
He would also like to do away with earmarks which set aside money for pet projects, he said.
\
Sometimes these projects are added to a legislative bill, although they are not related to the legislation. Earmarks reflect the corruption in Washington, D.C., Buck said.
\
Legislators should vote for a bill on its merits, not because there is something in it for them, he said.
\
That is why he would also vote for a page limit on bills and a requirement making bills about a single issue, Buck said.
\
He would also like to see bills made public at least 72 hours before they are voted on, he said.
\
Farm bill
\
Buck said he would have to study the farm bill before he could make any comments, but said the estate tax has to go.
\
Government should not prevent the next generation from taking over the family farm due to estate taxes when the family worked so hard over the years to make it profitable, he said.
\
Bennet said he would also like to see estate tax relief for small businesses and family farms.
\
He has a plan to raise the exemption limit from the current $5 million to $10 million, he said. That would protect nearly half of those who would otherwise pay an estate tax next year from paying any estate tax at all.
\
Bennet said he has fought hard on the agriculture committee to protect the interests of farmers and ranchers and will do the same on the 2012 Farm Bill.
\
Buck has said he opposes price supports for agriculture, Bennet said, but growers need supports to survive natural disasters or price swings.
\
Ag producers are some of the most important stewards of natural resources and need support, he said.
\
The rural economy is complex, and he has talked to some innovative people in rural areas who have to do many jobs to make ends meet, Bennet said.
\
They deserve government support to become thriving again and to attract young people to stay in rural areas, he said.
\
""It matters a lot to preserve a culture which is important to our heritage, economy and security,"" Bennet said.
\
Agriculture is important in keeping the food supply safe, and the U.S. should never become a net importer of food, he said. Instead, it should be a net exporter.
\
That is why he has worked so hard to make sure rural areas have access to funding for water, wastewater treatment, hospitals and broadband Internet access, Bennet said.
\
These help keep rural employers and workers competitive with the rest of the world, he said.
\
Cap and trade
\
Legislators have been working on a policy to limit the amount of greenhouse gases factories and other sources produce, and allowing companies to trade greenhouse gas credits if they reduce gases released by more than the limits or take other measures to decrease global warming.
\
In a proposed energy bill which has not passed yet, part of the plan is to encourage use of alternative energy sources which do not release greenhouse gases.
\
Buck says he is opposed to any such plan, because the government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers in the energy industry by supporting alternative, renewable energy companies.
\
Colorado has pushed for renewable energy development through laws requiring energy companies to use alternative energy for a certain percentage of their energy production, and Bennet supports this idea if it results in creating jobs,
\
He said he believes that a low-carbon, cleaner economy will add jobs, but he will not support any bill if it does not create jobs, Bennet said.
\
For instance, he did not support the U.S. House of Representatives Energy Bill, because he has no interest in any legislation which would stifle the economy.
\
Bennet said he believes that investing in renewable energy could create millions of jobs for America and thousands of jobs for Colorado, and supports renewable energy projects which have been successful in Colorado.
\
In fact, Colorado can lead the way for the rest of the nation with all it has done with natural gas, wind and sun power, he said.
\
Buck said he does not support what Colorado has done, and believes the Colorado legislature ought to be fighting for traditional energy development.
\
Colorado laws and regulations have held up oil and natural gas leases, and he would prefer to make drilling permits easier, Buck said.
\
Oil and natural gas companies have found it takes months or years to get leases, he said.
\
Alternative energy growth is critical and could lead to 20 percent job growth, Bennet said.
\
""We need those jobs,"" Bennet said.
\
Again, he does not support just any energy bill, but one which creates jobs, he said.
\
""I'm open to everybody's best ideas,"" Bennet said. ""We can figure out what the best way of getting it done is.""
\
If done right, alternative energy can also boost the rural economy, he said.
\
""I want to take a business approach to this, not a political approach,"" Bennet said.
\
Bennet
\
Bennet said he discovered that Washington, D.C., is full of career politicians who have never held a private sector job.
\
""I've never run for political office before,"" Bennet noted.
\
He was appointed to the U.S. Senate when one of the Colorado seats became vacant, and he was appointed as the superintendent for Denver Public Schools, but the rest of his life was in the private sector, he said.
\
Washington, D.C., has almost none of that kind of perspective, he said.
\
That means that by the time federal policy comes to Colorado, it makes no sense at all, as he experienced with his oversight of schools, Bennet said.
\
It also means that some actions do not make sense from a business perspective, he said.
\
For instance, he joined the U.S. Senate after the bank bailout, but he would have held out for some ""deal points,"" Bennet said.
\
Before becoming superintendent for Denver Public Schools, Bennet was a managing director of the Anschutz Investment Co., where he had responsibility for $500 million of investments.
\
He led the reorganization of distressed companies, and knows how to make deals with firms, Bennet said.
\
When he came to the U.S. Senate, he said that the money paid back to the federal government from the bank bailout should go to pay off part of the deficit, which is what happened, he said.
\
Bennet also voted to cap discretionary spending, he said.
\
One of the first things he did was to ask for a seat on the agriculture committee, because ag is a big part of the Colorado economy, and the lifeblood of rural communities, Bennet said.
\
He worked to extend access to credit for farmers and ranchers, especially those who were left helpless after the closing of the New Frontier Bank, he said.
\
He also advocated for getting conservation easements for Colorado after the program was cut, and that meant Colorado has more conservation acreage than any state other than Texas, Bennet said.
\
Bennet said he has also worked on opening up the Mexican market to American potatoes, and Asian markets for American beef.
\
He plans to use his influence to help make sure people are educated for the 21st century job market, and his experience could help, he said.
\
Bennet said the Republican pledge was just another example of Washington, D.C., politicians making good talking points but would only make the fiscal crisis worse.
\
""A lot of these ideas put us in the recession,"" Bennet said.
\
He wants to create a tax and regulatory environment which builds the most competitive economy in the world, he said.
\
""That's what our kids and grandkids expect us to do,"" Bennet said.
\
When he was confronted with a broken school district budget, he used his business restructuring experience to change the ways things were done, he said.
\
That's the kind of mindset he brings the nation's capital, Bennet said.
\
Buck
\
Buck says that Bennet has just rubber-stamped President Barack Obama's agenda.
\
He said he has proposals on the table to address spending issues, and he is a strict fiscal conservative.
\
Although he grew up on Ossining, N.Y., his father was raised in Greeley, and Buck would visit the area during the summer, he said.
\
Buck earned his undergraduate degree from Princeton University, and moved to Wyoming to work for the state legislative services office and earned a degree at the University of Wyoming School of Law.
\
Buck was hired by the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., and later joined the U.S. Attorney's Office in Denver.
\
He moved to Greeley in 1996 and was elected district attorney for Weld County in 2004.
\
Buck said he was proud of how he has worked with local law enforcement to reduce crime in the county by 50 percent.
\
That meant prosecuting offenders aggressively, but also helping to build programs helping young people, he said.
\
One of his favorite programs was one which gave substance abuse treatment to youths to help them get their lives back on track, Buck said. Like all candidates in the coming general election, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Republican challenger Ken Buck, 51, are focused on the economy -- and although they have different takes on what will help end this recession, they have some similarities, too.

50,"
""One of our most urgent projects is to develop a national energy policy. The United States is the only major industrial country without a comprehensive, long-range energy policy. Our program will emphasize conservation ... solar energy and other renewable energy sources.... we must face the fact that the energy shortage is permanent. There is no way we can solve it quickly. But if we all cooperate and make modest sacrifices ... we can find ways to adjust.""
\
Imagine those words spoken by the next president shortly after taking office on Jan. 20, 2009, continuing a theme originally established on the campaign trail. The words seem to be aimed directly at Westerners: ""If we wait, and do not act, then ... we will feel mounting pressure to plunder the environment. We will have a crash program to build more nuclear plants, strip-mine and burn more coal, and drill more (oil and gas) wells.... Intense competition will build up among ... the different regions within our own country.""
\
The president concludes: ""If you will join me so that we can work together with patriotism and courage, we will again prove that our great nation can lead the world into an age of peace, independence and freedom.
\
""This difficult effort will be the moral equivalent of war except that we will be uniting our efforts to build and not destroy.""
\
Inspiring and timely, indeed. But doesn't it sound kind of familiar? It should. The president who made those speeches did so 30 years ago. His name was Jimmy Carter.
\
When Carter tried to rally the nation during the first energy crisis, he understood that the West would be the key region in the effort. His policies weren't perfect - he pushed oil shale, for instance - but at least he had an overarching vision. It's been a long time since a president, or even a major presidential candidate, spoke so directly to our region and our fundamental issues.
\
Today, amid another energy crisis - with prices soaring, another rush to squeeze out the West's fossil fuels, and military ventures overseas related to our hunger for oil - we need a president who can address the issue in an inspiring and substantial manner. We need a leader to blaze a path toward real and lasting progress on energy.
\
So far in this election cycle, we have no such presidential candidate. Even in their much-ballyhooed debates in Nevada and California - where they were supposed to discuss Western issues - the candidates talked mostly of generic issues like Iraq and health insurance. Their debates and speeches are as relevant to New Jersey as to New Mexico - probably more so. Even the Western candidates in the race, such as Arizona Sen. John McCain, speak more to a national audience than to Westerners.
\
They need to change their tune. Though candidates have been able to ignore the West in the past, it's high time to take us seriously. Every year, the West's burgeoning population means more votes; every year, the region becomes more diverse, independent and politically mature. The old political patterns are breaking down; we're no longer just a Republican stronghold in the interior with Democratic bastions on the coasts. We've become a political battlefield, and that means well have a much greater voice in choosing the next president.
\
Western voters will respond to those candidates who understand that we have our own concerns and unique issues that need to be addressed by the next president.
\
Since no actual candidate has done so, High Country News has written the kind of campaign speech that we, as Westerners, would like to hear. It doesn't cover all the issues that the region cares about - no single speech could do that. Instead, like Carter's speech, it focuses on the one issue that has the most impact on our economies, cultures, communities and landscapes. A talented speechwriter might add a few jokes or anecdotes, perhaps insert a folksy Western twang, but this speech concentrates on the important points.
\
And it would work pretty well across the board in the West, from meetings of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association or the Sierra Club to the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce.
\
""Thank you, Westerners, for Showing Up. I address you as Westerners because you're part of a community that stretches from the Dakotas to New Mexico and west tO the Pacific. Your community has many divisions and conflicts, but you're unified by distinctive regional traits.
\
""You have the greatest open spaces, the most majestic scenery and wildlife, almost all the federal public lands and most of the tribal lands. You've come to expect that your water, air and land will be cleaner than in the rest of the nation. You also have the fastest pace of development consuming your landscape. You're the newest region of the U.S., so you're still forming your identity. You attract and favor entrepreneurs, and many of you are either finding new ways to make a living on the land or modifying the traditional ways to remain viable. There might be a mythical streak to it, but you still think of yourselves as living on a frontier.
\
""I've gained an understanding of the West by walking the ground and speaking with people like yourselves. I've watched salmon leaping up the fish ladders on the Columbia River dams. I've been with the crew on a Wyoming natural gas drill rig, on the night shift during a blizzard. I've stood on the front lines of the war against the monstrous wildfires. I've hiked through the ancient pueblos of Chaco Canyon in New Mexico, where a previous Western community once grew, then hit its limits and moved on.
\
""Today's Westerners face a slew of issues, including drought, population growth and immigration. But there is one challenge facing the West above all: energy development. That issue drives pretty much everything. A few basics sum it up: Of all the 50 states, Wyoming is now number one in the production of fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil. New Mexico, Colorado, California, Montana and Utah rank in the top 13. Your power plants burn the fuels to generate the electricity that powers the Western grid. Or you ship your gas or coal by pipeline or train to the Midwest and East, where it heats homes and powers televisions and computers.
\
""The dams on your rivers make your region the leader in hydropower. Washington, California and Oregon are the top three states; Idaho ranks fifth, Montana sixth and Arizona ninth in hydropower.
\
""For more than a century, these resources have been developed here, making your region the Old Energy Frontier.
\
""However, your West also leads the nation in the potential to generate renewable energy from the wind. You're the leader for potential solar energy and in the capacity to generate electricity from geothermal formations. You're even the top region for the potential to harness the energy from ocean waves. And you have significant potential to generate energy from biomass - from forest thinnings, dairy manure and crops.
\
""So you are blessed and you are cursed. You have Old Energy - with all its benefits and drawbacks. And you're poised to lead the nation and the world through a historic transition by blazing a different energy path. This will mean some hardships, but ultimately it will bring progress, new jobs and greater prosperity. If, together, we take the right steps, the West will become the world's New Energy Frontier.
\
""Throughout the 30 years since the last energy crisis, our national leaders and corporations have been partying on fossil fuels. The nation's appetite for energy keeps rising, and now that ravenous appetite is being strangled by a shortage of fuels. Prices are spiking, and many experts believe we're nearing the end of an era - we're not likely to discover enough feasible new supplies. It's way past midnight at the fossil fuel party, folks, and that inspires desperate actions that Westerners feel most of all.
\
""For the last seven years, the current president, with his background in the oil industry, has had his hand on the fossil fuel throttle. He's pushed drilling and mining above all other uses of public lands and resources in the West. True, this has brought paychecks and jobs. But those benefits are short-lived and not sustainable in the long term. Meanwhile, you Westerners have watched your land get torn up, the wildlife chased away, the air and water sullied. Despite attempts to extract fossil fuels responsibly, the results often end up looking like vandalism, violating Western qualities and values.
\
""And in the biggest threat of all, the carbon emissions - from the Old Energy power plants and the leaky wells and pipelines and the vehicles that burn those fuels - cause global warming and climate changes that will challenge generations to come.
\
""The current president has told the West what he wants to do: Extract the remaining fossil fuels to the point of exhaustion, and ramp up uranium mining, and build a big nuclear waste dump to encourage new nuclear power plants. Is that all you want? I don't think so.
\
""As your next president, I'll help you find the way to fulfill your potential as the New Energy Frontier.
\
""This year, the wind, sunlight, geothermal rocks and ocean waves will generate less than 2 percent of the electricity used in the U.S. Federal researchers - some of the world's top experts - say that if we get into gear, we can multiply our New Energy production by 10 times in the next couple of decades. It's even reasonable to generate half the nation's electricity with New Energy by 2030, they say. This electricity can power vehicles, homes and workplaces.
\
""The New Energy industries have greatly improved their technologies since their birth in the last energy crisis. The price of their electricity has plunged; they are more competitive with fossil fuels, and they have far fewer environmental impacts. They still have weaknesses - mainly the intermittency of wind and solar rays - but technologies and strategies are emerging to solve those.
\
""While the federal government has stalled, Westerners, through the recent actions of your governors, legislatures and voters, have moved forward. Many Western states, and the Western Governors' Association, have adopted policies to require utilities to buy more electricity from New Energy projects. Private investment money, much of it from California's software industry, is pouring into New Energy companies in the West.
\
""Companies based in Europe and other places where New Energy is more established are proposing new projects in the West. There's a surge in wind, solar and geothermal projects. Biofuel refineries are popping up amid Colorado farmland, and it won't be long before your coastal waves are generating power. It's an exciting time.
\
""Yet the entrepreneurs struggle to compete with the Old Energy interests, largely because Old Energy has more backing from the federal government. As president, I'll change that. I'll roll back economic policies and infrastructure that favor Old Energy. I'll allow New Energy to compete fairly.
\
As a first priority, I'll lead Congress to adopt a system for realistic pricing of electricity from fossil fuel plants. That means a carbon tax or a 'cap and trade' permitting system to bill companies for at least a fraction of their global warming impacts. That would raise the cost of Old Energy and make the New Energy more attractive in the marketplace.
\
""Then, I'll make the tax policies and subsidies fairer. The federal government currently provides $50 billion to $100 billion each year in tax breaks, other incentives and subsidies for energy development. Sixty-five percent of that goes to fossil fuels and nuclear power gets 12 percent. Wind, solar and geothermal combined get a measly 8 percent. I'll change that math.
\
""Some of the key incentives are federal tax credits for developers of wind, solar and geothermal projects. At various times since they were initiated during the last energy crisis, some of those tax credits have expired or been reduced; some have since been revived or increased. This roller-coaster has created uncertainty - investors and companies often don't know what the tax situation will be in two years, so they can't make solid plans for long-term projects. Those tax credits will expire at the end of this year, unless Congress acts. I'll work with Congress to extend the credits for six to eight years in order to give the entrepreneurs some stability.
\
""As president, I'll also do more to provide federal loan guarantees for New Energy projects, which will encourage conservative bankers to finance new projects. The government already offers guarantees for energy projects; the only taxpayer cost comes if projects fail. That's a diminishing risk these days, with the advances in New Energy technology. But the loan guarantee program now favors nuclear and coal over renewables. We need to do a lot more with loan guarantees for renewables. It's a strategy that's proven effective.
\
""I'll also encourage discoveries - the equivalent of the Lewis and Clark Expedition - by increasing federal investment in energy research. The government is now spending only one-third of what we did each year during the last energy crisis. Researchers say we're on the verge of important breakthroughs in storing wind and solar energy. Engineers have already learned how to store solar energy in molten salts, making power from the sun available up to 18 hours every day. Some say they're close to developing a way to spray photovoltaic films onto panels, which would make solar power a lot cheaper. The West already has research centers in the National Renewable Energy Lab near Denver and the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, and in the entrepreneurial companies now springing up in the region. In the future, the West will export both energy and discoveries made in its labs.
\
""Some of the biggest moves I'll make on the New Energy Frontier have to do with the grid of electricity transmission lines. We need to build new lines into the isolated areas where our wind and solar resources are most concentrated. I'll do more to push agencies such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Energy and the Bureau of Land Management to site transmission lines to facilitate New Energy development.
\
""I'll use two gigantic federal tools in the West - the Bonneville Power Administration, which runs hydropower dams on the Columbia River system, and the Western Area Power Administration, which runs more than 50 dams on the Colorado River system and other rivers. Those federal agencies own big transmission lines - the power backbones of the West. They could build new lines aimed at wind and solar and geothermal areas. That would make it easier to hook up. Costs could be subsidized, or fronted and then recovered from New Energy companies as they hook up.
\
""The more New Energy projects we have connected to the grid across the region, the more reliable New Energy becomes.
\
""I'll also put more effort into figuring out how to use the federal dams - the cheapest constant source of electricity - to 'firm up' the intermittencies of wind and solar power. When wind or solar cuts out temporarily, hydropower could be used as a backup. It wouldn't be easy, because much of that hydropower is already committed to other demands, but researchers are already studying how to do it. A lot of people are pioneering thinkers on the New Energy Frontier.
\
""I'll also push efficiency and conservation. The Department of Energy must continue to toughen the efficiency standards for appliances, for instance. There was almost no progress on that front during the current administration until Congress passed new standards in the 2007 Energy Bill. Still, there's room for progress. More than 50 million homes still have gas-fired hot-water heaters that waste half the energy that goes into them, even though companies are already making far more efficient - and affordable - hot-water heaters.
\
""But as important as conservation is, it's not enough on its own. We need to develop our New Energy resources. We can't just conserve our way out of this crisis.
\
New Energy will have impacts and costs. Expanding the grid will cost more than $1 million per mile. Some public land will be crossed with new lines. Wind projects can take a toll on birds and bats. Solar projects have to cover a noticeable amount of land for each megawatt. Some environmentalists will oppose almost any proposal, and some neighbors will inevitably say 'not in my backyard.'
\
""Critics will argue that the shift toward New Energy will mean higher electricity rates for a while. Some Old Energy jobs will disappear.
\
""But this frontier will also create new jobs and new income streams. A solar power plant or a field of wind turbines can provide just as many jobs for each megawatt as a smoke-spewing power plant. We'll also have new manufacturing jobs for solar and wind equipment - those kinds of manufacturers are taking root in the West as we speak. The equipment prices will drop, and the power will become even more affordable.
\
""Many believe, and I share the belief, that New Energy will be the cheapest energy in the future, even if we don't count the environmental benefits. And because much of the New Energy frontier lies in rural areas, including Indian reservations, where wind and solar potential is high, it will give us a chance to address poverty and stimulate neglected economies.
\
""We won't abandon those who make their living in Old Energy - the coal mines and gas drills will continue running far into the future. But even those companies are already branching out into New Energy, because they're energy companies and they'll take that dedication wherever it may be useful. And who knows, scientists may come up with an effective way to sequester carbon in the West's geologic formations, so Old Energy can be used in a responsible manner.
\
""We can work together on this. Let's help farmers and ranchers stave off subdivisions by helping them do New Energy developments. Let's take action on global warming, and reduce Western wildfires and drought. Let's slow the oil and gas rush. Let's heal the wounds in the federal agencies, by freeing them from the corruption so often found under Old Energy.
\
""Add New Energy projects to the farm bill, for better rural diversification. Add New Energy projects to private land conservation deals. Add New Energy projects to mining law reform, because mined land is already disturbed. Generate power with the methane vented from coal mines rather than just put it into the air.
\
""Together we can preserve the West's values and lead the nation and the world on a better, cleaner path. Join me, Westerners, on the new frontier.

Susan Secord of the Citizens' Climate Lobby mentioned our association's use of Regional Economics Models, Inc., in her July 8 guest editorial in the Daily Camera.
\
No one should be mistaken; the Colorado chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business, America's largest small-business association, definitely does not favor a state carbon tax. Utility companies will pass the cost of this regulation along to consumers and small businesses directly in the form of higher energy prices and indirectly through higher prices for manufactured goods.
\
But let's take a moment to talk about cleaner skies. What is the environmental movement arguing? That we're not cutting carbon emissions at all, or not fast enough? It's never quite clear. So here are some facts everyone should know:
\
- According to the Energy Information Administration, U.S. power plants have already reduced CO2 emissions by 21 percent below 2005 levels.
\
- Secord herself writes ""... according to most accounts, we have already dropped our power plant emissions by 13 percent since 2005 ... So we are well on our way to reaching this goal."" The goal referred to is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 30 percent by 2030.
\
- Here in Colorado, House Bill 1365, which passed a few years back, has required power plants in the state to switch from coal to natural gas.
\
The coal currently being used by power plants, which allow us to boot up our computer and throw on the kitchen light, is mined here and is the cleanest burning in the world.
\
A cleaner environment: Everyone gets it, everyone wants it, and everyone is working toward it. So why introduce economic disruptions like a state carbon tax?
\
As economist William J. Dennis, senior research fellow for NFIB, who has been studying small-business issues for nearly 40 years, puts it, ""Economists generally favor consumption-based taxes as being more efficient than others. For business, the issue is can you pass along the energy cost increases. For consumers, the issue is paying the higher costs for energy (the electricity bill, for example). Editorialists claim the higher consumer price issue can be handled simply by rebating the tax to consumers.
\
""This can be a huge problem, in theory and practice. Do you give the money back to consumers in the same proportion that they use electricity, which begs the question: Why have a carbon tax in the first place? Or, do you redistribute it on a social basis, thereby instituting a new electric bill subsidy program, presumably for the poor. That's not so far-fetched. We already systematically subsidize telephone service. Or does the government just spend the new revenue as it sees fit?""
\
Show of hands for those who believe Dennis' last point is the most likely of all. Thought so.
\
So take a deep breath, Coloradans. Our air is clean and getting cleaner with programs already in place, and with newer technologies that are making energy production more business and environmentally efficient simultaneously.
\
We're getting real-world results from the awareness and desire of everyone for a better environment. We should say ""no"" to a state carbon tax, and ""no"" to its cause-group patrons with no sense of the damage it would bring about.

Boulder voters approved a five-year extension of the city's innovative carbon tax, which levies a tax on energy use and uses the proceeds to pay for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.
\
With 64 percent counted out of an anticipated 173,890 ballots cast countywide, 82 percent of city voters had voted to extend the tax, and 18 percent had voted to allow it to expire in March 2013.
\
First approved by voters in 2006, the Climate Action Plan tax, or carbon tax, generates around $1.9 million for the city.
\
The tax rate varies by usage and sector. The average annual cost to residents is $21. The average annual cost to businesses is $94, and for industrial customers, it's $9,600.
\
City Manager Jane Brautigam said in a news release that the results confirm the community's commitment to the environment.
\
""The Boulder community has once again proven its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change,"" Brautigam said. ""Boulder remains a strong steward of the environment, and I'm proud of our city for being a leader in the region, the state and the nation.""
\
The tax pays for energy-efficiency and renewable-energy programs, including rebates, credits and ""energy audits"" for homeowners and businesses.
\
An analysis of the program's spending found that 41 percent went to services delivery -- a category that includes rebates, incentives and energy audits, as well as consultant services to help the city develop its programs. Another 32 percent went to personnel, and 12 percent went to education and marketing. The rest was spent on overhead and transportation, with an unspent balance of $392,023.
\
City officials said they plan to increase the focus on the commercial sector, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of the city's greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The city is now running a pilot program to get businesses to track their energy use more, and city officials say ""benchmarking"" and reporting likely will become mandatory next year. It's also possible the city will mandate that businesses reach certain energy-efficiency standards.
\
The city now uses CAP money to support the SmartRegs program, which mandates energy-efficiency standards for rental housing.
\
If the CAP tax were not renewed, Boulder would not have money to provide rebates and incentives to help landlords reach those mandates, officials said.
\
Boulder officials also said it would be difficult to continue reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a steady rate if they don't have access to CAP tax funds to encourage upgrades.
\
Boulder is also researching the feasibility of creating a municipal energy utility that would use more renewable energy than Xcel now does. If the city does move forward with municipalization, future energy-efficiency programs could be paid for through utility rates.
\
However, it's not at all certain that the city will form a municipal energy utility, and Boulder officials said they would lose valuable momentum if they cannot continue with programs funded by the CAP tax.

53,"Early on election night, as a drizzly dusk settled over Seattle, I made my way to the Arctic Club, a hotel decorated with explorers' maps and a fake polar bear - a fitting place to await the results on Washington's carbon tax initiative. Upstairs, in a dimly lit ballroom, community organizers and other supporters of the ballot measure had already gathered. Recent polls suggested a close call on the measure, officially called Initiative 1631, a local, political effort to address the global challenge of climate change.\This was the state's second attempt to tax carbon emissions, and in the months leading up to the vote, an unusually wide swath of Washington society had turned out in support. A coalition of environmental groups, labor unions, racial and economic justice advocates, health workers and leaders from nearly two dozen tribal nations had designed the tax proposal, and their supporters, in a mix of work-wear, fleece and the occasional suit, filled the airless room. If people were nervous, it didn't show. A few campaigners sat hunched over computers in the back corner, but mostly, it seemed, people were there to socialize. The line for the bar stretched the length of the room, and a bank of television screens on the far wall drew barely a glance as the evening progressed.\At 8:15 p.m., the buzz of conversation spiked, becoming a roar. ""We did it,"" a young woman standing next to me said. I checked the televisions: A few counties were leaning toward approving the measure. The room began to perk up. Daisy-chains of young supporters, linked arm-in-arm, wound through the crowd, their shirts proclaiming ""Yes on 1631."" ""This energy!"" a man standing nearby exclaimed, surveying the clusters of people shouting enthusiastically about the results. ""People who weren't sure if they were going to win - that's the best.""\The celebrations lasted a few minutes. Then a strange hush swept the room, rippling outward from the televisions. People pulled out their phones to refresh elections pages. A second wave of results had come in, and the tide had turned. By 9 p.m., Initiative 1631 was dead.\A few speakers got up to laud the hard work of campaign staff, and the room, which hadn't quite lost its party feel, echoed with the murmur of people dissecting a loss that hadn't sunk in. Then the speeches ended, and people began to leave, making their way to the city's gloomier bars or pedaling home in the dark. As the room emptied, I stood there refreshing my own phone, wondering what had just happened, and what it might mean.\THE FAILURE OF WASHINGTON'S CARBON TAX proved a dim coda to the state's long fight to control rising temperatures and reverse their effects on its most vulnerable communities. Its demise raised big questions about humanity's ability to address climate change. Yet its failure had seemed improbable. After all, in the months leading up to the vote, climate change made its mark on much of Washington life. Over the summer, a ragged line of wildfires scorched the Northwest, curling from British Columbia through eastern Washington and down to Oregon. Wheat fields and forests burned and towns throughout the region were choked with wildfire smoke. In Seattle, people halted their daily runs and commuters wore masks to work, as an orange murk hid the hills of the suburbs and clung to the Space Needle. In August, a mother orca lost her calf, then carried its body on her nose for 17 days, a painful reminder of species loss and habitat degradation. In the fall, many of the state's largest salmon and steelhead fisheries closed, from the Yakima to the Columbia River, thanks to warming rivers and oceans. Just a few weeks after the election, the National Climate Assessment confirmed that all that was likely just an ominous portent of things to come: Climate change threatens the region's infrastructure with landslides, rising seas and aberrant weather, while its most vulnerable communities face deteriorating air and water quality.\Given these reminders, now would have seemed a prime time for Initiative 1631. For years, economists have said that a carbon tax - which essentially builds an economic incentive to curtail emissions of carbon dioxide - is one of the most efficient ways to combat climate change. Initiative 1631 proposed to do this by putting a fee ($15 per metric ton) on carbon emissions from the largest polluters, then slowly increasing that fee, with the revenue going toward programs that reduce greenhouse gases and pollution and their effects. Washington voters, in other words, were given a specific ac- tion to undertake while they lived out the specific consequences of climate change.\It made sense here, in a green-leaning state where calls to climate action ring louder than in, say, coal-dependent Wyoming. Throughout the Intermountain West, the oil and gas industry provides a lot of jobs and wields a lot of influence, and a significant number of voters support mining and fossil fuel extraction. But in the Northwest, that's not the case. In Washington, hydroelectric dams, not fossil fuels, have long provided the state's energy. In 2017, the state received just over 20 percent of its energy from coal or natural gas, and its only coal power plant is on track to close. That reality has helped green Washington's politics and identity, especially in the western part of the state. Seattle made a commitment in 2002 to eliminate the city's carbon emissions from electricity, one of the first American cities to do so, and voters passed renewable energy standards in 2006. The state put a limit on emissions in 2008. But Initiative 1631 failed, and Washington must now confront a darker version of itself, in the kind of identity crisis that comes only in defeat.\IN THE PAST DECADE, the Northwest has seen a slew of wins in fights against carbon-emitting infrastructure - and a slew of losses on climate policy. KC Golden is a longtime climate campaigner and, until recently, a senior policy advisor at Climate Solutions, which helped craft Initiative 1631. Now almost 60, Golden claimed his first climate victory in the 1980s, when his group Northwest Energy Coalition was part of regional energy efficiency efforts. In those days, Golden was fighting the ""greenhouse effect,"" an early name for the warming effects of carbon dioxide, and he won support by pointing to both reduced energy costs and environmental benefits. By 2008, Golden had helped craft local and state commitments to clean energy, and climate activists stepped back, thinking their local fight was mostly over and the federal government would pick up the slack. President Barack Obama's White House seemed committed, along with much of the world, to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases through regulations and other incentives, with states like Washington, Oregon and California poised to help lead the way.\By 2010, the decline of the U.S. coal market had become obvious, and the fossil fuel industry began to eye the West Coast for access to Asian markets. ""They were holed up in the mountains with their coal, and they were trying to figure out where to go,"" Golden said. The West Coast offered the quickest way from coal country to China, and so began a wave of proposals for trains to haul the coal and for coastal terminals from Oakland, California, to Bellingham, Washington, to export it. The natural gas industry also began to swell, proposing a dozen separate refineries and terminals with their attendant pipelines and trains in Oregon and Washington.\Had every project been built, ""it would certainly make us one of the top fossil fuel transport hubs anywhere in the world,"" said Eric de Place, a programs director at the Sightline Institute, a nonprofit think tank focused on regional sustainability. In addition to concerns about air pollution and the safety of coal trains and gas pipelines, the proposals threatened the region's sense that it was a leader on climate change. ""So much of the region had already invested in its identity as being on the forefront of clean energy,"" Golden said. Climate activists drew what they called a ""thin, green line"" at the coastal Northwestern states, adopting a term coined by de Place to describe their role as a barricade against a fossil fuel boom.\The fight to block fossil fuel infrastructure drew widespread support in Washington and Oregon. The Keep It In The Ground movement, which opposes any new fossil fuel production, firmly established itself with direct action in ""Blockadia,"" as activists strapped themselves to a drill rig headed to the Arctic, blocked trains and demonstrated in the streets of Seattle and Portland. The rural communities of Hoquiam and Aberdeen unanimously banned new crude oil storage facilities in their towns. The Lummi Nation successfully killed a proposal for an export terminal for Montana coal outside Bellingham. In 2018, voters in Kalama, Washington, elected Mayor Mike Reuter, who promised to block construction of a plant for methanol, a fossil fuel with a heavy pollution fingerprint. In Oregon, voters elected a blue bloc of representatives, including Golden's brother Jeff in southern Oregon, who promised to block permits for an LNG export terminal at Jordan Cove.\Why were these so successful, compared to the carbon tax? Since 2013, legislative proposals for either cap-and-trade or carbon taxes have failed three times. A carbon tax failed on the ballot in 2016. In part, the problems with more abstract carbon-pricing proposals, including 1631, were societal and structural. ""(Fossil fuel companies) have spent centuries creating a system of dependency,"" Aiko Schaefer, one of the architects of 1631 and the director of Front and Centered, a climate advocacy coalition for people of color, said. Reimagining it will require a radical overhaul of societal structures, a process she thinks will take longer than an election cycle or two. ""We're trying to break free and make a fundamental shift in our society.""\And the difficulties with that shift run deep in the human psyche. Terminals, refineries and railways exist in the material realm, de Place said. ""If you take a mile-long coal train going through Seattle, it just doesn't look good,"" said de Place. ""We're animals, and we live in a physical world. That physicality did connect up the dots for people.""\PEOPLE ARE ANIMALS, yes, and political animals at that, forming loyal packs and scrapping over neighborhood HOAs, city councils, Congress and the courts. In the months since the vote, national climate politics have remained mired in feuding over partisan responsibility and inaction. But what killed the carbon tax was not a blind, party-line vote: the measure failed in red and blue strongholds alike. Of the 59 percent of Washingtonians who voted to re-elect Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat who supports aggressive climate action, about a quarter rejected the carbon tax. In the end, the measure passed in just three places: Seattle's King County, Port Townsend's Jefferson County and the county that encompasses the San Juan Islands.\The simplest explanation is that people just don't like taxes, and oil and gas outspent green groups to exploit that dislike. In Washington, fossil fuel companies and lobbyists spent more than $30 million to defeat Initiative 1631, versus $17 million from supporters. The solution, then, would seem to be to convince people they'll be just as well off before a carbon tax as after - and to match fossil fuel interests' spending dollar for dollar. But some observers say the challenges with raising taxes to pay for climate action run deeper.\Nives Dolšak and her husband, Aseem Prakash, are both professors, focused on climate change and its human dimensions, at the University of Washington, in Seattle, who spend their days studying climate policy and pushing environmentalists to reflect on their approach. I thought they could tell me what killed the carbon tax, and I spent many rambling hours on the phone with them, discussing the tax's details, and its flaws. Whichever one I'd call, I'd find them together: They have been married for 19 years and often greeted me in unison in a well-worn routine. Still, they argued about the relative importance of this or that point and right up to election night, they were divided on one key point.\""We disagreed on whether 1631 would pass,"" said Dolšak, a seriousseeming woman in her early 50s from Slovenia, speaking with a wry note in her voice. Dolšak thought it was doomed, while Prakash acknowledged ruefully, ""I thought it would pass.""\Not that Dolšak enjoyed being right; 1631's defeat left them both deflated, she said. ""It had all the structural factors in its favor,"" said Dolšak, from the menacing weather that preceded the vote to the overall support for climate action in the state. ""It had no business not passing.""\In the weeks after, as they ate dinner or got ready for work, they'd dissect the results: Is Washington turning conservative? Is any carbon tax doomed to fail? For Dolšak, the less optimistic of the two, the tax's failure reinforced her sense that sweeping climate action is far from imminent. ""When we're thinking of solutions, I'm thinking in two to four years,"" she said. She came to believe it was a failure of Washington's green selfmythology: ""In Washington, we're excited to support environmental action, as long as we don't have to pay for it,"" she said. ""If a carbon tax cannot pass in good economic times, in a pro-environment state like Washington, then action on climate is far more difficult than it used to seem."" Prakash's longer view gave him a more hopeful perspective, she said, forecasting what might happen thousands of years from now.\""That's the Hindu in me!"" Prakash quipped, meaning the tendency to think not just of this reincarnation, but the next and the one after that. Although he believes people will embrace climate action eventually, in the short term, he conceded, ""I think things are going to get worse before they get better.""\Prakash blamed environmentalists and their approach. ""The mainstream environmental groups are less willing to hear from the periphery,"" he said. They focus on consolidating a liberal base, he said, to their detriment. Many groups, including the Sierra Club and The Nature Conservancy, did not back an earlier carbon tax that was designed to appeal to more conservative voters. That, Prakash said, ""was myopic."" (Mo McBroom, director of government relations for The Nature Conservancy's Washington chapter, noted that 1631 differed from 732, as it ""would have provided investments to make our state more resilient to climate change, including reducing risk of forest fire and addressing drought"" and drew support from businesses, prominent philanthropists like Bill Gates, and health professionals.)\In the wake of the election, the couple published half a dozen pieces analyzing the failure that drew on their own discussions. ""Nives and I have not given up on conversation,"" Prakash said. ""It comes out as a family compromise."" What they arrived at was simple: The failure of 1631 was about more than a deep-pocketed oil and gas campaign machine; it spoke to climate action's broader challenges. ""We have anecdotal evidence that money doesn't lead to electoral success,"" Prakash said. And the messaging of the ""No"" on 1631 campaign fed on the rich vein of discontent around accountability for the funds the tax would raise, as well as the worry that voters, rather than large-scale polluters, would end up paying for the cost of climate change.\STILL, IT WASN'T ADVERTISING campaigns or partisanship alone that killed the tax: it got mired in the same murk that has slowed climate action for decades. The climate is too big for us to easily wrap our minds around, and so it proves to be a difficult issue to legislate. This election cycle, Jordan Stevenson was a fellow at the advocacy group Our Climate, which supported Washington's carbon tax. A 20-year-old woman with square glasses and a knack for getting people to talk, she spent weeks knocking on doors in the Spokane area, on the far eastern side of the state, along with her husband. She also talked to her father, back home in Vancouver. ""He said, 'I'm glad you're working on this,' "" she told me. "" 'I'll take a look.' "" But in the end, she's not sure he even voted. When she spoke to voters in Spokane, not many people there knew what the tax was, let alone what it had to do with the wildfire smoke outside their windows. ""It still didn't seem concrete or tangible to people,"" Stevenson said. Voters told her: ""The money I pay in taxes, the increase at the gas pump, it will never benefit me.""\Initiative 1631's demise might have had something to do with moments like this, where the connection between taxing carbon and more immediate fears about one's health or one's job becomes obscured. The initiative promised to pool funds for projects, including new bus lines, land conservation grants, and training to transition fossil fuel workers into other jobs. But when people need to choose between their day-to-day concerns and a future pot of money for projects they can't imagine, the day-to-day wins. Our minds are better suited to immediate threats - like snarling hyenas or flammable trains - and we struggle with the abstract dangers of a changing climate.\""People don't get worried about problems that aren't happening today or tomorrow,"" Dolšak said. Those climate hawks who believe that extreme weather events, like wildfires and hurricanes, will inspire climate inactivists are overly optimistic, Prakash said. ""An extreme weather event doesn't affect political leanings."" Ongoing, intensifying hurricanes in Florida, for example, have not necessarily driven people to vote for liberal candidates who back climate action, and extreme weather has a relatively small impact on public opinion.\""A lot of environmentalists are approaching conservation and pollution reduction from a normative perspective: We have to reduce pollution and protect the environment,"" Dolšak told me. Instead, the question is over the cost required to take action: ""How much is society willing to pay to reduce this problem versus another, equally important problem?""\Despite the work of scientists and researchers, whose models are getting better at explaining the chaotic relationships between climate and weather, the truth is that the destructiveness of a particular storm is hard to link straight to a changing climate - what experts call ""the attribution problem."" Smoky summer days in Idaho can seem far removed from a tax, or fee, that will somehow reduce carbon emissions, somehow slow climate change, and somehow decrease wildfires. In this way, climate change can boggle the imagination. Unsurprisingly, the carbon tax found wide support among the state's tribal nations, some of whom face the obvious possibility of displacement due to rising seas, and in Seattle's communities of color, where air pollution already causes higher-than-average rates of asthma.\In short, the difficulty of addressing climate stems from its very power: Its effects are inextricable from the way we have configured our society. If we have to name 1631's killer, it might be what geographer Mike Hulme called the ""climate of climate change."" Hulme, an expert in climate change theory at the University of Cambridge, argues that our concept of climate is only partly rooted in objective truths about the material world. At least as powerful is the fact that climate fundamentally formed human cultures, contributing to our idea of it as static. It is impossible to separate ourselves from the climate far enough to get a clear look at it, something equally true of many injustices and economic structures. All of these things are wrapped together, but the climate is changing, and so must our analysis of it.\""All aspects of human life are now analyzed or represented in relation to climate: gender, violence, literature, security, architecture, the imagination, football, tourism, spirituality, ethics, and so on,"" Hulme wrote. ""All human practices and disputes can now be expressed through the language of climate change, which has become a new medium through which human life is lived.""\Given this, the fight over what to do about rising temperatures epitomizes all our other disagreements over what justice - let alone climate justice - might, and should, look like. For example, Stevenson, the canvasser, was first drawn to climate activism through her interest in reproductive health and justice: ""There are areas where people's children are not growing up healthy because they're breathing in fumes or drinking fossil fuels in their water,"" she said. She used that argument to talk to her dad about climate change, invoking his sense of familial values and his worry for his kids and grandkids. The fight for the carbon tax, then, becomes a fight for what the future of our society ought to look like - and on that, we remain deeply conflicted.\SOME SAY THE DEATH OF THE CARBON TAX was easily foreseen. ""The word 'tax' is probably the most reviled word,"" said Hal Harvey, CEO of the firm Energy Innovation, which helps design renewable energy policies around the globe. ""The first lesson is: Don't lead with your chin."" Harvey, an energy wonk with a cheery, blunt manner, said the state's climate coalition should have pushed for more immediately achievable ends first, such as fuel efficiency standards modeled on California's, or tighter building regulations. ""If you had to choose between performance standards and a carbon tax, you'd be insane to pick a carbon tax,"" said Harvey.\Dolšak tends to agree: She hypothesized that even cap-and-trade, which often amounts to the same thing as a carbon tax, might have passed in the state, given that it sidesteps the word tax and directly limits emissions. A quirk of state law classified 1631 as a fee, evoking a parking ticket for emitting, rather than a cost to everyday consumers, but most voters identified it as a tax.\Economists generally support a carbon tax over regulations or building standards, because it costs all emitters fairly, in proportion to their emissions. A building standard, for example, might require different windows, different insulation, a different design ... and by the time you're done, it's hard to disentangle what you did from what you might have done otherwise, and even harder to say how much more money per ton of carbon was effective. In practice, however, many key emitters are relatively unaffected by a carbon tax. Those who build new buildings are rarely the ones paying the energy bills, so a tax on emissions is more likely to hit the building's occupants.\On the other hand, voters - most of whom aren't economists - tend to prefer energy standards because they put the costs on those most directly responsible for carbon-emitting systems, the real estate developers and car designers. And although the cost of new standards varies between industries, within them, the costs are the same. An engineer at Volvo isn't likely to compare her efficiency costs to those of double-paned windows in a new high-rise. Rather, she'll look to her competitor at Peugeot, who is under the same constraints.\Washington may already be learning its lesson. Less than a month after the carbon tax failed, Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat who backed it and has suggested that he might run for president on a climate change platform, held a press conference to announce a new green legislative deal. ""This is the greatest endeavor of our time,"" he told a crowd of reporters at a workspace for energy efficiency innovators in Seattle. ""It is a moment of great peril but it is also a moment of great promise."" He unveiled a plan he hopes to put before the state Legislature this year, one that encompasses clean fuel standards, tighter building codes and a shift to 100 percent clean energy.\The time for a carbon tax will come, Harvey said. The warming climate will produce - in fact, it is already producing - challenges that altered consumption habits and more efficient buildings can't pay for. The costs of relocating communities farther inland from the coasts, for example, won't be recouped from sales of Teslas. But for now climate activists are stuck with the art of the possible. ""The essence of strategy is making choices,"" Harvey said. "" 'Everything' is not a choice.""\IN THE WEEKS AFTER THE DEATH of 1631, climate activists took little time to grieve, refusing to declare defeat. This wasn't the end, they swore; it was just the beginning. ""2019 is a year we can make a lot of progress on this,"" Nick Abraham, a spokesman for the Yes on 1631 campaign, told me. ""We've moved the conversation away from, 'Should we take action?' to, 'What should action look like?' ""\""I want to make sure people don't take the vote count and say, 'Pffft,' and move on,"" Schaefer, the head of Front and Centered and one of 1631's designers, said. ""When my kid plays soccer, when he loses a game, I don't say, 'Don't play soccer anymore.' ""\But if climate hawks want to make progress, they'll need to grapple with the cause of death for Initiative 1631. Not long ago, I met Golden in a noisy coffee shop a little over a mile away from the site of the election night failure, for a final postmortem. He was in a reflective mood: Climate Solutions was in the midst of moving offices, and they'd unearthed years of news clippings on the long fight for climate action in the state, records of campaigns and failures going back more than a decade. Golden's mind was on what would come next, including setting aside the fight for a carbon tax, for now. ""Carbon pricing is not our quest,"" he said, his voice both uptempo and steady. Carbon taxes are just a tool. ""Our quest is to deal with climate change.""\Without a course correction, climate activists may well find themselves right back where they started, raising the body count on failed climate initiatives while blithely marching forward. In Canada, for example, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced blowback for his carbon tax proposal. And not long after the U.S. midterms, France underwent a major political crisis, brought in part by a fuel tax meant to curb emissions. In the U.S., advocates are crafting an economic stimulus package - a Green New Deal. And there, at least, they seem to have taken the hint: That package sidesteps a carbon tax entirely.\Over a cup of tea, Golden dissected, and then dissected again, the faults of the tax and the future of climate action. ""The fundamentals are there,"" he concluded. But the moral urgency, the sense that life after oil is a real possibility, the feeling that anything useful can be done - those aren't. In Washington, even as winter faltered and delivered a meager snowpack, concerns over climate change had been quickly replaced by more immediate worries: a federal shutdown and a volatile stock exchange. So even if a majority of Americans believe in climate change, that statistic amounts to very little. It's just another thing to worry about, on a heaping plate of worry.\What, then, should we take away from the death of 1631? The big lesson is that we need to seek the root cause of our worries, clarify our fears and to face them head on. Golden thinks the first step is to regain a sense that our collective actions can actually affect the course of climate change. On our dependence on fossil fuels, ""we're fighting something that's dying,"" Golden told me. ""We're just not on the same timeline as physics."" Climate change is not just an environmental problem or an economic problem, and it can't be framed that way. It's a challenge to our moral imagination - and a big one. Putting a policy to that will be as daunting as it is urgent.\We finished our drinks and parted ways. Outside, the winter weather was particularly nasty, with rain that flew sideways and high winds shoving people around the sidewalks. I made my way through the streets, my thoughts scattered, and before I could really think through all I'd just learned, a gust of wind caught me by surprise and nearly slammed me into a building. I stumbled down a flight of stairs looking for somewhere to retreat to, but there was nothing around but bad weather."

Last week, hundreds of us streamed into two large conference rooms in the Denver EPA headquarters to speak for five minutes each on the proposed Clean Power Plant Rules. Three EPA officials sat in each room and attentively listened to people who had come from all over the western United States to weigh in on the Obama administration's attempt to rein in emissions from existing power plants, the biggest single source of CO2 emissions in the country. There were well thought-out, impassioned speeches from many points of view. Coal miners, utility employees and railroad workers were concerned about the viability of their own jobs and profits while health care providers, environmentalists, and a range of citizens were equally concerned about the impacts of emissions on public health, the environment and the viability of life on Earth for themselves and future generations.
\
In response to President Obama's directive, the EPA's Clean Power Plant Rules establish regulations with the goal of reducing emissions from existing power plants to 30 percent below 2005 emissions by the year 2030. Since the Supreme Court has ruled that the Clean Air Act not only gives the EPA the right to control carbon emissions but it also requires the EPA to do so, these regulations are long overdue.
\
It should be noted that emissions from power plants represent about one third of the CO2 emissions in our country. The proposed regulations do not address transportation, residential, commercial, agricultural, or industrial emissions. So these standards should be seen as a minimal good start. Also, according to most accounts, we have already dropped our power plant emissions by 13 percent since 2005, and we have about 15 years to drop by another 17 percent. So we are well on our way to reaching this goal.
\
The EPA proposes to give states choice in how to meet the standards, and states can reduce emissions at the power plants or through offsets that are outside the fence of the power plant but within the state.
\
Among economists, a carbon tax is widely accepted as the most economically efficient and cost-effective way to reduce CO2 emissions. Though directed at reducing CO2 emissions, carbon taxes can also help states reduce other fossil fuel byproducts, including particulates and mercury.
\
Detractors who argue against a carbon tax say it will kill jobs, drag down the economy and burden families with higher energy bills. But a well-designed carbon tax that recycles revenue back to households and into the economy would protect families from rising costs and actually add jobs. A recent study by Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI) found that a carbon tax in California would increase GDP and add hundreds of thousands of jobs while significantly reducing CO2 emissions, provided the revenue is returned to the public, either as tax cuts or direct payments. Other states could achieve similar benefits. REMI also just released a 20-year analysis of the impacts of a gradually increasing national revenue-neutral carbon tax. That study showed that under such a plan the United States would reduce CO2 emissions to 50 percent of 1990 levels while simultaneously adding $1.375 trillion to the GDP and adding 2.8 million jobs. Real income would increase and premature deaths would decrease by 227,000.
\
It should be noted that Regional Economic Models, Inc. is a highly regarded non-partisan consulting organization that has been in business for 30 years. Their clients include 47 state governments, cities, towns, Fortune 500 companies and organizations such as the American Gas Association, the Nuclear Energy Institute, and the National Federation of Independent Business. REMI approached the study from a purely economic point of view; they had no pre-conceived agenda for how the study would turn out.
\
The experience of British Columbia, Canada gives a real life example of how a gradually increasing revenue-neutral carbon tax can work at a sub-national level. Since passing the tax in 2008, British Columbia has significantly reduced its CO2 emissions while strengthening its economy.
\
The evidence from the REMI studies and from British Columbia's experience shows that we don't need to choose between reducing greenhouse gases and a strong economy. We can have both. The EPA should allow for a state carbon tax as one option for states to reach their goals. If the carbon tax is revenue-neutral, Colorado and other states will surpass their CO2 emission reduction goals while adding jobs and strengthening their economies.

55,"Label: GUEST COMMENTARY\ After running on a platform to get the economy moving again, the Clinton administration came out of the gates with a social agenda (abortion and gay rights) and an agenda for new taxes. Unfortunately, these are not elements of an economic policy that will create jobs, promote economic growth and increase American competitiveness.\ But the tilt light blinked brightest at the prospects of an energy tax, floated during the first week of the Clinton presidency by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and other members of the economic team.\ Energy taxes take many forms: a tax on sales of energy fuels such as coal, oil, natural gas and hydroelectricity (an ad valorem tax); a tax on the amount of energy produced by different fuels (a BTU tax); a carbon tax (a favorite of environmentalists to reduce greenhouse gas emissions); an oil import fee (to cut oil imports); and a gasoline tax (to promote conservation). Of these, a carbon tax is a particularly bad idea, both from an economic and an environmental point of view.\ Carbon taxes would increase the price of coal at least twice as much as other energy fuels. Carbon tax proponent John Peterson of the Government Finance Group estimates that a carbon tax would increase the price of gasoline, natural gas and fuel oil by 10 to 20 percent and of coal by 60 percent.\ A recent study by Boulder-based Resource Data International shows a carbon tax would have other results. First, a carbon tax would require electric utilities to reduce coal burning, substituting fuels with lower taxes, such as oil and natural gas.\ Second, hundreds of billions of dollars invested in coal chain industries - coal mines, coal transportation and coal-fired power plants - and paid for by rate payers since the first oil price shock in 1973, would have to be written off. That would be like asking a family to tear down their home (while remaining responsible for the mortgage payments) and build another, taking on a new mortgage.\ Third, the increased cost of energy would ripple through the entire economy, decreasing international competitiveness for everyone, but especially for manufacturing and other energy intensive industries located in the industrial belt. Yet these are the industries that produce the ""good jobs at good wages"" that Bill Clinton says he wants to save.\ Result: A carbon tax would slow economic growth, cost jobs and reduce the competitiveness of American business.\ There is also an environmental problem. Most of the rest of the world burns coal, and more than 80 percent of the increase in greenhouse gases over the next 100 years will come from the developing nations, not the U.S. or the industrialized world.\ The U.S. leads the world in the development of coal conversion technology that permits cleaner and more efficient coal combustion. If a carbon tax forces utilities to back coal out of the U.S. fuel mix, both public and private investment in coal combustion technologies will dry up. People do not invest in declining industries.\ Though nature determines carbon emissions from burning a ton of coal, new technology can improve coal-burning efficiency - for example, from the 10 to 20 percent found in China and other developing countries to the 30 to 40 percent found in the U.S. Result: with greater combustion efficiency, less coal is needed to produce the same amount of electricity, which means greenhouse gas emissions are reduced significantly on a global basis.\ So, like so many things in life, the enlightened policy is counter-intuitive. If you really want to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, do not discourage the use of coal in the U.S. It's the global environment, stupid.\ Burgess is president of the Center for the New West, a think tank in Denver specializing in economics and social change."
56,"\It's no longer free to pollute carbon in Canada Simple economics can influence human behavior. Humans listen to the economic sermon of the mighty dollar more than we listen to the moral sermons of right and wrong. We know it is morally wrong to pollute the atmosphere, as Pope Francis reminds us, yet we persist. Americans need encouragement to take action on climate change, and we can follow the lead of our neighboring Canada, by using economics. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is on board with international commitments to reduce emissions, mitigating a warming and disruptive climate. It's no longer free to pollute carbon in Canada. As of the first of April, all provinces are required to have some form of carbon pricing, which in turn will influence their choices for years to come.\Hats off to Canada for leading at this crucial time in history. Canadian Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna stated: ""We are all paying the cost of storms, floods, wildfires and extreme heat. Our government is ensuring a price across Canada on what we don't want, pollution, so we can get what we do want — lower emissions, cleaner air, opportunities for businesses with clean solutions and more money in the pockets of Canadians.""\In the U.S., the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 763) is gaining traction in the House of Representatives with 27 cosponsors. Similar to Canada, it would drive down America's carbon pollution and bring climate change under control while unleashing America's can-do talent in technology and innovation.\Susan Atkinson, Durango Mark Kennedy is unfit to serve as CU president I write to you as a 1996 University of Colorado alum and to strongly oppose the candidacy of Mark Kennedy as university president.\As you know, Kennedy represented Minnesota in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a representative, he voted yes on constitutionally defining marriage as one man and one woman (July 2006); voted yes on a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage (September 2004); voted no on $84 million in grants for Black and Hispanic colleges (March 2006); voted yes on deauthorizing ""critical habitat"" for endangered species (September 2005); voted yes on speeding up approval of forest-thinning projects (November 2003); voted yes on prohibiting product misuse lawsuits on gun manufacturers (October 2005); voted yes on prohibiting suing gunmakers and sellers for gun misuse (April 2003); voted yes on limiting medical malpractice lawsuits to $250,000 damages (May 2004); voted yes on limited prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients (November 2003); and the list goes on. Was this voting record discussed during his interview? If so, will his comments be made public?\Diversity of background and thought is right for higher education. At Colorado, at CU Boulder — everywhere. This is not that. This is a man who has stood with the gun lobby (A+ NRA rating), has opposed LGBT and civil rights at every turn, and is anti-public health and education.\As an LGBT community alum, I am particularly disgusted by his anti-LGBT voting record and current views. He has not ""evolved"" on fundamental issues of civil rights.\""The societal consensus on marriage equality has changed since that vote in the early 2000s,"" Kennedy said Wednesday. ""I consider same-sex marriage a settled issue. Today, marriage equality is the law. I support the law, and my track record affirms this support.\""During my time here at UND, we have appointed our first LGBTQ dean. One of my program directors at George Washington is gay.

I am an active alum and a donor, and I am on the national board of advisors for the University of Colorado Alumni Association. I fiercely oppose this candidate.\Chris Allieri, Brooklyn, N.Y."
57,"\The Colorado Daily's recent report on the CU-led research on the oft-overlooked effects of the noise pollution associated with fossil fuel extraction raised my awareness of a problem that I was not even conscious of: Birds are developing PTSD-like symptoms from the drilling noises.\Indeed, in a twist of irony, I had always assumed that renewables — specifically wind power — carried the greatest risk to birds. But some further research reveals that it has long been known that this is not the case. A study from 2009, ""Contextualizing avian mortality: A preliminary appraisal of bird and bat fatalities from wind, fossil-fuel, and nuclear electricity,"" found that wind farms in the U.S. killed about 7,000 birds in 2006, compared to 327,000 bird deaths from nuclear power plants and a whopping 14.5 million from fossil fuels. And this is to say nothing of the damage to birds' livelihoods highlighted in the study the Daily reported on.\All of this is to say, I now have yet another reason to be desirous of a societal switch away from fossil fuels. Unfortunately, the problem is not a dearth of reasons on the part of myself and my fellow graduate student population. Rather, the (or, at least, a) problem is a lack of solutions that appeal to the majority of Americans, many of whom fear the big, clumsy hand of government more than they fear a few million bird deaths.\What solution can be struck to appease everyone while also not backing down from a commitment to help the environment, both for its own sake and for ours? The answer may well be a carbon tax. Imposed nationwide, it would place a cost on the extraction of greenhouse gas-emitting substances in proportion to how much is emitted.\A carbon tax is not a solution that traffics in absolutes. It will not shut down all, or even many, coal-fired power plants overnight. But that is the point. Most carbon tax proposals are designed to increase over time in a preannounced way so major economic players can plan accordingly. In this fashion, the tax promotes, via the market, a maximally smooth and gradual transition away from carbon.\One nonpartisan organization that already has a foothold in Boulder and is interested in promoting this approach is the Citizens' Climate Lobby . And just now, an additional chapter of CCL is forming at CU Boulder. If you are a student and you are interested, why not join us? It's an engaging, practical way of flipping climate change the bird.\By Daniel Palken, research assistant at CU, Boulder"

We go through life oscillating between needing a hand and being able to lend one. The key is finding something you're passionate about and getting involved.\I'm passionate about making the world a better place for future generations. I believe I can do that best by working with kids with limited opportunities. Fortunately, I've found an organization that does just that — ""I Have A Dream"" Foundation of Boulder County.\""I Have A Dream"" provides academic, cultural, and mentoring assistance to reduce high school dropout rates of underprivileged kids. ""I Have A Dream"" is unique because their assistance isn't for a few weeks, months, or a year; the program provides aid throughout a youth's schooling. In some cases, that's an 11-year commitment. This long-term approach is a big part of why I wanted to get involved.\I started volunteering with ""I Have A Dream"" this year and am continually impressed with the difference they're making. I, along with a group of elite-level runners, visit the fourth-grade cohort at Thunder Valley K-8 to support their programming and share our love of running with the kids. Most volunteer opportunities start with the desire to help and end up with both parties being better for it. One of my favorite things is the ""circle"" at the end of our sessions. The kids have an opportunity to respectfully address disagreements, express thanks, or send someone well wishes. Their genuine responses have really stuck with me.

Public support for LGBTQ community building, but more is needed I am writing in response to the April 7 article ""Asexual people in Boulder County fight against notion of what makes a person whole.""\Individuals who identify as asexual in the Boulder community feel as though others are misled to believe their lack of sexual attraction is a problem that needs to be fixed in order to be happy. This misconception leads others who do experience sexual attraction to believe asexually is a problem. What if someone came to you trying to ""fix"" you simply because you have purple hair? There is nothing wrong with purple hair and there is nothing wrong with identifying as asexual. Discrimination and stigma can have extremely detrimental effects on one's mental health. Alienation causes people to rethink their own identification and feel as though there might actually be something wrong with them.\Worldwide rates of depression and generalized anxiety disorder continue to rise. Within the past two decades, public support for the LGBTQ community has increased immensely, however, mental health conditions continue to be a major problem within the community. Many people feel as though they are viewed as an outcast and isolated. As a community, we must work toward common support. Schools, communities and parents can make a difference toward building an accepting and welcoming environment to provide a safe place for everyone in the LBGTQ community.\By Carson Shea, Newport Beach, Calif. Fighting climate change demands political action I am writing in your response to the April 30 article on the recent trend towards eco-friendly homes. I always find myself conflicted on how to feel about such news. On the one hand, a world in which people look to make environmentally informed decisions on their major purchases is better than an all-else-equal world where they do not. But in the back of my head, I worry that those very decisions allow residents of places like Boulder to feel a little too complacent about having made their contribution to a greener world.\The carbon footprint of a typical American, even one living in a house built partially for ecological sustainability, still far outweighs that of an average person, globally speaking. If we have to wait for worldwide economic solutions that bring everyone to the wealth level of the typical Boulderite, where they feel fiscally able to devote some of their resources to reducing their emissions, then by the time we reach that point, it will be too late.\However, merely knowing how to act against climate change is nontrivial, and often the most readily available solutions are the ones that involve cutting emissions in our own lives. There is no reason we should not seize upon them when we can. My argument is merely that this should be part of a broader plan of action for each of us.\Personally, I try to make an effort to speak out politically in favor of a carbon tax. A carbon tax would add a cost to greenhouse gas-emitting sources of fuel in a minimally governmentally intrusive way. Products and services throughout the economy that produce more emissions in getting to market would see their prices raised commensurately. This in turn would incentivize environmentally responsible purchases, and markets would get to work at making ever-greener products and technologies. The money raised from the tax could be returned to citizens as a dividend on a per capita basis as in the policy proposal put forth by the Citizens Climate Lobby .\This carbon fee and dividend solution strikes me as practical because its reliance on markets, rather than government intrusion, has an appeal to conservatives whom I've spoken to about it. But at the same time, it gets all of society on the same page in aligning our purchases with the good of our planet.\By Dan Palken, graduate student at CU, Boulder"
59,"Label: CLINTON AND THE WEST\ Although Bill Clinton's presidential victory was called a sweeping mandate for change, no one is sure his administration will substantially alter life in the West.\ Sure, some modest predictions about the environment come easily: Wolves may be reintroduced to Yellowstone. National parks may have more money for maintenance.\ But a wider array of economic questions with more direct bearing on Westerners still await answers: How will Clinton resolve the spotted owl controversy in the Northwest, and how many logging jobs will be affected? Will government continue to dole out subsidies that artificially bolster economic growth in logging and ranching?\ Under 12 years of Republican rule, the West saw the rise and fall of the Sagebrush Rebellion, aimed at privatizing public lands. The Reagan and Bush administrations diminished environmental barriers to oil and gas exploration and slowed additions to the endangered species list.\ That prompted a rising tide of environmentalism, highlighted by the 20th anniversary of Earth Day in 1990. Environmentalists' successes in such areas as wetlands and endangered species protection in turn triggered another reaction in the form of the industry-backed ""Wise Use Movement.""\ Now comes the Clinton administration, with Vice President Al Gore, the former Tennessee senator with a reputation as a conservationist, and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, a confirmed environmentalist.\ At stake are the future use and protection of 662 million acres of public lands in the West, including about 22 million acres in Colorado. At stake too are jobs, industries and ways of life. Many of those decisions will be made by presidential appointees, not Congress.\ Industry analysts and environmentalists say Clinton's early appointments send a mixed message. Most see no clear indication that life will suddenly be more difficult for, say, logging companies. Or that river outfitters can expect a sudden moratorium on dam-building.\ Environmentalists are pleased with the selection of Babbitt, the former Arizona governor who more recently directed the League of Conservation Voters, a nonpartisan group that highlights environmental voting records. They also like Gore's long-standing concern for worldwide environmental issues such as global warming.\ Yet Clinton's campaign theme was ""putting people first."" His initial Cabinet appointments were intended to signal that the economy was his top priority. After all, a widely publicized sign posted on the wall of his campaign headquarters read: ""It's the economy, dummy.""\ So, while environmentalists cheered Cabinet selections, some in industry sighed with relief to see liberal Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth passed over for energy secretary in favor of Hazel O'Leary, a power company executive. Others took heart with Clinton's selection of the president of a natural gas company for his White House chief of staff.\ Loggers, miners and stockmen are wary of Gore and Babbitt, but they're far from pushing the panic button. ""At this point, we are going to take him (Clinton) at his word"" about putting people first, said Barbara Grinnell of the Western States Public Lands Coalition, an industry-backed group with 350,000 members. ""I'm optimistic, but I'm not taking anything to the bank.""\ ENERGY:\ West hopes for natural gas boost\ During the campaign, Clinton and Gore spoke of encouraging use of alternative energy, especially compressed natural gas to power vehicles.\ A first step would be to convert more government vehicles to the fuel. Larger markets for natural gas would have a big impact on jobs in the West, where there are vast supplies of the fuel.\ ""Everything sounds positive,"" said Jon Whitney, president of the Colorado Interstate Gas Co. ""He's (Clinton) saying natural gas is the environmentally preferred fuel.""\ Longtime Clinton friend Thomas ""Mack"" McLarty, a chief executive officer for a natural gas company, will be White House chief of staff, and that can't hurt, Whitney acknowledged.\ Jess Cooper, vice president of the Denver-based Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas Association, conceded natural gas will ""have a much higher profile. But no matter what they do, oil is still very, very important. There's always the line that natural gas is better environmentally than oil, but you've got to drill to get it. You've still got to go out and do the same things to get it.""\ Still, it can't be ignored that Clinton has promised to continue the prohibition on drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, believed to be one of the nation's largest untapped supplies.\ The depth of the Clinton/Gore commitment to tougher clean air laws also could affect the West's economy. Gore's support for solving global environmental problems could lead to anti-coal provisions in international treaties. If the Clinton administration moves toward a so-called ""carbon tax"" by measuring carbon dioxide emissions, hings could go sour quickly for Western coal producers.\ Coal burning emits more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than the burning of other fuels such as heating oil or natural gas. Carbon dioxide is one of the leading causes of ozone depletion.\ A severe carbon tax could cause layoffs of coal miners in Colorado and could raise electric rates for residents of Colorado Springs, who get their power from two coal-fired power plants.\ AGRICULTURE:\ Ranchers wary of new grazing fees\ Nate Patton has been ranching for 50 years. He took a seat on the Bureau of Land Management's Grazing Advisory Board ""to protect my own backside.""\ Like thousands of ranchers in the West, Patton depends on being able to graze his cattle on federal property for a fee. Environmentalists have criticized the practice, saying ranchers have paid only one-fourth of the market rate for grazing rights and have been allowed to overgraze the land in some cases.\ Under Republican rule, the BLM lacked money to enforce permit provisions restricting the number of cows that could graze a given piece of property. There were few disagreements over range management.\ But, long before Clinton arrived, Patton began to see changes in the way his industry relates to the federal government. Attempts to raise grazing fees on federal lands have become an annual event, and he worries about ""extreme environmentalism and the protection of thousands of endangered species.""\ With Babbitt overseeing the BLM's 164 million acres of grazing lands, cattlemen fear their way of life is in jeopardy. It's not that Clinton targeted grazing fees in his campaign - just that ranchers don't think he will protect their interests as former Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan did.\ ""We're real apprehensive, but the jury's still out"" Patton said of a grazing policy change under Clinton.\ Legislation to raise grazing fees has been approved by the House in each of the past two years, but has been rejected by the Senate. Many ranchers, including Patton, fear that congressional support for the current grazing system is eroding.\ Babbitt's appointment of a BLM director will provide a strong hint about the administration's intentions.\ Clinton's agriculture secretary, Mike Espy, is a farmer with a record of fighting against grazing fee hikes during his tenure as a congressman. His appointment drew applause from the American Farm Bureau Federation. And, as a governor, Clinton was ""receptive to the Farm Bureau and stood up against excessive regulations,"" said Andy Colosimo, spokesman for the Colorado Farm Bureau.\ WATER POLICY:\ Water projects likely to lose out\ President Jimmy Carter got all the credit - or blame, depending on one's point of view - for eliminating federal funding for Western water projects. But few of the projects on Carter's famed ""hit list"" were restored by Reagan and Bush.\ And that's just fine with Bill Dvorak, who owns a river-rafting business north of Salida.\ Dvorak expects Bruce Babbitt to further shrink - or eliminate - the Bureau of Reclamation, builder of many large Western water projects. With no sizable projects to build, the agency already has been reduced to a caretaker for existing dams like the Pueblo Reservoir.\ The last big piece of work on the agency's agenda in Colorado is the $640 million Animas-\ La Plata water project, intended to satisfy legitimate American Indian water claims without destroying the farm economy in the state's southwestern corner. That project would require huge subsidies from both the state and federal treasuries, a prospect that, combined with the agency's reduced clout, could spell doom for Animas-La Plata. If the project is killed, Ute Indians could go to court and win back water taken from them decades ago.\ The federal government can control new water projects through the power of the purse, but Dvorak and others think environmental protection of waterways could come in another form, under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.\ Dale Pontius, a spokesman for American Rivers, a leading river protection organization, said numerous river segments can qualify for designation under the law, which seeks to protect rivers from more dams.\ ""There's a great opportunity to add a significant number of rivers that are ready to be debated and put in the (National Wild and Scenic River) system. . . . A hands-on secretary will put somebody on it. Bruce Babbitt could do that, and I think he'll put a lot of attention to it.""\ Perhaps. But the government has been protecting stream segments for 25 years now. While there are more than 10,000 river miles federally protected in the nation, Colorado water providers have managed to limit the state's Wild and Scenic inventory to a single, 75-mile segment of the Poudre River in northern Colorado.\ NATIONAL PARKS:\ Babbitt called perfect advocate\ What many environmentalists refer to as the nation's crown jewels - its national parks - also fall under Babbitt's control. He's ""the perfect choice,"" said Nick Clark, a spokesman for the National Parks and Conservation Association.\ Babbitt spearheaded a move to use $20 million in Arizona lottery revenues to maintain the state's park system. Clark says that's a sure sign Babbitt will pursue more money for infrastructure maintenance within the parks. ""The National Park Service is a $2 billion agency that's being given $1 billion to operate,"" Clark said.\ In Colorado, budget cuts have forced a hiring freeze and other cutbacks at Rocky Mountain National Park, which hosted three million visitors last year.\ ENDANGERED SPECIES:\ Clinton's conflicting aims tested\ Re-authorization of the Endangered Species Act figures to be the leading environmental bellwether for the Clinton administration. Perry Pendley, of the conservative Mountain States Legal Foundation, predicted the president ""will go whole hog"" in the effort to keep a strong law, placing species protection ahead of economic factors.\ If so, numerous jobs could be either lost or not created.\ An important test case will be how Babbitt, with Clinton watching closely, handles the controversy over whether to cut old-growth timber in the Northwest in the face of evidence that the cutting threatens extinction of the spotted owl. But other species, and their corresponding interest groups, are waiting in the wings.\ Renee Askins, executive director of the Wolf Fund, is one advocate who thinks the Clinton administration will make a huge difference. ""It feels to me like there's been a sea change,"" she said. ""What we have here is a basic philosophical shift away from the human-centered, exploit-all-resources, exterminate-anything-that's-an-inconvenience, toward a movement based on preserving the integrity of ecosystems.""\ Askins predicted that wolves will be reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park sometime in the next four years.\ LOGGING:\ Loss of subsidies would hurt state\ Like most agriculture secretaries, Mike Espy has little background in timbering. Thus industry spokesmen and environmentalists have made only guarded statements about the immediate future of the Forest Service, which will be guided largely by a yet-to-be-named assistant agriculture secretary.\ However, ""Espy understands commodity production, and he's from the South, where timber management is an important business,"" said Kevin Cain, a spokesman for the Stone Container Co., a multinational wood products corporation with a mill in South Fork.\ Further, the president needs the wood products industry as part of his plans for an economic rebound, Cain said.\ ""In every case when this country went into a recession, housing starts led the way out,"" he said.\ But Cain must balance that qualified optimism against the reality of the past few years.\ His company has been targeted several times by those protesting timber cuts in old-growth forests, which are deemed critical wildlife habitat by environmentalists.\ It has been difficult for Stone to reach timber harvest goals in recent years because environmentalists successfully lobbied the Forest Service to reduce the amount of timber cut in the San Juan National Forest, Cain said. He doesn't expect that trend to change.\ And, he predicted that under Clinton, below-cost timber sales could be eliminated. Such sales act as local subsidies, because the government spends more on road-building than it receives by selling the raw wood but creates jobs in the process.\ The loss of those dollars could mean the departure of timber jobs in Colorado, where the government lost $7 million on timber sales last year.\ NUCLEAR WASTE:\ Closure of Rocky Flats on horizon\ The bulk of the nuclear waste generated by Department of Energy military production plants is now stored in the West at Hanford, Wash., Idaho Falls, Idaho, and Rocky Flats, northwest of Denver. The Energy Department has proposed two nuclear waste dumps - one in southern New Mexico for waste with low-level radioactivity and one at the Yucca Mountain facility in Nevada for highly radioactive wastes, such as spent rods from nuclear reactors.\ Melinda Kassen of the Environmental Defense Fund said it's hard to predict how O'Leary will approach safety issues still to be resolved at these sites. But she noted that as a power company executive, O'Leary ""worked hard to site a nuclear disposal storage facility in Minnesota.""\ Under Reagan and Bush, the Energy Department spent $1 billion preparing the underground dump in New Mexico, and it probably will open under Clinton. If it does, two or three truckloads of the waste will roll through Colorado Springs on Interstate 25 daily for up to 25 years.\ Many observers foresee the closure of Rocky Flats, because the United States will have little need for more nuclear weapons in the post-Cold War era. The Energy Department under Bush resisted repeated calls for a shutdown at Rocky Flats, suggesting it might not be closed until sometime in the next century. The facility now employs 7,000 people, and the average salary there is $43,000 a year, so closure could have a big impact on the Denver-area economy.\ Members of the Colorado congressional delegation already have tried to cushion such a blow by trying to make sure that when the costly, massive cleanup of Rocky flats begins, workers who are there now have the first chance at jobs created by the effort.\ CLINTON'S ENVIRONMENTAL TEAM\ HAZEL O'LEARY energy secretary\ O'Leary, 55, most recently was executive vice president for the Northern States Power Co. in Minneapolis. She worked in the Department of Energy during the Carter and Ford administrations. She takes over an agency in the throes of transition: The department's weapons- production role is diminishing with the end of the Cold War.\ AL GORE vice president\ Gore, 44, is a former senator from Tennessee with a reputation as a strong environmentalist who believes the United States needs to be a worldwide leader in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. He also has taken strong positions concerning preservation of pristine rivers and national parks.\ BRUCE BABBITT interior secretary\ A former governor of Arizona, the 54-year-old Babbitt has been president of the League of Conservation Voters and a board member for the Grand Canyon Trust. He has long supported the Endangered Species Act and now is the official most responsible for implementing it in cases such as the one involving the spotted owl.\ MIKE ESPY agriculture secretary\ Espy, 39, had been a House member from Mississippi since 1986. He has aided development of the state's catfish industry, opposed increases in grazing fees and consistently supported a balanced budget amendment. His nomination was widely applauded by the agriculture community.\ PROPOSALS AND PROMISES\ Here are the major proposals and promises President Clinton made about the environment during his campaign.\ Resolve the spotted owl controversy in the Pacific Northwest by bringing environmentalists, loggers and other interests together. He did not specify how.\ Prohibit drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\ Reduce solid and toxic waste as well as air and water pollution.\ Reduce American and worldwide use of fossil fuels and airborne chemicals that destroy the ozone layer."
60,"The Fort Collins Sustainability Group, or FCSG, recently sent the following letter to Sen. Michael Bennet:\Thank you for meeting with members of the Fort Collins environmental community on Jan. 5. The FCSG appreciated the opportunity to share our thoughts and to hear those of others on critical environmental issues.\We'd like to highlight the following ideas brought forward during that meeting:\The carbon emissions reductions in proposed Senate legislation are insufficient to keep global climate change in check.\At a minimum, the United States should reduce its carbon emissions by 35 percent by 2020 with respect to current levels, as recommended by the Union of Concerned Scientists.\A carbon tax may be superior to the ""cap and trade"" policy the Senate is currently considering. Proceeds from such a tax could be redistributed or used to develop infrastructure to help us break our dependence on fossil fuels.\A national renewable energy standard and feed-in tariffs would promote the use of renewable energy.\Mass transit, including Front Range commuter rail would help lower carbon emissions in the transport sector.\Addressing global climate change is critical in order to avoid environmental catastrophe and also provides an opportunity to put people back to work. After the economic meltdown of 2008, it's clear that the ""free market"" is incapable of providing for the common welfare by itself. The government has an important role to play both in creating employment and addressing environmental problems. The climate bill should do both of these things.\Kevin Cross, convener, on behalf of the Fort Collins Sustainability Group"

A growing coalition of Americans who favor a national carbon tax have already garnered support from unexpected places -- including George P. Schultz, who was Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State and Greg Mankiw, economic advisor to President George W. Bush.
\
The Citizens' Climate Lobby, which has a Boulder chapter, favors a revenue-neutral carbon tax, with revenues gained from the carbon generators returning through tax credits to the consumers.
\
A growing number of municipalities, including Boulder, and countries, including Australia, have passed carbon taxes. But despite growing acceptance, the U.S. Congress has been intractable.
\
In the face of inaction, President Barack Obama plans to use the Environmental Protection Agency to limit carbon pollution from power plants. But a national carbon tax would have a much bigger impact on the environment -- and a new study states it would benefit the economy as well.
\
The CCL and the Citizens' Climate Education Corp. contracted a third party to model the revenue-neutral carbon tax proposal. They wanted the disinterested Regional Economic Modeling Inc. to be free from the taint that comes from think tanks. The study concluded that the plan would have a serious impact on carbon emissions -- down to 50 percent of 1990 levels by 2035. And the economy would actually improve: Money would be returned to households, health outcomes would improve and costs associated with carbon would decline.
\
People opposed to a carbon tax are varied, but the ones who say it will dismantle the economy are standing on increasingly shaky ground.
\
Boulder passed its municipal carbon tax in 2006; it was renewed at the ballot box in 2012. Finland was the first to enact a national carbon tax, in 1990. Several other countries followed, all over the world except for the Middle East, and the predicted economic disaster based on those taxes never came to pass.
\
Last year, there were about 100 chapters of the non-partisan CCL. That's almost doubled this year, and there are now four chapters in Colorado. A delegation including the Boulder chapter will be headed to Washington D.C. next week. Six hundred volunteers from around the country will be knocking on the doors of our elected Congress members, bending their ear to talk about the promising news: A revenue-neutral carbon tax would be good for the economy and the environment.
\
We support their self-funded efforts to share what the economic studies have shown, and enthusiastically encourage Colorado's representatives to listen.

This Sunday, Sept. 21, many people from Boulder, and thousands of people from around the country will be demonstrating in New York City to urge greater U.S. and international action to address climate change. The U.N. is holding a Climate Summit on Sept. 23, and more than 120 heads of state/government have committed to attend.
\
What can the United States and other nations do to address this looming, huge issue? There are many reasons why a gradually increasing carbon tax is the best policy solution. For example, a carbon tax is simpler and cheaper to implement than other policies, and potentially more politically acceptable (especially if it revenue neutral). The U.N. should encourage all nations to adopt carbon taxes, and the U.S. should lead the way.
\
The Obama Administration has proposed new regulations on new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants, which is a great start to reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. But we also need a carbon tax to achieve the overall emission reductions many scientists agree are necessary. However, implementing a carbon tax in the U.S. is not likely until we limit the influence of corporate/very wealthy individual campaign contributions and lobbyists.
\
This will not happen overnight, but in the meantime there are a few things we can all do to contribute to the solutions. We can of course start by making our homes more energy efficient, and by driving less, and/or driving more efficient cars, etc. And here's another important action to consider. Ask your financial advisor to help you move all your investments away from the largest fossil fuel companies. The top six investor-owned fossil fuel companies in terms of their historical carbon dioxide emissions are Chevron, Exxon-Mobil, BP, Royal Dutch/Shell, ConocoPhillips, and Peabody Energy. Until/unless these companies agree to publicly support a substantial carbon tax, and agree to publicly disclose all their political contributions, we should completely divest from them.
\
Finally, in addition to thinking about the climate demonstrations in New York, we should spend some time outside on Sunday, and appreciate our beautiful natural environment around Boulder. We should enjoy the fall equinox and be grateful for our moderate weather this summer and fall.

Boulder voters have consistently recognized the importance of the environment and reducing their carbon footprint:
\
In 1959 voters approved the ""Blueline"" Charter Amendment preserving our mountain backdrop from development.
\
In 1967 citizens voted to tax themselves to acquire and manage open space -- the first city in the nation to do so -- and support for open space is still very high.
\
In 1971 a 55-foot building height limitation was passed saving our historic downtown from demolition.
\
Recently, Boulder was the first city in the United States to pass a carbon tax, renewed in the last election by 84 percent of voters, to address climate change.
\
In the last two city elections voters said no to a 20-year franchise with Xcel Energy and authorized the city of Boulder to find a better option to decarbonize, democratize and decentralize our energy supply.
\
Xcel Energy is an investor-owned utility whose purpose is to maximize profits. Xcel earns over $100 million yearly from Boulder alone. In 2011 Xcel chose to outspend citizen groups 10-to-1 in an attempt to defeat the search for a better option.
\
A public utility would have local control. It would invest in our community. And it would allow Boulder's energy supply to be less costly, more efficient and greener for us, and future generations.

The economy has been stuck in first gear going on 5 years now since the great recession, and the outlook is for the same. Technology has eliminated many toll booth and grocery store checker jobs and soon we'll grab i-Pads to order when we enter a restaurant. Additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) bodes well for new online businesses, but not too well for those seeking manufacturing jobs. Even a new steel plant in Youngstown, Ohio (my place of birth), built to fabricate pipe used for natural gas drilling in the Marcellus and Utica Shale basins, will provide far fewer manufacturing jobs than originally anticipated due to automation. So, where are all of our unemployed workers going to find jobs? Sorry, the outlook isn't good and conventional manufacturing jobs are not coming back the United States.
\
At the same time, the world is warming, sea level is rising and we are experiencing catastrophic storms, flooding, drought and raging fires. Many believe that fossil fuel use for power and transportation is the greatest source of greenhouse gases that cause global warming. Others argue that the global warming is a cycle of nature. No matter which side of that argument you are on, you should certainly be alarmed that earlier this year Beijing's Air Quality Index hit a recent memory all time high of AQI = 755! This pollution is far off-the-chart and would trigger health warnings in the U.S. of emergency conditions. It travels around the globe in the jet stream for everyone to experience. Yet, nobody should expect significant government funds to mitigate climate change -- especially with an economy that we have now.
\
We need a way to employ many of the currently unemployed and the new job seekers, while developing a long-term plan to combat global climate change. There is no doubt that a major infrastructure stimulus-type government program is needed to get multitudes of people back to work -- fixing roads and bridges, putting power lines below ground and improving transportation, maybe even light and fast rail where it makes sense. We need to improve support for our educational system and to increase funding for long-term basic science research -- which has led to platform technologies creating more high-technology jobs. With entitlements and defense spending being protected, funding will have to come from increased broad-brush tax increases and expanded tax revenue driven by job creation. So, how do we do that? How do we ""jump-start"" our economy while finding additional revenue to employ millions of Americans, and increase spending on education and research?
\
Our citizens and elected officials need to compromise, find common ground and move forward quickly. Knowing that the best ""deal"" is one where nobody is happy, we need to make concessions for the good of our country and our children. There should be some agreement between the two parties in Washington where the President approves the XL pipeline and opens up some of our federal lands for oil and gas drilling in exchange for a broad carbon tax, a Value Added Tax (VAT) that is focused on the reduction of greenhouse gas generation (GHG). This would improve the economy with more energy jobs, allow us to be an exporter of refined gas/oil products, reduce our dependency on Middle Eastern oil and reduce the local concerns over ""fracking"" in cities and near more populated areas (if more drilling is opened up elsewhere); while at the same time incentivizing entrepreneurial risk takers to create ""green"" jobs. Further, the Canadian tar sands oil will ultimately be developed and none of us wants the pollution that would come out of transporting crude to China and refining there.
\
The U.S. emits 5.5 billion metric tons (mt) of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually. A $30/mt carbon tax would generate $165 billion a year. What would this tax affect? Coal fired electricity costs would be taxed at $0.03 (3 cents) per kW-hr used, natural gas fired at about half that ($0.015/kW-hr used) and wind/solar at near zero. Burning a gallon of gasoline would be taxed at $0.25/gallon. Of course, this tax should be applied globally in order to level the economic playing field. With the vast satellite imagery available, it is well-known where the GHGs are produced. Imports could be taxed based on their GHG emissions at the originating country of export. If this starts a trade war, so be it. I'm sure the Europeans, Japanese, Australians and many others would be supportive. There is no doubt that the lack of environmental and safety regulation in China has contributed substantially to the current economic imbalance and is now threatening global environment and health. The revenue generated by the GHG VAT could be used partially for reducing the debt and partially for supporting an infrastructure-type jobs, education and research program.
\
The free market would determine the winners and the losers. There would be no need for special credits, like wind, since the VAT would provide the incentive to be clean. Likewise, there would be no selecting winners like Solyndra, since the free market would dictate what technologies are best. ""Green"" habits would be rewarded while dirtier habits penalized. New ""green"" manufacturing jobs would be created. The VAT tax collected at the point of consumption is the best means of insuring that those funds are used as prescribed. We don't need anyone ""gaming"" a cap and trade program in which a large fraction of the tax would end up on the balance sheets of big banks.
\
How do we get there? We can start by having those citizens who are intent to ban ""fracking"" to direct their energies to putting a carbon tax in place as a compromise. At the same time, those citizens who are against broad government taxation should be pushing for approval of the XL pipeline and drilling on public lands as a compromise to the carbon tax. If the President flat out rejects the XL pipeline, it would be a lost opportunity for negotiating something that is a win-win. The same is true if he flat out approves it. Details would have to be worked out and a global carbon tax phased in, but this would be one giant leap in the right direction for our kid's futures. And remember, the best ""deal"" is one where nobody is happy.

\
Boulder will launch a pilot program this fall that could help shape its future commercial energy-efficiency policies.
\
Getting businesses to reduce their energy use will be key to meeting the city's greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, officials say. Energy use accounts for 76 percent of Boulder's greenhouse gas emissions, and industrial and commercial electricity use makes up nearly 83 percent of the community's total energy use.
\
A consultant has recommended that the city put more than half of the $1.8 million it gets each year from the Climate Action Plan tax toward incentivizing private-sector energy-efficiency investments, should voters choose to renew the tax in November.
\
The first step likely will be requiring commercial property owners to measure and track their energy use and disclose that information to the city -- and perhaps to the public. The Environmental Protection Agency offers a free online program to help businesses do just that.
\
The idea is that by seeing where they're using energy, businesses will be more motivated and better informed to make energy-efficiency upgrades. If potential tenants -- who usually pay utility bills -- can also see that information, they can use it when choosing where to lease space, similar to the way consumers use EnergyStar ratings when they buy appliances.
\
Boulder is looking for a diverse group of businesses to participate in a pilot ""benchmarking"" program, set to launch in September, and the city is offering $75,000 in additional incentives from the existing EnergySmart program -- a collaboration between the county and the city to make it easier for property owners to make energy-efficiency upgrades -- to entice large commercial landlords to participate, said Elizabeth Vasatka, business sustainability coordinator for the city's Local Environmental Action Division.
\
The information will be used to develop a mandatory tracking and reporting program. The goal is to put that program in place by the end of 2013.
\
Tracking energy use better should help close an ""information gap,"" Vasatka said,
\
""We know a lot of property owners are implementing energy efficiencies,"" she said. ""We still don't know how our buildings perform.""
\
The Boulder City Council will discuss the commercial energy-efficiency strategy, along with the progress made on a study about whether Boulder should start a municipal electric utility and the prospects for renewing the CAP tax, also known as the carbon tax, at a study session on Tuesday.
\
Mandates cause concern
\
City officials are also considering whether they should eventually require businesses to meet more stringent energy-efficiency requirements, similar to the SmartRegs program, which mandates that residential landlords upgrade their buildings by 2018.
\
That prospect concerns some local businesses and the Boulder Chamber.
\
""We have some major concerns about mandatory upgrades,"" said Angelique Espinoza, the chamber's public affairs manager. ""The idea of having a pilot where businesses help the city understand the reporting requirements -- it's not necessarily businesses' favorite idea, but we can work with that.""
\
Espinoza said the business community might not support an extension of the CAP tax if the city is moving toward mandates.
\
""If it's focused on positive, incentive-based programming, that's something we can get behind,"" she said. ""If it's really emphasizing mandates and regulations, we don't feel like we need a tax for that.""
\
City officials have indicated that the CAP tax revenue would provide rebates and other programs to help commercial building owners meet any mandatory program, as is currently the case with the residential SmartRegs program. However, meeting the city's climate goals would still require significant private-sector investment.
\
Espinoza said SmartRegs is not a good model for the commercial sector, where businesses and buildings differ radically in their energy use.
\
Boulder Mayor Matt Appelbaum said he would prefer to work with the business community on a voluntary basis, but mandates might help ""level the playing field"" in an environment where property owners might feel like they're at a disadvantage if they make voluntary upgrades.
\
""If we can find ways to not make something mandatory but get people on board in sufficient numbers, of course that's the right approach,"" said Appelbaum, who agreed that the commercial sector is much more complicated. ""I'm not sure that's going to work. Sometimes voluntary approaches work and sometimes, frankly, they don't.""
\
Split incentive
\
Not all business owners oppose mandates.
\
""Think about automobiles,"" said Shaun Oshman, who has done a number of energy-efficiency upgrades to iSupportU, his information technology support, web design and computer repair business. ""They used to not have standards for emissions. Now they do. It's probably affected the cost of vehicles, but that's OK. It's part of being part of a society. You have to be responsible. When people aren't being responsible, it affects everyone.""
\
Oshman has realized significant savings -- reducing his energy bill from $275 a month to $150 a month -- by installing LED lighting, ceiling fans and other improvements. That ability to reap savings gave Oshman an obvious incentive to make the up-front investment.
\
For other businesses, though, the cost-benefit analysis is more complicated because the lease terms require the landlord to make the improvements while the tenant would realize the savings.
\
""The biggest challenge is that there is a split incentive,"" Vasatka said. ""The city is trying to create efficiency programs for both property owners and tenants. The challenge is to break down some of the innate barriers that exist.""
\
The city has provided energy-adviser services, rebates and incentives to 1,300 businesses through the EnergySmart program and spent $300,000 on commercial sector programs, leveraging another $400,000 from Boulder County, which is administering a federal grant that helps fund EnergySmart and that expires next year.
\
Espinoza said that since the carbon tax revenue has primarily been used on residential programs so far, the commercial sector should be given more time to do voluntary upgrades under a more developed commercial EnergySmart program.
\
In the meantime, Vasatka said the city hopes to get some 50 businesses to participate in the pilot energy tracking and reporting program this fall.
\
""We want to get a really good flavor of the types of buildings, the uses, the sizes, the resources needed in the future,"" she said.
\
As part of that, Boulder will release $75,000 for large commercial property owners -- those with 10 buildings or more -- who commit to making at least five energy-efficiency upgrades. Those landlords would also have to measure and track the energy use in those buildings to see what savings were achieved.
\
Boulder also plans to track energy use in 28 city-owned facilities that represent 85 percent of the city government's energy use.
\
""You can't manage what you don't measure, and if you don't measure, you don't know where you are in your goals and how you're performing,"" Vasatka said.

What a surprise!
\
On May 11, the Obama administration gave conditional approval to allow Shell to start drilling for oil in the Arctic Ocean (""Seattle site, like it or not, becomes Shell's Arctic base,"" Daily Camera, May 15). After fighting hard to create EPA regulations to limit emissions from coal power plants and resisting the massive pressure to approve Keystone XL pipeline, why would the Obama administration want to approve oil drilling in such a hazardous area? This is an area which is only now becoming accessible because of all the past global warming.
\
If humanity burns all the known fossil fuel reserves, the future climate will be dramatically warmer. But if we are not going to burn all the known fossil fuels and will leave some of them in the ground, then why not start by avoiding the most inaccessible and most environmentally sensitive to spills areas like the Arctic Ocean?
\
How sad it is that we cannot halt our endless burning of ever more fossil fuels because the solution to the problem is well known. There is wide agreement among economists that the only way to stop global warming is to price the externality -- put a price on carbon based on the damage it is doing to the environment. And if the revenue from the carbon tax was returned equitably to all American families, then the impact of the carbon tax would be minimal. Tell Senator Cory Gardner, Senator Michael Bennet, and Congressman Jared Polis that you expect action on a revenue-neutral carbon tax now. All it will take to solve this problem is for a few of our representatives to have the courage to make the future of the country and the planet their top priority.

\
Boulder voters overwhelmingly approved a five-year extension of the city's innovative carbon tax and a 20-year extension of its 0.25 percent sales tax for parks and recreation.
\
The extension of the Climate Action Plan tax, or carbon tax, on energy use allows the city to continue a suite of energy efficiency and renewable energy programs that officials say are critical to continuing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\
With 64 percent counted as of 10:30 p.m. Tuesday out of an estimated 173,890 ballots cast countywide, 82 percent of city voters favored extending the CAP tax, and 17.9 percent opposed it.
\
""It's really heartening to see that Boulderites supported it so heavily, which keeps Boulder in the forefront of the world with the actions we're taking,"" Boulder Mayor Matt Appelbaum said. ""It allows us to continue as a model for other communities in terms of programs that are cost-effective and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and are just a good return on investment.""
\
First approved by voters in 2006, the Climate Action Plan tax on utilities generates around $1.9 million for the city. The tax rate varies by usage and sector. The average annual cost to residents is $21. The average annual cost to businesses is $94, and for industrial customers, it's $9,600.
\
City Manager Jane Brautigam said in a news release that the results confirm the community's commitment to the environment.
\
""The Boulder community has once again proven its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change,"" Brautigam said. ""Boulder remains a strong steward of the environment, and I'm proud of our city for being a leader in the region, the state and the nation.""
\
The tax pays for energy-efficiency and renewable-energy programs, including rebates, credits and ""energy audits"" for homeowners and businesses.
\
Boulder's parks tax was approved by even higher margins.
\
Late Tuesday, 85 percent supported the tax extension, and 14.9 percent opposed it.
\
The tax, which generated $7.1 million in 2012 for parks and recreation, wouldn't have expired until 2015. However, city officials wanted to put it on the ballot this year to provide more stability for budget planning. The tax will now expire in 2035.
\
The 0.25 percent sales tax contributes 27 percent of the parks department's budget. Possible uses of the tax include development of the southern part of Valmont City Park, athletic field improvements, neighborhood park improvements and recreation center upgrades, as well as maintenance of existing facilities.
\
City voters also gave their approval to two charter amendments, one of which will allow the city to offer 30-year rather than 20-year leases to community institutions that rent public property. Organizations such as the Boulder Municipal Airport, the Colorado Chautauqua Association, the Dairy Center for the Arts, A Spice of Life Event Center and the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art have said being restricted to 20-year leases makes long-term financing difficult.
\
Boulder voters had twice before rejected charter amendments to allow 40-year leases, but they approved the 30-year lease provision 64 percent to 36 percent.
\
They also approved a charter amendment that will allow City Council members to be paid for up to 52 meetings a year, instead of four meetings per month, by 70.5 percent to 29.5 percent.

70,"\Next up in Congress: tax reform. President Trump, Senate Majority Leader McConnell, and House Speaker Ryan have crafted a partisan tax plan that provides more giveaways to the wealthy, paid for by the middle class and enormous budget deficit increases. Estimates suggest a quarter of middle-class households would see their taxes rise under the Republican plan. As a Democratic member of Congress, I haven't been afforded a say in the GOP tax plan crafted behind closed doors, but I refuse to sit idly by as they push it forward as the only option.\We can all agree; we need a fairer, simpler tax code. But when we talk about overhauling the tax structure, our goal should be to create jobs, grow the economy, and make smart investments in our future, not provide handouts to special interests and plunge our nation deeper into debt. We can get on track by first leveling the playing field between fossil fuels and renewable energy.\That is why I have drafted a 21st-century, detailed tax plan for a clean-energy future that uses tax dollars efficiently, has the potential to reduce income taxes, creates jobs, strengthens our national security ,and moves our country forward.\My plan, co-signed by 15 other members of the Congressional Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC), chronicles loopholes and limitations in the current tax structure, and offers innovative and bold job-creating ideas for tax policy. The choice is clear, and I am hopeful that Democrats and Republicans will choose to get on board with my fiscally responsible plan that will unleash American innovation and job opportunities.\Colorado's booming clean-energy economy demonstrates why a plan like mine can be successful across all 50 states. Our economy is diversified and growing, as we are leading the way on clean energy. Fourteen percent of our net power comes from wind energy. We have over 62,000 clean-energy jobs, and our methane capture rule has already served as a model for the national rule.\Yes, a clean-energy tax plan will help foster a healthy environment and combat climate change, but those are not the only arguments for pursuing environmental sustainability in the tax code. The fiscal argument, by itself, should be enough to motivate progress.\A component of my clean-energy plan — a ""carbon price"" that charges corporations for every ton of carbon produced instead of taxing their profits or our income — helps ensure that no corporation is off-loading the harm pollution causes onto others. As it stands now, corporate polluters freely profit off the carbon that makes Americans sicker and our weather more volatile, costing taxpayers billions of dollars. It is only fair that we start holding them accountable for it.\Experts on both sides of the aisle have backed the concept, including former Republican Secretaries of State James Baker and George Shultz, and former Republican Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. We expect that a $25-per-ton surcharge on carbon would generate $1 trillion or more over 10 years. That's a trillion dollar tax cut for the rest of us! It would address the negative and expensive externalities of pollution, while simultaneously promoting massive economic activity and expansion. With the revenues from a carbon tax, we can reduce taxes across the board and bring back millions of manufacturing jobs that are needed to build clean-energy infrastructure and upgrade our grid.\Just as critically, my plan details how to finally end the dozens of sweetheart deals that industries like oil and gas currently enjoy. By simply repealing the domestic manufacturing deduction for oil production, coal, and fossil fuels, and the dual capacity taxpayer rules for claiming foreign tax credits (largely used by oil companies, they provide a subsidy for drilling in foreign countries), we can save $23.9 billion in special-interest tax breaks over 10 years and profitable companies will benefit by paying less in tax.\These are just a few of the more than 20 priorities I lay out that the federal government should take on tax reform. Together we can unleash American ingenuity, reduce taxes, create more jobs, and improve our public health and environment.\Jared Polis represents Colorado's second congressional district in the House of Representatives. He is vice-chair of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition.\Credit: By Jared Polis"
71,"The recently concluded ""fiscal cliff"" agreement featured much sound and fury but accomplished relatively little. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the deal will add $4 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years compared with simply allowing Bush-era tax cuts to expire. And the Republican majority in the House of Representatives is now calling for annual deficits to be reduced solely by cutting Social Security, Medicare and other vital social programs.\The twin notions that government social spending should be cut during periods of high unemployment and that governments can't create jobs are two of the phoniest ideas promoted by the failed Romney presidential campaign. Cutting government spending when unemployment is high leads to a vicious cycle of decreased demand for goods and services and even higher unemployment. Teachers, firefighters, police officers and postal workers offer living proof that governments do indeed create jobs. These jobs are both socially necessary and help keep people in the private sector employed when government workers spend their wages on things like groceries, housing and other consumer goods.\Another area in which government spending is badly needed is the mitigation of environmental problems, chief among which is climate change. Infrastructure improvements and services to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to protect against the effects of the global warming that already is under way are critical, and will assuredly not be provided in the amounts necessary by the private sector alone.\New programs to address environmental problems would have the added benefit of reducing unemployment, which should be seen as the destroyer of human aspirations and waste of talent that it is. The current overall U.S. unemployment rate of 7.8 percent is bad enough, but the figure skyrockets to 21.6 percent for white youths and to 40.5 percent for African-American youths. Spending on environmental programs should include special provisions for those groups suffering the highest unemployment rates.\An excellent potential source of revenue for paying for these needed programs is a carbon tax. Such a tax would be imposed on fuels in proportion to the amount of carbon dioxide each dumps into the atmosphere when used. In addition to raising revenue for federal environmental mitigation efforts, it would discourage the use of fossil fuels, such as coal, and encourage the use of renewables, such as wind-generated electricity.\Another potential source of revenue for expanded federal environmental programs is reducing the military budget. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the U.S. spent $711 billion on its military in 2011 -- nearly five times as much as China, the country with the next highest military budget. Perhaps we'd be safe if we spent only twice as much as China -- in which case $425 billion per year would be available for other uses. Given the high investment needed to create each military-related job compared with that required to create jobs in education, health care or mass transit, such a shift could result in significant employment gains.\The U.S. public has been held in thrall by the military industry, the fossil fuel industry and a dysfunctional national political establishment for far too long. The Fort Collins Community Action Network urges people to contact Sen. Mark Udall, Sen. Michael Bennet and Rep. Jared Polis to demand that they support increased spending on jobs and the environment, a carbon tax and cuts to the military budget.\Kevin Cross is a member of the Fort Collins Community Action Network Spokes Council.

Environmental leaders were stunned by a presidential election that defied the polls and put into power a man who calls climate change a hoax and has vowed to do away with the Environmental Protection Agency, take the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement and cancel the Clean Power Plan. While President-elect Donald Trump's stances on energy and climate change policy remain murky, his victory has galvanized COP leaders who hope to undo President Barack Obama's climate legacy - and environmental leaders who say his pronouncements cannot change the fact that the planet is heating up. ""This election, nobody went to the ballot box voting for dirtier air and dirtier water,"" says Anna Aurilio, D.C. director for Environment America. ""So we have to mobilize.""

Latinos voter surge - in the West, at least
\
Leading up to Election Day, a historic increase in Latino voter turnout seemed possible, and while Latino support for Democrats waned, that hypothesis proved true. According to Pew Research, national exit polls suggest Latinos did make up a larger share of voters in the past, although more went Republican than in the past. Nationwide, 65 percent of Latinos supported Hillary Clinton, while 29 percent voted for Trump. Compare that to 2012, when Obama won 71 percent of the Hispanic vote (Mitt Romney secured 27 percent). Compared to the rest of the country, though, Latino voters in Western states voted resoundingly for Clinton over Trump. In Arizona, 84 percent of Latinos voted for Clinton (compared to only 56 percent of Hispanics voting for Obama in 2008). The growing clout of Hispanics, though, wasn't enough to flip the state, as some analysts predicted. Arizona went to Trump, 50 percent to Clinton's 45.

This week's question: The U.S. Senate failed by one vote on Tuesday to send a bill authorizing the Keystone Pipeline to the President's desk, but Republicans promised it will be back with the new Congress. What's your take?
\
Keystone XL Phase III will be a test of America's sincerity about greenhouse gas reduction. Keystone's present pipelines join the cobweb of vulnerable pipelines across the U.S. The outcome of the KXL debate will determine if we approve of strip-mining the dirtiest tar or bitumen in the world. The bitumen must be heated to 1,500 degrees and piped 2,147 miles from Alberta to Texas gulf refineries. An August 2014 report shows that there are four times more greenhouse gases from this molasses-like tar extraction than conventional oil drilling.
\
With the glut of oil and natural gas from widespread drilling in Colorado and other states, why should we tolerate pollution costs of contaminating First Nation/Native American land and water, cleaning up pipeline spills, and refining the dirty crude in Texas? Only to ship the gasoline to China and other world markets. Here we have the classic example of giant corporations like TransCanada and Big Oil ripping off unaware citizens. Instead of billions of dollars going into Koch Brothers pockets we should be investing in energy efficiencies and renewables.
\
Let me suggest that the 140 million year-old (Cretaceous Period) viscous tar sands be reserved for FUTURE decades when cheap gasoline is gone and the world needs the remaining hydrocarbons for making pharmaceuticals, fabrics, plastic and other critical products. 2015 will be the year those who think global warming is a hoax will have their pocketbooks challenged. It will be hypocrisy-testing time.

\
There are two idealistic types of energy independence. National energy independence: a self-sufficient economy with no need for foreign oil. Individual energy independence: a wholesale personal reduction in fossil fuel consumption. If we each achieve the latter, the former will be rendered irrelevant.
\
The entire debate over the construction of the Keystone pipeline is also startlingly irrelevant. Proponents claim it will create jobs -- yet of those, TransCanada estimates only 10-15 percent would be local hires, the majority of those temporary. Opponents counter that the extraction of this oil would emit a greater quantity of greenhouse gases (between 17 and 300 percent, depending on who you ask) over traditional oil -- yet even a pipeline denial would not protect the sands from distribution through other conduits.
\
Meanwhile, economists would point out that it does not even matter -- at current oil prices, even with the delivery infrastructure, the sands would lie unused because their complicated extraction renders them too expensive to compete.
\
This isn't about the pipeline. The importance of Keystone XL has somehow inflated to create a must-win proving ground where each political faction will draw its line in the proverbial tar sand.
\
The only thing more appalling than the amount of time and money wasted on arguments about Keystone XL is the fact that we are still even debating strategies to help sustain our energy dependence instead of simply investigating how we could thrive off of less.
\
Mara Abbott, abbottmarak@gmail.com
\

\
The debate over the Keystone Pipeline has taken on far greater significance than the pipeline itself.
\
According to the U.S. State Department, building the pipeline will create 3,900 construction jobs and a total of 42,000 jobs for about two years. It will result in 35 new permanent jobs. It won't reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is foreign oil and once it is refined in Texas, it will be exported. Extracting oil from the tar sands creates about 17 percent more carbon dioxide over other oil fields, but the extraction will happen with or without the pipeline.
\
So what is the debate about? The Canadian tar sands contain some of the dirtiest oil found to date. It has to be surface mined or steam injected. Both these methods pollute huge amounts of water, spew voluminous poisons into the air and wreak visible havoc on the surrounding environment. Should we allow big energy to extract fossil fuels anywhere at any cost? At what point should we insist that we protect the health and safety of our children, their children and the planet?
\
The Keystone Pipeline has sparked an important conversation about our energy future. Photographs of the Canadian tar sands are a window into a dystopian future created by ignoring the science on pollution and climate change in the name of short-term prosperity for a very few. We must move towards cleaner energy. Let's get going before the tar sands are our only option.

Lewis Carroll taught us all that ""Contrariwise if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic."" And so it goes. Once again on Tuesday down the rabbit hole of the Keystone Pipeline we went to a world where illogical actions become logical.
\
Want to elect a Republican senator from Louisiana? Have Democratic leader Harry Reid call the question on Keystone XL and then and watch as one Democratic senator after another cast their votes to effectively seal the defeat of Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu. Want to prove that our President is a leader? Let everyone know he can't issue a permit to build Keystone XL until the Nebraska Supreme Court rules on a local land owner's lawsuit and allows the President to act. Want to handle growing demand for fossil fuels? Reduce supply. Worried about the potential environmental risk of a pipeline spill? Replace the pipeline with thousands of railroad tanker cars.
\
But we residents of Boulder County above all people should understand the logic of illogical positions. After all we have long lived with PLAN Boulder's ""plan"" to preserve our way of life by limiting housing which forces people to commute to work which creates daily traffic jams of historic proportions which we solve by having a Transportation Department turn four lane roads into two lane ones.

\
We opined on the Keystone XL in March of last year. At that time it looked to me like it was a done deal. So, I thought, why didn't we forget the pipeline and explore a carbon tax. The theory here was that a properly set carbon tax would internalize the externalities generated by carbon fuels. Pledge the proceeds to deficit reduction in order to get Republican support. A fanciful idea, but I still like it.
\
Things have changed in a year and a half. The deal isn't done. Based on what I heard the President say, the project won't generate much benefit to the USA. That tells me that he will not approve the project. So what looked like a done deal is in fact a dead duck. I note that the Keystone-XL.com website cites benefits to ""North America."" I reviewed the ""Quick Facts."" The pipeline ends at Steele City, Nebraska. (Steele City? There is a beautiful picture of Steele City on Wikipedia. Steele City had sixty-one residents in 2010.) The State Department claims minimal environmental impact. But it no longer looks to me like the benefits to the USA outweigh the costs. How about a trans-Canada route? Then at least the costs and benefits would occur in the same country. The Keystone website claims that ""the silent majority is screaming"" in support of the project. I'm not hearing it.

There is only one meaningful response to the horrific oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and that is for America to stop messing around when it comes to designing its energy and environmental future. The only meaningful response to this man-made disaster is a man-made energy bill that would finally put in place an American clean-energy infrastructure that would set our country on a real, long-term path to ending our addiction to oil.
\
That is so obviously the right thing for our environment, the right thing for our national security, the right thing for our economic security and the right thing to promote innovation. But it means that we have to stop messing around with idiotic ""Drill, baby, drill"" nostrums, feel-good Earth Day concerts and the paralyzing notion that the American people are not prepared to do anything serious to change our energy mix.
\
This oil spill is to the environment what the subprime mortgage mess was to the markets -- both a wake-up call and an opportunity to galvanize a constituency for radical change that overcomes the powerful lobbies and vested interests that want to keep us addicted to oil.
\
If President Obama wants to seize this moment, it is there for the taking. We have one of the worst environmental disasters in American history on our hands. We have a public deeply troubled by what they`ve seen already -- and they`ve probably seen only the first reel of this gulf horror show. And we have a bipartisan climate/energy/jobs bill ready to be introduced in the Senate -- produced by Sens. John Kerry, Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham -- that would set a price on carbon and begin to shift us to a system of cleaner fuels and greater energy efficiency, and unlock an avalanche of private capital to the clean energy market.
\
American industry is ready to act and is basically saying to Washington: ""Every major country in the world, starting with China, is putting in clear, long-term market rules to stimulate clean energy -- except America. Just give us some clear rules, and we`ll do the rest.""
\
The Kerry-Lieberman-Graham bill is an important step in that direction. It is far from perfect. It includes support for more off-shore drilling, nuclear power and concessions to coal companies. In light of the spill, we need to make this bill better. At a minimum, we need much tighter safeguards on off-shore drilling. There is going to be a lot of pressure to go even further, but we need to remember that even if we halted all off-shore drilling, all we would be doing is moving the production to other areas outside the U.S., probably with even weaker environmental laws.
\
Somehow a compromise has to be found to move forward on this bill -- or one like it. But even before the gulf oil spill, this bill was in limbo because the White House and Senate Democrats broke a promise to Graham, the lone Republican supporting this effort, not to introduce a controversial immigration bill before energy. At the same time, Obama has kept his support low-key, fearing that if he loudly endorses a price on carbon, Republicans will be screaming ""carbon tax"" and ""gasoline tax"" in the 2010 midterm elections.
\
Bottom line: This bill has no chance to pass unless Obama gets behind it with all his power, mobilizes the public and rounds up the votes. He has to lead from the front, not the rear. Responding to this oil spill could well become the most important leadership test of the Obama presidency. The president has always had the right instincts on energy, but he is going to have to decide just how much he wants to rise to this occasion -- whether to generate just an emergency response that over months ends the spill or a systemic response that over time ends our addiction. Needless to say, it would be a lot easier for the president to lead if more than one Republican in the Senate was ready to lift a finger to help him.
\
Our dependence on crude oil is not just a national-security or climate problem. Some 40 percent of America`s fish catch comes out of the gulf, whose states also depend heavily on coastal tourism. In addition, the Chandeleur Islands off the Louisiana coast are part of the Breton National Wildlife Refuge. It was created by Teddy Roosevelt and is one of our richest cornucopias of biodiversity.
\
As the energy consultant David Rothkopf likes to say, sometimes a problem reaches a point of acuity where there are just two choices left: bold action or permanent crisis. This is such a moment for our energy system and environment.
\
If we settle for just an incremental response to this crisis -- a ""Hey, that`s our democracy. What more can you expect?"" -- we`ll be sorry. You can`t fool Mother Nature. She knows when we`re just messing around. Mother Nature operates by her own iron laws. And if we violate them, there is no lobby or big donor to get us off the hook. No, what`s gone will be gone. What`s ruined will be ruined. What`s extinct will be extinct -- and later, when we`re finally ready to stop messing around, it will be too late.

In general, I believe government should play a very limited role in economic development, which is best left to the marketplace unfettered by government regulation. The Legislature should foster an environment of less government, less regulation and lower taxes. Specifically, the business personal property tax should be eliminated.\2. No, more can be done to address this critical issue facing the state of Colorado. Specifically, the state needs to enforce the applicable laws already in place and add legislation that would require secure and verifiable documents as proof of citizenship to register to vote.\3. Overall, the barriers in energy development must be removed with streamlining solar permitting and promoting an environment of regulatory certainty for energy development. Generally, government's role in energy development should be limited but should promote research and development of energy, including renewable energy, with eliminating regulations that inhibit such development.\JoSePh alSuP\Party: Democrat\No response received from candidate.\State Senate District 10\Bill caDMan\Party: Republican\age: 48\employment:\Colorado state Senate\Self-employed marketing, direct mail, graphic design\how to reach him: Phone: 570-9300; fax: 570-0820; e-mail: Cadman4colorado @yahoo.com\education: Bachelor of Arts, California State University\civic involvement:\Chairman, Colorado Statewide Internet Portal Authority\Board member, Chins-Up Youth and Family Services\Board member, Partners Youth Mentoring\Volunteer director, National Day of Prayer, Colorado Springs\Military service: Army, 1982-84, specialist 4th class\answers:\1. Colorado must resist with all resolve any efforts to force our energy producers into cap and trade programs and carbon tax schemes. Adding exorbitant costs to doing business in this state through these onerous, punitive taxing schemes will have a devastating effect on our economy at both the business and consumer levels.\2. A great first step would be to pass a bill I have offered, twice killed by the Democrats, to create the crime of trespassing for illegal aliens. This simple statute would offer the same deterrent effect that we seek in most criminal statutes, providing punishment for illegal behavior and activity.\3. The state should play an active role in helping any energy provider, renewable or otherwise, to acquire necessary permitting for transmission and generation from all energy sources. With the Western region of the U.S. facing a deficit of electricity generation, seeking only green energy or none will surely leave us with the latter.\Diane Whitley\Party: Democrat\age: 49\employment: Self-employed, The Funny Farm, Calhan\how to reach her: Phone: 347-0296;\e-mail: ojosdeangel@hotmail.com\education:\Associate degree, law enforcement/ security, Gloucester, N.J., County College;\Firefighter 1, Gloucester County Fire Academy\civic involvement\Past chairwoman, Paulsboro Environmental Commission\Past spokeswoman, Delaware Valley Concerned Citizens\Volunteer firefighter, Billingsport, N.J.\Democratic Party Senate District 10 chairperson\Military service: None\answers:\1. Re-establish funding priorities: Stop interfering with small business via unnecessary regulation. Stop diverting taxpayer monies to for-profit private enterprise. Generate new jobs through alternative energy technology and innovation; improve education, crime prevention and infrastructure to attract new business to the area. Improve transportation to make us tourist friendly.\2. Immigration is a federal problem. We shouldn't pass new laws to compensate for federal failings, as that would require double taxation of our residents. Residents have already paid for the federal government to control the problem. We need to hold the federal government accountable and, if necessary, sue for compliance.\3. Alternative energy is the new economy: We need to lead in this industry to create jobs, strengthen business and stimulate the economy. We should provide incentives for green industries to locate here, and incentives for small farmers and ranchers to set aside land for wind and solar energy production.\State Senate District 12\keith king\Party: Republican\age: 60\employment: Charter school administrator how to reach him: Phone: 576-6149; fax: 719-528-7006; e-mail: keith@keith king.org\education:\Bachelor of Science, Colorado State University-Pueblo\Master's degree, Oregon State University\civic involvement:\Colorado House of Representatives District 21, 1999-2007\National Assessment Governing Board\Colorado Charter School Institute Board\Colorado League of Charter Schools board member\Military service: None\answers:\1.

Bill Ritter's $321 million energy tax increase on energy production.\2. Continue aggressive law enforcement of arresting those who traffic illegal immigrants through the state; unless services are federally mandated, illegal aliens must not get state government services; prevent illegal immigrants from having the opportunity to vote in the state of Colorado.\3. Create a business friendly environment that encourages utility companies to invest in renewable energy if their customers want it; create clean coal tax credits for utilities to produce a stable supply of energy cheaper. This will allow utilities the opportunity to produce higher priced renewable energy at a more economical price; reduce government regulations on the utility industry so they can produce what the customer wants when they want it.\Pete lee\Party: Democrat\age: 61\employment: Attorney\how to reach him: Phone: 632-1165; e-mail: sepetelee@aol.com\education:\Bachelor of Arts, Ohio Wesleyan University\Law degree, University of Akron\civic involvement:\Pikes Peak Mental Health Board of Directors\Colorado Springs School District 11 Board Budget Committee and Drop-out Student Recovery Task Force\Authored House Bill 08-1117, Restorative Justice in the Children's Code, Pikes Peak and Manitou Springs Restorative Justice councils\Colorado Springs Private Industry Council and Manpower Planning Council, National Alliance of Business, Metro Director Military service: None\answers:\1. Most jobs are created by small businesses, so we need to support them. Raise or eliminate the business personal property tax exemption, provide tax incentives for job creating businesses to relocate here, streamline the business tax code and regulatory requirements, encourage local entrepreneurship, (""economic gardening""), to assist small local businesses to expand.\2. Illegal immigration is a federal problem with state consequences. Our Legislature's many bills to penalize employers who hire undocumented workers and deny them benefits, though well intended, have been largely ineffective. We need to hold Congress accountable and support a federal immigration policy that satisfies both our employment and security needs.\3. The government should encourage the advancement of renewable energy by creating and expanding tax incentives for consumers to use it, creating research tax credits that promote the growth of the renewable energy industry and encourage the commercialization of viable technologies. Colorado should offer incentives for renewable energy companies to relocate to Colorado."
76,"When Mike Battaglia walked into the woods of the Pike National Forest on a sunny, late winter day, he pointed to the mature ponderosa pines — their needles assembled into bulbous groups, their burnt-orange bark furrowed into scaly plates and the buds of their egg-shaped cones.\Their plum branches towered over smatterings of young Douglas firs, brittle juniper bushes and dead litter. The position of their limbs — far enough from the ground to escape the reach of flames running on the forest floor — is part of why Battaglia loves these trees.\“Ponderosa pines are tough,” said the Fort Collins-based U.S. Forest Service research forester. “They can handle fire and drought.”\But then, he noted the saplings tall enough to prove that wildfire — natural or prescribed — has not run through the hill just south of the town of Buffalo Creek. A spot like this should burn every 20 to 40 years, Battaglia said, and it hasn’t.\If a wildfire sparks here, fast-moving flames could explode out of the abundance of dry fuels. That, in turn, could hurt soil retention, watershed health, wildlife habitat and even carbon emissions.\Colorado forests have emitted more carbon dioxide — the primary greenhouse gas contributing to climate change — than they have absorbed since 1990, according to a new analysis by the nonprofit American Forests. Years spent combating the maelstrom of flames, beetle infestations, drought and other aggressors have compromised the forests’ collective immune system.\Trees removed about 16 percent of atmospheric carbon released by human activities in the U.S. in 2011 and between 10 percent and 20 percent each year, the Forest Service estimates. But, as forests in the Colorado Rockies are destroyed by severe fire and massive beetle kills-offs — two well-documented harbingers of climate change — one of the Earth’s prime defense mechanisms against a warming planet erodes.\“We know climate change is happening, so how do we prepare the landscape for it?” Battaglia said. He is among those setting aside despair and opting to search for solutions to save the state’s vast forests.\Larger, more calamitous wildfires started to consistently hit Colorado in the 1990s, notably the 12,000-acre Buffalo Creek fire in 1996. Coloradans’ ears would perk up at the mention of a new conflagration, Battaglia said. Everything changed when the Hayman fire razed more than 137,000 acres of the Pike National Forest during an anomalously dry 2002.\Unlike blazes of the past that burned moderately with pockets of high-severity areas, 43 percent of the Hayman fire burn area was scorched, Colorado State University researchers found. In areas with few if any surviving trees, the dominant species — ponderosa pine — struggled to regenerate at lower elevation 12 years later, according to a 2014 survey.\“The landscape was once dominated by ponderosa pine and some Douglas fir,” said Marin Chambers, the paper’s lead scientist and a research associate at the Colorado Forest Restoration Institute. “Now, in that same spot in a high-severity burn area, you’d see it’s completely devoid of trees, except for some standing dead. But most have fallen down at this point.”\The seeds of ponderosa pines, which are heavy and generally cannot disperse more than two tree heights away from their parent trees, toiled to spread and root across the blistered hillsides. Even with enough precipitation, few seeds sprouted and rooted in the singed soil, restricting the forest’s range.\Chambers said the research, published in 2016, is an attempt to understand the future of forests, specifically how they rebound from major disturbances amidst climate change. In parts of the Hayman fire burn scar, that could mean a decadeslong absence of the conifer trees that Coloradans once wound through on hikes, bikes and horseback.\But, as Chambers’ colleague Paula Fornwalt found, other flora are flourishing where the trees once grew. There, a community of native species — blue grama, hairy golden aster, various sedges — as well as less common plants like mullein have found a home.\“We can talk about fire (like the Hayman) being catastrophic for trees,” Fornwalt said, “but the same language can’t be applied to understory, which seems to be pretty resilient. Not only that, it seems to thrive.”\Scientists also found American three-toed woodpeckers nesting in the recently killed and dying trees where they could forage for wood-boring and bark beetles. Though less common where trees have vanished, the black and white bird found ideal habitat in moderately burned areas.\The collage of ecological research complicates the narrative that wildfire is exclusively a predator, consuming every living creature in its path. Though a landscape may not resemble how modern Coloradans remember it, life will return.\“In my mind, we should think about the ecosystem as a whole and recognize that some areas are doing OK and some aren’t doing so well,” Fornwalt said. “It’s analogous to thinking about your health: Maybe your blood pressure is high, but your weight is good and cholesterol are good. We’re holistic and paint a picture that way to avoid blanket statements.”\But, it’s the loss of the forest and its ability to capture carbon that frightens David Cleaves.\With more sound forest management, trees could sequester enough carbon emissions to offset between $125.5 billion and more than $1.5 trillion in costs in the U.S., the Forest Service estimates. These totals are based on the avoided social costs of carbon emissions, including the destruction of property from flooding and other natural disasters, reduced agricultural yields from drought and exacerbation of health problems like asthma and other respiratory issues.\Cleaves, the former climate change adviser to the chief of the Forest Service, believes that restoring forest health is as much of a “key strategic asset” to the fight against warming as economic solutions, including a carbon tax and cap-and-trade programs.\“Our central mission is to help mainstream forests as solutions to climate change, both from the greenhouse gas management side and the side of adaptation to climate change,” Cleaves said.\But the viability of this goal was in question after Cleaves and American Forests analyzed the forestry inventory data for Intermountain West states to determine the carbon stored in live, dead standing and fallen trees, understory, forest litter and the soil. Colorado — as well as Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Montana and Arizona — had “flipped over from a solution to actually part of the problem” at various intervals since 1990. Idaho and New Mexico were the only states to remain carbon sinks.\“We’ve taken it for granted that our forests are capturing and offsetting greenhouse gases from other sources in the rest of the economy,” he said.\During a wildfire, the combustion of trees is an immediate carbon source, one that residents far and near can see and sometimes feel in the air. Historically, the regrowth of the forest compensates for this source in the long term. But, as Chambers’ research and that of others show, regeneration in high-severity burn areas after vast wildfires is tough, especially in a water-sparse state like Colorado.\Then, there are the bugs. The bark beetle population swelled radically in Colorado in 2018, especially in the southwest corner. Spruce beetle attacked 178,000 acres of Engelmann spruce. Although that’s fewer than the 260,000 acres in 2017 and the 250,000 in 2016, about one-third of the acres chewed up last year were in previously unaffected areas. The roundheaded pine beetle in southwest Colorado more than doubled its presence to 27,000 acres, up from 11,000 acres in 2017, mostly in Dolores County.\Largely to blame were the state’s second-worst drought in 124 years and record-breaking heat, said Dan West, an entomologist with the Colorado State Forest Service.\“It doesn’t mean forest managers are doing a bad job; it just means that bugs and fire and drought are doing a good job,” Cleaves said.\Last year, 502 wildfires ran across more than 475,000 acres in Colorado. The state government and Forest Service spent $40.1 million and $120.3 million, respectively, on suppression. For the Forest Service, that’s nearly three times more than the $42 million it doled out for wildfire suppression during the 2017 fire season in Colorado.\The blazes emptied more than just the government’s wallet. Near Durango, the 416 fire ravaged the local summer recreation economy. In La Veta, the Spring Creek fire obliterated more than 200 structures and swept across 108,000 acres, making it the third-largest wildfire in Colorado history.\And fire could get worse.\By the middle of the century, the annual acreage burned in the West could expand by two to six times, according to an analysis in the federal government’s 2018 Fourth National Climate Assessment. Estimates made in 2017 show that about 2.9 million Coloradans are in the line of fire.\The length of the fire season — which some have now dubbed the “fire year” — increased 18.7 percent between 1979 and 2013, an article published in 2015 in Nature Communications shows. The study also found that terrestrial carbon uptake was lower during years with longer-than-average fire weather seasons.\More volatile snowpack, alongside drought and heat, will also amplify wildfire frequency and intensity, said Mike Lester, director of the state’s Forest Service. Though Colorado’s snowpack was 126 percent of median by mid-April this year, the snowpack was a mere 68 percent of median by April 1, 2018. It was one of seven years since 2000 that the snowpack peaked notably below average, compared with only one year between 1984 and 1999, federal snowpack data shows.\“If the snowpack doesn’t stay into the spring and early summer, the fire season is longer, and weather events and drought are also more extreme,” he said. “That’s the way it’s going to be, so we’re trying to get out in front of people to try to tell them how important the forest is.\“I have no ability to make climate go back to normal,” Lester said. “But I can make the forest healthy as a contribution to (climate change mitigation).”\Deep in the mountains just northeast of Pagosa Springs, Mike Battaglia may have a piece of the solution to forest health in a changing climate in Colorado. There, the research forester has mapped about 500 acres between 7,000 and 8,000 feet elevation of a thick conglomerate of ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, white fir, aspen and shrubby Gambel oak.\In his eyes, each tree and each species are an opportunity.\He could haul away the drought and fire susceptible white firs; group the ponderosa pines in small, spaced out clusters that mimic how they may have been paired 200 years ago; and, eventually, ignite prescribed fires that torch some trees but nourish others.\This plot is his laboratory, one where he and his colleagues will manipulate the physical makeup of the landscape as it cycles through wildfire, beetles, drought, record low and high snowfall and other natural events during the next 20-plus years. The goal: create a forest that is resistant to change, resilient to disturbances and prepared to transition to the unknown future climate.\“My job is to maximize multiple use and get the ecosystem processes back while still producing timber, and also providing for wildlife habitat, watershed health, understory plants and other parts of the environment,” said Battaglia, who hopes to start treatments this summer. “That’s why I went into this field. I want to do the right thing and make sure everyone does the right thing for the forest.”\Battaglia is not alone in his quest for restored forest equilibrium, either. His project is one of five experiments across the country that are exploring how humans can manufacture more robust forests in Georgia, Minnesota, Montana and New Hampshire.\“With forest management, we need to work with what we have and anticipate what it might be in 50 years,” said Linda Nagle, who leads the national project and is a forestry professor at Colorado State University. “And that’s different than 50 years ago when we didn’t think conditions would change. … This change is so rapid, too.”\“If we aren’t proactive to anticipate those changes quickly, we may lose the values in the forest that we’ve taken for granted for so long,” she said.\Colorado’s proactivity may be restricted compared with the others that forest managers are working to restore because of an emaciated timber market. Between 1982 and 2012 the number of sawmills producing lumber in the state declined from 84 to 31, the Forest Service found. Fewer broad feet can be processed in-state, and the wood that stays within Colorado’s borders often has to travel farther once it’s chopped down.\With no market, the transport costs — and the emissions released during the haul — exceed the payoff for the product and disincentivize contractors from signing onto the project.\“The biggest cost to that now is that we don’t have the infrastructure and, where we do, it’s too far away,” Battaglia said.\But, in Minnesota, where the timber market is thriving, the San Juan site’s sister project has so far generated about $1 million in wood byproduct sales, Nagle said. Just another thread to weave into the story of restoring forest health in Colorado.\“It’s really complex here,” Nagle said. “The solution isn’t simple.”\Someday, the Colorado wilderness may not resemble the thick belts of trees in peoples’ backyards across the Western Slope and Front Range, she said. Maybe they will have metamorphosed into a hillside of shrubs like the areas of the Hayman burn scar. Maybe they’ll even contain species not native to Colorado but more adapted to this new environment.\That reality forces us to re-imagine what our environment can and should look like.\As Marin Chambers put it, “There are a lot of interesting ecological impacts of the change from forested landscape to a prolonged nonforest landscape or an ecotype conversion. But I have a lot of questions to put back on the public. What do (they) want and desire and need out of these landscapes?”\Those questions invite the public to be proactive in a challenge that is of global scale with hyperlocal implications.\The answers will determine the future of our forests and whether, when Battaglia is retired walking through the woods, he can still find that sweet smell of butterscotch wafting from the ponderosa pines that he has come to love so much.\Twitter: @lizmforster Phone: 636-0193"

Congressman Jared Polis has written eloquently in the local press and to his constituents expressing his desire to reign in the oil and gas industry, eliminate government subsidies and tax breaks, and clean up air pollution. Mr. Polis also says he wants to promote renewable energy and green jobs. He even supports a carbon tax.
\
With those hopeful thoughts in mind, Mr. Polis should consider the upcoming congressional vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP will make it easier for more corporations to extract natural resources, including oil and gas, export jobs to cheap labor markets, move products and money around the planet, all the while protecting the profits of giant multinational corporations, banks and hedge funds.
\
A system of unaccountable international tribunals will enforce the agreement by enabling corporations to sue countries when government policies protecting people and the environment cut into corporate profits. When countries lose taxpayers are forced to pay millions or billions in compensation to the victorious corporations.
\
TPP will more than double the number of corporations able to sue for damages based on U.S. policies to limit fracking, promote local green jobs, clean up pollution and reduce carbon emissions, which will feel the chilling effect of real and threatened corporate retaliation A close reading of the text makes it clear that TPP environmental protections are effectively unenforceable.
\
Congressman Polis claims to be ""undecided"" about the TPP. However, he consistently touts its alleged benefits and downplays its considerable costs. He needs to hear from you.
\
Mr. Polis can't have it both ways. If he really wants clean air, green energy, jobs and action on climate change, then he must vote ""No"" on the TPP. Call Jared at 303-484-9596. Tell him we need a ""fair"" trade agreement that protects people and the environment rather than corporate profits.

""One of our most urgent projects is to develop a national energy policy. The United States is the only major industrial country without a comprehensive, long-range energy policy. Our program will emphasize conservation ... solar energy and other renewable energy sources.... we must face the fact that the energy shortage is permanent. There is no way we can solve it quickly. But if we all cooperate and make modest sacrifices ... we can find ways to adjust.""
\
Imagine those words spoken by the next president shortly after taking office on Jan. 20, 2009, continuing a theme originally established on the campaign trail. The words seem to be aimed directly at Westerners: ""If we wait, and do not act, then ... we will feel mounting pressure to plunder the environment. We will have a crash program to build more nuclear plants, strip-mine and burn more coal, and drill more (oil and gas) wells.... Intense competition will build up among ... the different regions within our own country.""
\
The president concludes: ""If you will join me so that we can work together with patriotism and courage, we will again prove that our great nation can lead the world into an age of peace, independence and freedom.
\
""This difficult effort will be the moral equivalent of war except that we will be uniting our efforts to build and not destroy.""
\
Inspiring and timely, indeed. But doesn't it sound kind of familiar? It should. The president who made those speeches did so 30 years ago. His name was Jimmy Carter.
\
When Carter tried to rally the nation during the first energy crisis, he understood that the West would be the key region in the effort. His policies weren't perfect - he pushed oil shale, for instance - but at least he had an overarching vision. It's been a long time since a president, or even a major presidential candidate, spoke so directly to our region and our fundamental issues.
\
Today, amid another energy crisis - with prices soaring, another rush to squeeze out the West's fossil fuels, and military ventures overseas related to our hunger for oil - we need a president who can address the issue in an inspiring and substantial manner. We need a leader to blaze a path toward real and lasting progress on energy.
\
So far in this election cycle, we have no such presidential candidate. Even in their much-ballyhooed debates in Nevada and California - where they were supposed to discuss Western issues - the candidates talked mostly of generic issues like Iraq and health insurance. Their debates and speeches are as relevant to New Jersey as to New Mexico - probably more so. Even the Western candidates in the race, such as Arizona Sen. John McCain, speak more to a national audience than to Westerners.
\
They need to change their tune. Though candidates have been able to ignore the West in the past, it's high time to take us seriously. Every year, the West's burgeoning population means more votes; every year, the region becomes more diverse, independent and politically mature. The old political patterns are breaking down; we're no longer just a Republican stronghold in the interior with Democratic bastions on the coasts. We've become a political battlefield, and that means well have a much greater voice in choosing the next president.
\
Western voters will respond to those candidates who understand that we have our own concerns and unique issues that need to be addressed by the next president.
\
Since no actual candidate has done so, High Country News has written the kind of campaign speech that we, as Westerners, would like to hear. It doesn't cover all the issues that the region cares about - no single speech could do that. Instead, like Carter's speech, it focuses on the one issue that has the most impact on our economies, cultures, communities and landscapes. A talented speechwriter might add a few jokes or anecdotes, perhaps insert a folksy Western twang, but this speech concentrates on the important points.
\
And it would work pretty well across the board in the West, from meetings of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association or the Sierra Club to the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce.
\
""Thank you, Westerners, for Showing Up. I address you as Westerners because you're part of a community that stretches from the Dakotas to New Mexico and west tO the Pacific. Your community has many divisions and conflicts, but you're unified by distinctive regional traits.
\
""You have the greatest open spaces, the most majestic scenery and wildlife, almost all the federal public lands and most of the tribal lands. You've come to expect that your water, air and land will be cleaner than in the rest of the nation. You also have the fastest pace of development consuming your landscape. You're the newest region of the U.S., so you're still forming your identity. You attract and favor entrepreneurs, and many of you are either finding new ways to make a living on the land or modifying the traditional ways to remain viable. There might be a mythical streak to it, but you still think of yourselves as living on a frontier.
\
""I've gained an understanding of the West by walking the ground and speaking with people like yourselves. I've watched salmon leaping up the fish ladders on the Columbia River dams. I've been with the crew on a Wyoming natural gas drill rig, on the night shift during a blizzard. I've stood on the front lines of the war against the monstrous wildfires. I've hiked through the ancient pueblos of Chaco Canyon in New Mexico, where a previous Western community once grew, then hit its limits and moved on.
\
""Today's Westerners face a slew of issues, including drought, population growth and immigration. But there is one challenge facing the West above all: energy development. That issue drives pretty much everything. A few basics sum it up: Of all the 50 states, Wyoming is now number one in the production of fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil. New Mexico, Colorado, California, Montana and Utah rank in the top 13. Your power plants burn the fuels to generate the electricity that powers the Western grid. Or you ship your gas or coal by pipeline or train to the Midwest and East, where it heats homes and powers televisions and computers.
\
""The dams on your rivers make your region the leader in hydropower. Washington, California and Oregon are the top three states; Idaho ranks fifth, Montana sixth and Arizona ninth in hydropower.
\
""For more than a century, these resources have been developed here, making your region the Old Energy Frontier.
\
""However, your West also leads the nation in the potential to generate renewable energy from the wind. You're the leader for potential solar energy and in the capacity to generate electricity from geothermal formations. You're even the top region for the potential to harness the energy from ocean waves. And you have significant potential to generate energy from biomass - from forest thinnings, dairy manure and crops.
\
""So you are blessed and you are cursed. You have Old Energy - with all its benefits and drawbacks. And you're poised to lead the nation and the world through a historic transition by blazing a different energy path. This will mean some hardships, but ultimately it will bring progress, new jobs and greater prosperity. If, together, we take the right steps, the West will become the world's New Energy Frontier.
\
""Throughout the 30 years since the last energy crisis, our national leaders and corporations have been partying on fossil fuels. The nation's appetite for energy keeps rising, and now that ravenous appetite is being strangled by a shortage of fuels. Prices are spiking, and many experts believe we're nearing the end of an era - we're not likely to discover enough feasible new supplies. It's way past midnight at the fossil fuel party, folks, and that inspires desperate actions that Westerners feel most of all.
\
""For the last seven years, the current president, with his background in the oil industry, has had his hand on the fossil fuel throttle. He's pushed drilling and mining above all other uses of public lands and resources in the West. True, this has brought paychecks and jobs. But those benefits are short-lived and not sustainable in the long term. Meanwhile, you Westerners have watched your land get torn up, the wildlife chased away, the air and water sullied. Despite attempts to extract fossil fuels responsibly, the results often end up looking like vandalism, violating Western qualities and values.
\
""And in the biggest threat of all, the carbon emissions - from the Old Energy power plants and the leaky wells and pipelines and the vehicles that burn those fuels - cause global warming and climate changes that will challenge generations to come.
\
""The current president has told the West what he wants to do: Extract the remaining fossil fuels to the point of exhaustion, and ramp up uranium mining, and build a big nuclear waste dump to encourage new nuclear power plants. Is that all you want? I don't think so.
\
""As your next president, I'll help you find the way to fulfill your potential as the New Energy Frontier.
\
""This year, the wind, sunlight, geothermal rocks and ocean waves will generate less than 2 percent of the electricity used in the U.S. Federal researchers - some of the world's top experts - say that if we get into gear, we can multiply our New Energy production by 10 times in the next couple of decades. It's even reasonable to generate half the nation's electricity with New Energy by 2030, they say. This electricity can power vehicles, homes and workplaces.
\
""The New Energy industries have greatly improved their technologies since their birth in the last energy crisis. The price of their electricity has plunged; they are more competitive with fossil fuels, and they have far fewer environmental impacts. They still have weaknesses - mainly the intermittency of wind and solar rays - but technologies and strategies are emerging to solve those.
\
""While the federal government has stalled, Westerners, through the recent actions of your governors, legislatures and voters, have moved forward. Many Western states, and the Western Governors' Association, have adopted policies to require utilities to buy more electricity from New Energy projects. Private investment money, much of it from California's software industry, is pouring into New Energy companies in the West.
\
""Companies based in Europe and other places where New Energy is more established are proposing new projects in the West. There's a surge in wind, solar and geothermal projects. Biofuel refineries are popping up amid Colorado farmland, and it won't be long before your coastal waves are generating power. It's an exciting time.
\
""Yet the entrepreneurs struggle to compete with the Old Energy interests, largely because Old Energy has more backing from the federal government. As president, I'll change that. I'll roll back economic policies and infrastructure that favor Old Energy. I'll allow New Energy to compete fairly.
\
As a first priority, I'll lead Congress to adopt a system for realistic pricing of electricity from fossil fuel plants. That means a carbon tax or a 'cap and trade' permitting system to bill companies for at least a fraction of their global warming impacts. That would raise the cost of Old Energy and make the New Energy more attractive in the marketplace.
\
""Then, I'll make the tax policies and subsidies fairer. The federal government currently provides $50 billion to $100 billion each year in tax breaks, other incentives and subsidies for energy development. Sixty-five percent of that goes to fossil fuels and nuclear power gets 12 percent. Wind, solar and geothermal combined get a measly 8 percent. I'll change that math.
\
""Some of the key incentives are federal tax credits for developers of wind, solar and geothermal projects. At various times since they were initiated during the last energy crisis, some of those tax credits have expired or been reduced; some have since been revived or increased. This roller-coaster has created uncertainty - investors and companies often don't know what the tax situation will be in two years, so they can't make solid plans for long-term projects. Those tax credits will expire at the end of this year, unless Congress acts. I'll work with Congress to extend the credits for six to eight years in order to give the entrepreneurs some stability.
\
""As president, I'll also do more to provide federal loan guarantees for New Energy projects, which will encourage conservative bankers to finance new projects. The government already offers guarantees for energy projects; the only taxpayer cost comes if projects fail. That's a diminishing risk these days, with the advances in New Energy technology. But the loan guarantee program now favors nuclear and coal over renewables. We need to do a lot more with loan guarantees for renewables. It's a strategy that's proven effective.
\
""I'll also encourage discoveries - the equivalent of the Lewis and Clark Expedition - by increasing federal investment in energy research. The government is now spending only one-third of what we did each year during the last energy crisis. Researchers say we're on the verge of important breakthroughs in storing wind and solar energy. Engineers have already learned how to store solar energy in molten salts, making power from the sun available up to 18 hours every day. Some say they're close to developing a way to spray photovoltaic films onto panels, which would make solar power a lot cheaper. The West already has research centers in the National Renewable Energy Lab near Denver and the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, and in the entrepreneurial companies now springing up in the region. In the future, the West will export both energy and discoveries made in its labs.
\
""Some of the biggest moves I'll make on the New Energy Frontier have to do with the grid of electricity transmission lines. We need to build new lines into the isolated areas where our wind and solar resources are most concentrated. I'll do more to push agencies such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Energy and the Bureau of Land Management to site transmission lines to facilitate New Energy development.
\
""I'll use two gigantic federal tools in the West - the Bonneville Power Administration, which runs hydropower dams on the Columbia River system, and the Western Area Power Administration, which runs more than 50 dams on the Colorado River system and other rivers. Those federal agencies own big transmission lines - the power backbones of the West. They could build new lines aimed at wind and solar and geothermal areas. That would make it easier to hook up. Costs could be subsidized, or fronted and then recovered from New Energy companies as they hook up.
\
""The more New Energy projects we have connected to the grid across the region, the more reliable New Energy becomes.
\
""I'll also put more effort into figuring out how to use the federal dams - the cheapest constant source of electricity - to 'firm up' the intermittencies of wind and solar power. When wind or solar cuts out temporarily, hydropower could be used as a backup. It wouldn't be easy, because much of that hydropower is already committed to other demands, but researchers are already studying how to do it. A lot of people are pioneering thinkers on the New Energy Frontier.
\
""I'll also push efficiency and conservation. The Department of Energy must continue to toughen the efficiency standards for appliances, for instance. There was almost no progress on that front during the current administration until Congress passed new standards in the 2007 Energy Bill. Still, there's room for progress. More than 50 million homes still have gas-fired hot-water heaters that waste half the energy that goes into them, even though companies are already making far more efficient - and affordable - hot-water heaters.
\
""But as important as conservation is, it's not enough on its own. We need to develop our New Energy resources. We can't just conserve our way out of this crisis.
\
New Energy will have impacts and costs. Expanding the grid will cost more than $1 million per mile. Some public land will be crossed with new lines. Wind projects can take a toll on birds and bats. Solar projects have to cover a noticeable amount of land for each megawatt. Some environmentalists will oppose almost any proposal, and some neighbors will inevitably say 'not in my backyard.'
\
""Critics will argue that the shift toward New Energy will mean higher electricity rates for a while. Some Old Energy jobs will disappear.
\
""But this frontier will also create new jobs and new income streams. A solar power plant or a field of wind turbines can provide just as many jobs for each megawatt as a smoke-spewing power plant. We'll also have new manufacturing jobs for solar and wind equipment - those kinds of manufacturers are taking root in the West as we speak. The equipment prices will drop, and the power will become even more affordable.
\
""Many believe, and I share the belief, that New Energy will be the cheapest energy in the future, even if we don't count the environmental benefits. And because much of the New Energy frontier lies in rural areas, including Indian reservations, where wind and solar potential is high, it will give us a chance to address poverty and stimulate neglected economies.
\
""We won't abandon those who make their living in Old Energy - the coal mines and gas drills will continue running far into the future. But even those companies are already branching out into New Energy, because they're energy companies and they'll take that dedication wherever it may be useful. And who knows, scientists may come up with an effective way to sequester carbon in the West's geologic formations, so Old Energy can be used in a responsible manner.
\
""We can work together on this. Let's help farmers and ranchers stave off subdivisions by helping them do New Energy developments. Let's take action on global warming, and reduce Western wildfires and drought. Let's slow the oil and gas rush. Let's heal the wounds in the federal agencies, by freeing them from the corruption so often found under Old Energy.
\
""Add New Energy projects to the farm bill, for better rural diversification. Add New Energy projects to private land conservation deals. Add New Energy projects to mining law reform, because mined land is already disturbed. Generate power with the methane vented from coal mines rather than just put it into the air.
\
""Together we can preserve the West's values and lead the nation and the world on a better, cleaner path. Join me, Westerners, on the new frontier.

Recently one of my colleagues sent me a story that sums-up the media's apathetic appetite for covering the environment. It is perplexing and disturbing.
\
The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment, despite the rhetoric from every GOP candidate.
\
Climate change dropped further from the world headlines in 2011 compared to the previous year even though a one-in-100-year drought in Texas has entered its second year; 70 percent of Mexico is enveloped by its worst drought in 70 years; Australia faced epic flooding costing taxpayers in excess of $5 billion in infrastructure costs; and plants are so confused in their bio-rhythmic cycles that the white petals of snow drops, normally a spring flower, are now unfurling in the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C.

Clearly, nature is showing climatologists, ecologists, physiologists and oceanographers that the web of life is being brutally dismantled by rising greenhouse gases. Humans are exceptional problem solvers, so why has the media chosen not to focus on positive solutions? After all, Americans have the highest concentration of brainpower in our colleges compared to any other nation on the globe.
\
For those that do not believe that anything is going on -- walk, ride or fly anywhere across western North America and you'll see vast amounts of dead trees. In the past 40 years across the West temperatures have risen, on average in excess of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Although this number appears to be small it has effectively removed nature's ecological cold curtain enabling mountain pine beetles an opportunity to speed up their life cycle, invade and decimate high elevation pine forests across the continent.
\
Instead of absorbing CO2, billions of beetle-killed trees across the West are decaying and stoking the ever-rising pool of greenhouse gases.
\
Death rates of whitebark and limber pines across the Western U.S. are as high as 90 percent -- the sentinels of the high country -- have become the tsunami sirens of global warming, showing scientists that a warming world is irrevocably altering the landscape across the entire mountainous region of western North America.
\
It's not just the forests that are disappearing but rather immense amounts of ice that reflect incoming solar radiation. One hundred billion tons of ice melted from Greenland during the blistering-warm summer of 2010. This year alone 50 percent of Canada's millennia-old Arctic ice shelves along the coast of Elsmere Island vanished.
\
And far worse, the Southern Ocean which occupies 22 percent of the total ocean on the globe, absorbing 40 percent of Earth's CO2 is acidifying so quickly (as a byproduct of absorbing rising CO2) that by 2030 the sea water will be corrosive to crustaceans, dissolving shells that the animals are making. This amplification will reverberate all the way up the food chain to the whales.
\
Data from the Global Carbon Project showed the carbon emissions from our planet had increased 5.9 percent between 2009-2010; that's the largest jump in any year since the Industrial Revolution.
\
The $17 trillion Albertan oil sands must spend carbon energy and precious fresh water to separate the gooey, toxic oil from the sand. Moreover by burning this petroleum humans will knowingly raise atmospheric CO2 levels by an astounding 150 ppm. Earth will be uninhabitable for life as we know it.
\
If Australia with its $10 trillion coke-coal industry can ratify a carbon tax then surely we in America can set a low-carbon standard that China and India will follow.
\
We are running out of time to combat rising CO2 emissions: Earth's forests are dying.

80," BOULDER - The General Assembly, which passed two dozen bills aimed at protecting the environment and increasing renewable energy this session, is far from done with the subject, legislative leaders told a crowd Monday.\ A California-style law that would require greater efficiency in new cars should pass next year ""without too much problem,"" said Rep. Jack Pommer, D-Boulder. And issues like credits for renewable energy and fighting proposed oilshale development on the Western Slope also are likely to be priorities, he and other officials said.\ In addition, some of the measures passed into law this year are likely to find their way into a bill coming before Congress that deals with the nation's energy portfolio, said Rep. Mark Udall, an Eldorado Springs Democrat. Those include grants and incentives to boost the number of vehicles that run on ethanol-heavy E-85 fuel and to increase the number of E-85 stations.\ ""2007 really marked a clear demarcation in time in this state,"" said House Majority Leader Alice Madden, D-Boulder. ""We're creating new rules that welcome the growth markets of tomorrow.""\ The statements came at a public forum put on by the Energy and Environmental Security Initiative, a University of Colorado Law School center dedicated to finding renewable energy solutions. In addition to the elected officials, speakers included Governor's Energy Office Director Tom Plant and the executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Jim Martin.\ Gov. Bill Ritter campaigned on a platform of what he has termed the ""New Energy Economy,"" and the first-year Democrat successfully pushed through a wide range of renewable energy bills, some with bipartisan support. Those included measures to double the mandate for renewable energy use and to speed the building of wind-power transmission lines.\ The next measures may stir more debate.\ A bill similar to laws passed in 12 other states that would require new vehicles to meet higher fuel-efficiency standards is very likely to hit the floor in 2008. A number of Republicans have warned that such a law would drive up the price of cars without significant environmental gains.\ Madden and Pommer said they expect to see a clean-cars bill come up.\ ""Last year we had so much going on that we thought it was something that we could put off,"" said Pommer, a member of the powerful Joint Budget Committee. ""I think it will pass without too much problem.""\ Pommer said Democrats also will offer a bill allowing people to get credit with utilities when they make their own wind or solar energy and may wade into what has been a primarily federal debate about the feasibility of oil shale extraction in Colorado.\ Martin added the administration is looking for feedback on what kind of climate-control measures Coloradans want, and he plans to give a blueprint to Ritter before the end of the year.\ Several people in the roughly 200-person audience that included many longtime environmental activists expressed support for a carbon tax, which would be charged to drivers or power-plant operators based on the coal and gas they burn. Madden said such an idea would be a difficult sell with voters who eschew tax hikes and isn't likely to pass ""within the next six years.""\ ""A lot of talk today felt like we have this huge boulder coming at us and we're using a BB gun to shoot at it,"" said Chaz Teplin, a scientist as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden. He added, though, that he understands the need to temper action with political caution.\ CONTACT THE WRITER: (303) 837-0613 or ed.sealover@gazette.com"

""This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate,"" by Naomi Klein, is probably the most important book ever written about our environment. It truthfully portrays the grim climate crisis we collectively face, a crisis which could threaten the continuation of human life on this planet. It also confronts, with unrelenting honesty, the daunting social revolution necessary to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. ""This Changes Everything"" is prodigiously researched, comprehensive in scope, eloquently written, and -- notwithstanding its ominous subject -- fundamentally hopeful. Klein artfully combines up-to-date scientific information and astute political analysis with sometimes painful personal experience.
\
The book has four main messages. First: climate change is real, caused by human activities, and globally devastating in its potential impact. Second: growth-oriented, deregulated, privatizing, neoliberal capitalism cannot prevent calamitous climate change. Third: the situation is not impossible. If we can endure a massive social transformation and generate a global mobilization like that in World War II, our world can escape the worst consequences of climate change. Fourth: a successful effort to mitigate climate change can vastly improve human society. The emerging societies would be more egalitarian, cooperative, unified, and sustainable.
\
The author attributes denial of climate change not mainly to ignorance, but to accurate assessment of the massive social transformation needed to address the problem realistically (i.e. solution aversion). Conservatives often have a more credible appraisal of the necessary changes than do liberals who may rest content with grossly inadequate programs such as recycling.
\
Klein is highly critical of organizations she refers to as ""Big Green."" These are the well-funded traditional environmental associations such as Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund, and National Resource Defense Council that endorse the capitalist establishment. Instead of fighting the corporations responsible for soaring carbon emissions, Big Green has effectively merged with them. Many receive funding from Shell, BP, Walmart, Monsanto, and the like. Big Green has championed natural gas and fracking as an alternative to coal while minimizing methane emissions and other problems associated with hydraulic fracturing.
\
Klein draws hope and inspiration from ""Blockadia."" This is the rapidly growing international grassroots movement opposing destructive extraction of resources from the earth. Growth-oriented capitalism inevitably creates ""sacrifice zones,"" territories largely poisoned in the name of progress. Blockadia movements first arose within these sacrifice zones. Klein portrays many such movements including those from a Romanian farming community, herders of Inner Mongolia, First Nation communities in Canada, the forests of New South Wales (Australia), the Ogoni people in the Niger Delta of Nigeria, and the ""Cowboy and Indian alliance"" combating the Keystone XL pipeline in western USA.
\
How should humanity cope with the global climate crisis? ""This Changes Everything"" implies an approach based upon three overlapping stages. The first stage involves a vast extension of Blockadia. We must build worldwide social movements, with grassroots leadership, determined to resist the destruction of our collective environment. Without such movements, our situation is truly hopeless. ""Only mass movements can save us,"" says Klein in her concluding chapter.
\
The second stage, premised on the success of the first, emphasizes environmental policy. This stage would include: (a) implementation of the principle that ""polluters pay"" through a substantial carbon tax and related measures; (b) increased taxation of the rich funding a complete transition to renewable energy in 40 years or less; (c) creation of a comprehensive social safety net with guaranteed minimal income for everyone; (d) locally-controlled public energy systems (Klein discusses the Boulder initiative, pp. 98-99); and (e) greatly expanded public transportation with local production of food and other commodities.
\
The third stage in the effort to cope with the climate crisis underscores institutional change. Here the emphasis is on reconstructing democracy; redistributing wealth both nationally and globally; environmentally-oriented economic planning for a no-growth economy; rebuilding community life and the public sphere; and changing cultural values in favor of interdependence rather than individualism and cooperation rather than hierarchy. Can these profound institutional changes happen within a capitalist system of any sort? I am extremely doubtful.
\
This book reminds me of a statement made by the famous psychiatrist Robert Lifton about nuclear weapons: ""The degree of numbing of everyday life necessary for individual comfort is at odds with the degree of tension, or even anxiety that must accompany the awareness necessary for collective survival."" If you can tolerate the anxiety associated with knowing the truth about climate change, and if you are determined to do something real for collective survival, then ""This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate"" is a must read.

83,"
Two days before Halloween, Kurt Waltzer appeared before the House subcommittees on Energy and the Environment and said something bizarre. Waltzer, managing director of the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit focused on combating climate change, told the congressmen that oil extraction, if done with a certain technique, could help the United States reduce carbon dioxide emissions - even if the nation keeps burning coal.
\
More surprisingly, a number of environmental groups share Waltzer's enthusiasm for ""enhanced oil recovery,"" or EOR. The process works by pumping carbon dioxide into aging oil wells to help retrieve stranded pockets of crude. The greenhouse gas stays in the ground. Oil companies have practiced EOR for decades in places like the Permian Basin, on the Texas-New Mexico border. But only recently have environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and Center for Climate and Energy Solutions taken an interest in it. ""It's a win-winwin,"" says Patrick Falwell, a fellow at the center. 'You're expanding domestic energy production, advancing carbon capture and sequestration, contributing to economic growth, and also reducing carbon dioxide emissions."" (Actually, that's four wins.)
\
But serious concerns remain about the environmental costs of burning all that crude - and about whether the C02 will stay put. As climate activist Bill McKibben put it: ""Anything that helps recover more oil is a bad idea.""
\
Power plants are the United States' most prolific producers of carbon dioxide contributing 40 percent of our emissions. The Obama administration wants to reduce that number to fight climate change. In September, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released draft rules that would cap C02 emissions from new power plants. If those rules become law, new coal plants could be built only if they capture and safely store carbon emissions.
\
Unfortunately, so-called carbon capture and sequestration technology is currently prohibitively expensive. The EPA says it probably won't require existing power plants to install it, and most proposed plants that plan to use it are subsidized by the Department of Energy. Still, there are successful examples: The Great Plains Synfuels Plant in North Dakota captures about half of its carbon emissions, and ExxonMobil's LaBarge, Wyo., natural gas processing plant traps 4 million metric tons of the stuff each year. BY EMILY GUERIN
\
Both plants sell the carbon for enhanced oil recovery.
\
There is a huge demand for C02 in the oil industry. Historically, oil companies in the Permian Basin have tapped natural underground deposits of C02 in Colorado and New Mexico and piped the pressurized gas hundreds of miles to the oilfields. There, it's injected underground, where it pushes the stranded oil towards producing wells. But for several years, C02 demand has outpaced supply. This shortage is considered the single largest obstacle to expanding enhanced oil recovery in the basin.
\
Dave Hawkins, the Natural Resources Defense Council's director of climate programs, would like to use carbon captured from power plants to meet that demand, instead of ""doing that rather idiotic thing of pulling C02 out of the ground and pipelining it and sticking it back in."" The Department of Energy estimates that EOR could permanently store the C02 emissions from 93 large coal-fired power plants operated for 30 years.
\
Before depleted oilfields can be safely transformed into C02 sinks, however, Hawkins and others say the EPA must increase its oversight to ensure the pressurized C02 doesn't cause earthquakes or leak out, which is likely what happened in a Wyoming oilfield last fall, when six dead ducks were found floating in a creek bubbling with C02. ""If you want to claim the carbon benefit of sequestration,"" says NRDC scientist George Peridas, ""then I think we should set the bar higher.""
\
The issue of ""carbon benefit"" is where EOR gets controversial. To be a meaningfid storage solution, says ClimateProgress editor Joe Romm, EOR would need to be used to bury massive amounts of C02, which would also require extracting ""a staggering amount of oil."" Indeed, a 2009 EOR study estimates that every metric ton of C02 injected underground produces oil that, when burned, emits between 3.7 and 4.7 metric tons of C02. Other estimates are lower, but the amount emitted still exceeds the amount stored.
\
""Does it produce more oil out of the ground?"" Waltzer asks. 'Yeah, it does."" Still, if EOR helps bring about the widespread adoption of carbon capture technology, ultimately resulting in a net decrease of emissions, he's OK with burning more oil in the short term. 'You're paying a little bit now to get a big payoff later.""
\
Besides, EOR is the only real market for C02, and the only cost-effective way to sequester it, says energy consultant Velio Kuuskraa. Although storing carbon without producing oil is better from a climate perspective, Kuuskraa says, it's unrealistic without a hefty carbon tax. ""There's no economic value. It's waste disposal."" Plus, 'You still have to import that barrel of oil from the Middle East.""
\
The possibility of substituting domestic for imported oil, and extending the life of existing oilfields rather than drilling new ones, is another reason some environmentalists support EOR. ""It is much better for the environment to have that oil come from oilfields that are already developed,"" says NRDC's Hawkins. ""EOR doesn't mean additional barrels of oil. It just helps those barrels of oil come from (better) places,"" with the added benefit that C02 is sequestered in the process.
\
Ultimately, Waltzer hopes EOR can lower the cost of carbon capture and advance sequestration technology, thereby opening the door to other forms of storage that don't involve oil drilling. ""If there was ever a chance for a big idea to succeed in our current political climate,"" he wrote last year, ""EOR is it."" ?

84,"On a gravel lot next to Radiological Imaging Technology's office building on List Drive, workers are placing the last of 683 solar panels onto steel frames. On a sunny day, the completed array will produce 147 kilowatts of electricity - the largest private solar-power system in the city.\For Dan Ritt, RIT's founder and president, the panels are a gamble, a billboard, a point of pride and an investment. That last point is comparatively new territory for solar power, long the province of hard-core environmentalists and far-flung homes off the electrical grid.\But rapidly falling prices for solar panels and equipment, coupled with generous subsidies from federal, state and local governments, are making solar power an intriguing option for businesses and homeowners looking to hedge their power costs.\""The return on investment for Phase 1 (the first 312 panels) was five years,"" Ritt said. ""You'd be hard-pressed to find another investment like that."" \Since the first panels went up in July 2009, RIT's typical electric bill of $700-$800 a month has all but vanished, Ritt said.\When he bought the land for his company's offices\three years ago, he planned to put up a two-story warehouse and office on the lot next to the main building.\Then a friend in Los Angeles told him about the booming demand for rooftop solar arrays in that city and it got Ritt thinking.\""If you think about (solar) as a business, it's a wonderful business,"" he said. ""There's no employees, there's no upkeep. All you have to do is pray for sunshine."" \Last year, John Hughes, president of O?Briens Carpet One on Garden of the Gods Road, was talking with his friend Craig Whitney, owner of Whitney Electric, about the falling prices and rebates available on solar.\""What it all boils down to,"" Whitney said, ""is it's a pretty good deal if the rebates are there."" \Hughes took the numbers to his accountant. ""He felt it was a no-brainer that we do this,"" Hughes said.\By December, 25,000 watts of solar panels sat on top of the 10,000-square-foot Carpet One building. The array cost a whopping $175,000, but Hughes received a $3.75 per watt ($93,750) rebate from Colorado Springs Utilities, plus a 30 percent federal tax credit and an accelerated depreciation schedule for the system.\""When it's all over and done with, it's going to be pretty low out-of-pocket,"" Hughes said. ""I think we should have, within a 3- to 5-year period, total return on investment."" \John Crandall, owner of the Old Town Bike Shop on South Tejon Street, was the first business owner to take advantage of Utilities? rebate program, back in 2007. A difficult installation drove up the project's costs to $59,000 for a 4,200-watt system, or $14 a watt. Even so, Crandall said he'd do it again today.\""Even in our worst case, a 20-year-payback, that's a 4 percent return on investment,"" he said. ""Even at that, it's one of the best places you can put your money."" \Take away the rebates and credits, however, and the economics of solar power get cloudy quickly.\The rebates spur investment in solar technology, which drives down prices and, eventually, makes further rebates unnecessary, said Mona Newton, central regional representative for the Governor's Energy Office.\""You have to stimulate the market, you have to bring the price more into parity with standard electricity,"" she said.\That strategy has had some success. A 2009 study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that installed costs of solar power have fallen by more than $3 a watt in the past 10 years, dropping from $10.80 per watt in 1998 to $7.50 per watt in 2008, before any rebates are taken into account. In Germany and Japan, which have very generous rebate programs, the average cost is less than $7 a watt, the study found.\At RIT, Ritt said the cost of solar panels fell 15 percent just since July 2009, when the first panels were installed, and March of this year, when the second set went in.\""I think early on, it was primarily people interested in the environmental or the political aspects of it,"" said Lotus (who goes by one name), president of Rocky Mountain Solar and Wind, which installed the RIT system. ""As time has gone on, they've been looking at the economics more because prices have come down so much."" \That's still, however, a long way from making solar as affordable as conventional power sources, particularly in Colorado, where much of our power comes from cheap coal. In Hawaii, solar power is already approaching ""grid parity? in price, and it can compete with peak demand pricing in parts of California.\Solar manufacturers say they'll have to hit $1 a watt to be broadly competitive with existing power sources. Several solar-power companies in Colorado are pursuing thin-film technology that, they say, can meet that price.\Dave Grossman, a spokesman for Colorado Springs Utilities, said conserving electricity through energy-efficient lighting, appliances and insulation is far cheaper than generating additional power through solar panels.\""More energy savings are achieved from efficiency rebates than from solar-energy installations,"" Grossman said. ""Efficiency upgrades are more affordable for customers, have a far better payback and can actually do more to protect the environment, dollar for dollar, than PV (photovoltaic) systems."" \Nevertheless, Colorado Springs Utilities has increased the size of its solar rebate program every year, from $170,000 in 2006 to $818,804 in 2009. (The program dipped to $672,100 in 2010, but Utilities is hoping to get another $300,000 from a state grant to add to the pool this year.)\Grossman said Utilities wants to support alternative-energy sources and meet its customers? interest in installing solar power while also supporting those less-flashy energy-efficiency programs. While the size of the pot has grown, Utilities? rebate per-watt for solar power has dropped every year as solar panels get cheaper, from $4 a watt in 2006 to $3 a watt in 2010.\Rebates have their detractors. Jon Caldara, president of the free-market Independence Institute in Golden, said rebates distort the market and waste money.\""I have nothing against feel-good, warm-and-fuzzy power as long as there is no subsidy for it,"" he said. ""You can call it the ""new energy economy,"" but really all it is is good old-fashioned political back scratching? corporate welfare with a happier face."" \A bill signed by Gov. Bill Ritter earlier this month requires that Xcel Energy and other producers generate 30?percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020 (CSU has to generate only 10 percent of its power from renewables by 2020), which will cause costs to soar, Caldara argues. ""Solar is outrageously expensive,"" he said. ""None of it is affordable without subsidies."" \Another way solar power could compete with coal and natural gas is if the government implemented a carbon cap aimed at reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, which is believed to contribute to global warming. A carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system, such as the U.S. Senate is considering, would drive up the price of fossil fuels and make carbon-neutral power sources like solar and wind look a lot better.\That's what Ritt is betting on to make the second phase of his array pay off. After using CSU's rebate in 2009, the second half of his array wasn't eligible for further rebates (although it's still eligible for the federal tax credit). Instead, Ritt struck a deal with CSU in which he gets to keep the renewable energy certificates generated by his solar panels. These certificates, or RECs, can be bought by companies needing to offset their carbon emissions. They aren't worth much at the moment, but a carbon cap could turn them into green gold.\""The way the world is going, I really think there's going to be carbon pricing,"" Ritt said. ""There's already a market (for RECs) in Europe."" \In the meantime, CSU pays Ritt and other solar owners a wholesale price (equal to half of the retail price) for any power they generate beyond their own use.\Nor do the benefits come solely on the utility bill. RIT's customers come from hospitals in 38 countries, Ritt said, and those customers like to see RIT's commitment to renewable energy.\""They're excited to see this and happy to see this,"" Ritt said. ""It really has helped us."" \Old Town Bike Shop's Crandall and O?Briens Carpet One's Hughes agreed that the panels are great billboards, attracting interest and customers.\It doesn't come with a price tag attached, but the final piece of the solar puzzle is that, for people who believe in the technology, installing a system makes them feel like they're doing their part to make the world a better place.\""Worst-case, I'm doing something incredible for the environment,"" Ritt said. ""We've all got to do our part. I feel fortunate I've been able to do something here."" \Call the writer at 636-0275.\Credit: ANDREW WINEKE awineke@gazette.com"
85,"Last month, for one day, we celebrated Earth Day. One day - that's it!\That's rather amazing when you think that everything we produce in our economy ultimately comes from the Earth. Last time I checked, we weren't getting natural resources from other planets.\Yet we continue to act as if the Earth's resources are unlimited, even during this recession when we've had to come face-to-face with the excesses of our past.\Take this idea of turning the recession around with ""green jobs."" Sure, green jobs are a step in the right direction.\But many would have us believe we only need to offer incentives for green jobs and -- poof -- we will have solved our environmental problems and the recession at the same time.\I'm all for greening the economy, but neither the rhetoric nor the money being spent to promote ""green jobs"" are going to fix our worst environmental problems.\These problems require real change in the way our economy and our world works.\For example, fossil fuel subsidies total around $300 billion globally. These work mainly to lower the prices of coal, electricity, natural gas and oil products relative to other types of energy. Yet these products have high environmental and health costs associated with their use -- costs that are not borne by those who are profiting from producing and selling these products. So there is little economic incentive to reduce their use.\One of the first things we can do is to end all subsidies that work to exacerbate global warming and other environmental problems. (That probably means doing away with subsidies for corn ethanol, too.) Then price the unpriced contribution of nature to our economy, e.g. a carbon tax. After all, nature is a scarce resource.\Sure, there will be some pain involved; some prices will rise, and some jobs will be eliminated. But jobs will be created -- greener jobs, and greener types of energy will get cheaper. In the long run, we will potentially save enormous costs as we reduce the consequences of global warming.\But we must also stabilize our population. Any gains that may come from better pricing of energy and other resources will all be wiped out with increased population, not to mention with increased consumption that comes as countries around the world continue to develop.\For example, even if miles per gallon for cars doubled because of better pricing of external costs, hundreds of millions more people will be buying and driving cars.\More cars require more tires, more engines, etc., and making these components uses resources, often in damaging ways. When cars are discarded, toxic chemicals and other junk pollute our environment. Add to that the gasoline still being used, and we're back to square one.\If we made some progress on just these two issues, next year's Earth Day could be a celebration of how far we've come, not a reminder of what we seem unwilling to do.\Linda Stanley, Ph.D., is a research scientist at Colorado State University.

86,"Earth's temperature hasn't increased significantly in 15 years, which wouldn't be big news except global warming extremists had predicted temperatures would soar during that time because of manmade greenhouse-gas emissions.\That forecast would be just another failed hypothesis, except governments around the world used threatened overheating as an excuse to regulate, tax and subsidize to curb greenhouse gases and, of course, save the Earth.\In 1989 the Miami Herald quoted a U.N. environment official who warned of a ""10-year window of opportunity to solve"" global warming, because ""entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.""\Great Britain's heretofore hotbed of global warming alarmism, East Anglia's Climate Research Center, says there has been no meaningful warming since 1997. Indeed, the Earth may be cooling, according to Britain's Meteorological Office. The Met, as it's called, said we are entering a period of slower solar activity, perhaps as severe as the solar slump from 1645-1715, the coldest part of the Little Ice Age, when Britain's river Thames and Holland's canals froze.\Warmists may have seen this coming. Five years ago, climate scientist Kevin Trenberth lamented that none of the touted computer models that predicted temperature increases ""correspond even remotely to the current observed climate."" If temperatures merely stay flat, the difference between real temperatures and what the global warming models predict ""will eventually become so great that the whole scientific community will question the current theories,"" said Duke University scientist Nicola Scafetta, whose specialty is theoretical and applied statistics.\We are beginning to see effects of the disasters that did not pan out. A British Parliament committee urged government to scrap a carbon tax that would drive up electricity prices with no environmental benefit. The Spanish government suspended subsidies for new renewable-energy power plants. Stocks tumbled for companies reliant on such handouts.\Is human-caused global warming a hoax? Vote in poll to the right. Must vote to see results.\The New York Times reported that ""wind and solar companies are telling Congress that they cannot be truly competitive and keep creating jobs without a few more years of government support,"" but there is ""little enthusiasm for alternative-energy subsidies in Washington.""\Two days after President Barack Obama's State of the Union message alluded to the firm Ener1 as a successful clean energy ""investment,"" the company filed bankruptcy, despite its $118 million Energy Department grant. It was the latest of several government-financed renewable energy companies in the mode of bankrupt solar-panel maker Solyndra.\Sixteen noteworthy scientists published a statement this week in the Wall Street Journal, assuring the public, ""there's no compelling scientific argument for drastic action to 'decarbonize' the world's economy.""\There's a long way to go to reverse taxes and regulations that for years have fed alternative energy industries at the expense of taxpayers, ratepayers and producers of cheap and plentiful energy. California, for example, just adopted the nation's most stringent vehicle emission regulation to achieve a 50-percent further reduction in greenhouse gases by 2025. It's time to stop the global-warming regulatory madness. - Freedom Communications, Inc."

The eco-crusader becomes, as a result, deaf to reason and science, blind to perspective and priorities, incapable of effective action.""\That's telling'em, Mr. President. Or it would have been, if Richard Nixon hadn't let staffers talk him out of giving the Eco-Crusader speech in September 1971.\Fired up by attacks on the ""disaster lobby"" by Look magazine publisher Thomas Shepard, and uneasy about his own role in establishing the Environmental Protection Agency after the first Earth Day in 1970, Nixon directed me and other speechwriters to produce a warning against ecological extremism that he could deliver as a major address.\Our draft died on his desk amid concerns about political backlash. I kept the file as a historical curiosity - the presidential bombshell that wasn't.\Today, four decades into the age of true-believing green religion, Nixon's undelivered speech reads prophetically.\So does Shepard's diagnosis that the environmental doomsayers ""are basically opposed to the free enterprise system and will do anything to bolster their case for additional government controls."" So does the denunciation by Prof. Peter Drucker, another source we consulted at the time, of the green fallacy ""that one can somehow deprive human action of risk."" The battle lines have changed little in 38 years.\I wish now that President Nixon, a gambler in foreign policy, had risked this piece of domestic truth-telling. One politically incorrect speech from the White House couldn't have halted the tides of earth-worshipping guilt and fear that still engulf us. But it would have been a start. With braver leadership, sooner, America's voices for environmental common sense might have been less outnumbered today.\Two of those lonely voices were in Colorado last week. Terry Anderson, head of the Montana-based Property & Environment Research Center, and Christopher Horner, a fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., brought a coolly factual message to deflate some of the new-energy hype and carbon-phobia that Bill Ritter trades on and Obama wants to emulate.\Anderson literally wrote the book on free-market environmentalism - a 1991 volume by that title. He told the Independence Institute about PERC's research on such inconvenient truths as the wildly oversold benefits of green jobs and the grim toll that cap-and-trade legislation to mitigate CO2 will take on our standard of living.\Horner's current book is ""Red Hot Lies: How Global Warming Alarmists Use Threats, Fraud, and Deception to Keep You Misinformed."" He told the Centennial Institute, where I work, that a recessionary economy and 10 straight years of global cooling make this the worst time for a burdensome new carbon tax that ""would not detectably impact climate anyway.""\If the eco-crusaders were serious about cleaner energy, says Horner, they would support nuclear power. They aren't, so they don't. And again, we find the battle lines unchanged; the nuclear debate also pervades my 1971 White House file.\No, their aim is control, as Thomas Shepard warned. ""For a new enemy to unite us, the threat of global warming fits the bill,"" gloated the anti-growth Club of Rome in 1991.\Cheerleading mainstream journalists have decided the likes of Horner and Anderson ""are not news,"" as one bluntly told me - so you heard little about their visit to Ritterville. The governor letting three eco-crusading foundations pay his climate czar's salary has caused no stir either. What sheep we are.\-\Andrews is a former president of the Colorado Senate and directs the Centennial Institute at Colorado Christian University.\Credit: JOHN ANDREWS; GUEST COLUMNIST"

Fossil-fuel divestiture by the University of Colorado is important for the future of our great school. I have taught courses on sustainable energy and the environment at the University of Colorado for over 30 years. For most of that time I have abstained from political activism at the university, preferring to let others, including some of my students, engage in the political process. But at this point in my life I do not want to stay on the sidelines any longer. Climate change and other adverse impacts from our extravagant use of fossil fuels impact our way of life. As an engineer and the former senior research fellow at the Solar Energy Research Institute, I believe that the evidence for global warming from anthropomorphic activity is unassailable. As a citizen I want to try and use this information to help steer our energy system towards a sustainable future.
\
Energy is the mainstay of a modern society and our university has both educational and research programs that describe the way human activities create climate change and global warming. As Spense Havlick said (""The greening of CU,"" Daily Camera, April 21), CU has also invested considerable effort in ""greening"" its business operations by recycling, procurements, reducing the energy use of buildings on campus, among others. However, the need to plan for a sustainable energy future has heretofore not been confronted in the board room, where endowments have not faced scrutiny and transparency from an environmental perspective. Thus, our university faces the charge of being hypocritical: What message does the university send when it supports research programs and grants degrees with such titles as ""renewable and sustainable energy,"" ""air pollution control"" and ""environmental science"" while it invests at the same time in activities that exacerbate the very problems that these programs are intended to solve?
\
University endowments face tangible financial risks from their investment in fossil fuels. Efforts are underway to enforce a carbon tax and provide tax relief for energy conservation and non-fossil energy technology. These congressional efforts can result in a loss of value of fossil-fuel holdings, principally in the form of stranded assets, lowering the value of investment portfolios that hold such shares.
\
Political instabilities in oil-producing countries can lead to energy crises, such as the oil embargo by Arab nations after the Six-Day war in 1967. Such crises can lower the value of petroleum stocks and lead to intervention by the U.S. military, such as the Iraq war. After my text book ""Principles of Sustainable Energy"" was published three years ago, I was invited by the U.S. Air Force Academy to give a talk to their engineering students. When I asked the instructor why the topic of sustainable energy was of interest to the cadets, the colonel teaching the course replied, ""Energy security is the key to national security.""
\
Republican Regent John Carson said in the discussion about divestiture that CU will ""not start choosing investiture based on people's political views."" But unless it is politicized, investiture is not a political issue. Divestiture is a mechanism that can bring the research and teaching functions of the university into harmony with its financial practices and deserves support irrespective of a regent's political view.
\
A frequent argument against divestment is that low-carbon energy is more expensive than fossil fuels and a transition will impose a significant cost on Colorado. But onshore wind power as well as conservation measures are actually cheaper then electricity from fossil fuels and the cost from photovoltaic technologies is plummeting, having dropped from $50 per watt in the 1970s to below $1 per watt today. And Colorado has many pumped storage sites to store energy when the sun is not shining or the wind not blowing. Colorado can become the leader of sustainable energy if properly supported.
\
Planning for a sustainable energy future is an essential mission of higher education and that includes facing man's adverse effect of fossil fuels on the climate. Universities have an obligation to their students, alumni and society to prepare for a sustainable future and explain the risks posed by depletion of fossil energy resources and climate change. Once divestiture of holdings in the fossil-fuel industry has become a goal for the university's operation, there will be ample resources in our business school to provide analytic tools and support for intelligent planning. Divestiture is feasible and, if properly implemented, will not threaten the financial health of university endowments. It deserves the support of all levels of the University of Colorado.

90,"Label: COMMENTARY\ Colorado was the setting of a meeting to help shape world events, affectingthe lives of all Americans. The Summit of Eight a meeting of high-level representatives from the major industrialized nations focuson environmental issues, with global warming high on the list.\ Despite the scientific uncertainties and enormous economic consequences, many fearthe meeting would have resultedin a call to unilateral action that will harm the United Statesand do little to solve the global warming problem if it even exists. Thankfully, it did not.\ The summit significantly impact negotiations now underway in preparation for a climate change treaty in Kyoto, Japan this December. Several countries, including the United States are pushing for a binding treaty to reduce `greenhouse gases` produced by industrialized countries below 1990 levels. The costs will be enormous, but benefits to the environment appear negligible.\ Charles River Associates, an econometric modeling firm, has estimated that dministration plans will increase U.S. unemployment by a quarter of a percent and constrain Gross Domestic Product by 3.3 percent. The effect: 250,000 lost Americans jobs and a cost of $2,700 per household. Studies also show that a carbon tax would increase the cost of gasoline up to 60 cents a gallon.\ Faced with these costs, the AFL-CIO's Executive Council met in February in Los Angeles to consider a resolution critical of the Clinton Administration's plan to impose the treaty on developed countries and failure to perform an economic analysis of the treaty's costs. Despite Vice President Al Gore's personal plea to reject it, the Executive Committee passed the resolution.\ In Bonn, Germany, labor made clear its resolve. Spokesman Bill Cunningham said labor finds it `amazing that harsh, arbitrary flat-rate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (imposed only on developed countries), are being proposed and contemplated without regard to their impact on working people. It's even more galling when we find that there is no scientific evidence (this) will solve the greenhouse problem. In fact, it might even exacerbate it.` Many fear that the treaty will do nothing to avert the threat of global warming because it exempts countries such as China, Korea, India, Mexico and Brazil from reducing their emissions.\ Developing or not, China already is the second largest greenhouse gas producer in the world. And computer modeling shows that China's emissions under the treaty will continue to grow for another 50 years.\ Thus, even if the global warming theory is real, we will do more long-term harm to the planet than good by rushing forward with half-solutions.\ Ironically, there is little consensus over whether global warming is occurring. Only 17 percent of the Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Society membership believes greenhouse gas emissions caused the warming earlier this century. And according to the May issue of Science magazine, scientists who conducted the U.N.-sponsored study which forms the scientific justification for the treaty `say it will be a decade before computer models can confidently link the warming to human activities\ Even Sierra Club Conservation Director Bruce Hamilton, recently said `If you look at the science, it's all over the board.` Before governments help roll back years of economic progress, perhaps we should thoroughly understand the complexities of what we face.\ Once we verify that a problem exists and understand its scope and nature, then we can move forward in an informed manner that addresses the issue intelligently. By using caution and common sense now, we can ensure a promising future for our children, one that is neither hot nor poor.\ - Norton is attorney general of Colorado and chairs the Coalition of Republican Environmental Activists' Advisory Board. Shanahan is vice president and counsel of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, a bipartisan public policy institution.\ @QUOTE: Even Sierra Club Conservation Director Bruce Hamilton, recently said, ""If you look at the science, it's all over the board.""

Some municipalization supporters recently did an analysis of Xcel's Colorado pre-tax profits, based on Xcel's multi-state corporate filings: Colorado now accounts for nearly half of Xcel's profits, although our customer base is far smaller than Xcel's in Minnesota, and even a smaller fraction if you include the other six states where Xcel also provides power. In the eight years from 2004 to 2012, Xcel's Colorado pre-tax profit more than doubled, even though sales and generation capacity were essentially flat. Amazingly, the same data was presented in a strong article in redstate.com, a notorious conservative website. (Google ""kyle forti xcel colorado"" .) Apparently both the left and the right are upset about the increase in Xcel's Colorado profits.
\
Boulder, of course, is part of Xcel's profit machine. The same local people calculated that Boulder contributes something like $35 million a year to Xcel's windfall. This excess is, to some extent, a function of the exorbitant almost-guaranteed 10-plus percent rate of return on invested equity that is awarded by the Public Utilities Commission, and which is based on some rather circular legal arguments that have lost their connection to reality, in my opinion.
\
Some will argue that, after all, Xcel is just a business like any other, and should pursue profit like any other. But that argument is not valid -- Xcel has no real competition, other than if a city tries to go ""muni,"" and you can see how hard Xcel is resisting Boulder's attempt to exercise this constitutionally granted power. More importantly, the whole profit-above-all motivation also raises the issue of exactly how are we to solve climate change, if investor owned utilities, as well as most major electricity consumers, are businesses that are just focused on increasing profits? (Commercial and industrial buildings account for roughly three quarters of Boulder's energy consumption.)
\
One obvious approach is to include external costs, such as the effects of climate change, in the cost of energy by imposing a large carbon tax. But although some costs are calculable, some are effectively infinite. How do you place a finite value on the loss of a large fraction of Earth's species, or the starvation of a portion of the human population, or the destruction of habitat or loss of agricultural land? Even the cost of increased flood risk in the Civic Center redevelopment area on Boulder Creek is tough to assess. Another approach, more practical at least for us in Boulder, is to focus on changing how the economics of power generation work so that incentives are aligned toward reduction rather than increase in consumption.
\
For investor-owned utilities in fully regulated markets like Colorado, the big incentives are lined up toward more investments in power plants, such as occurred under the Clean Air Clean Jobs Act, where Xcel was rewarded for investing in rebuilding some coal plants while also being paid to shut down others. In contrast, a municipal utility that purchases most of its power has every incentive to minimize costs. So a muni like Boulder would have a strong interest in increasing customers' investments in efficiency and demand management right up to the point where those costs equal the savings from avoiding the next power purchase contract.
\
But that still leaves us with shifting our energy supply toward renewable energy and move toward carbon neutrality faster than the economics of private monopoly power production dictate. This is where Boulder's muni can lead the way --- we can show other cities that we can have a realistic and economically feasible path to achieving carbon-neutrality, that we can shift from selling energy as a commodity to delivering energy as a service, that we can do this in our most difficult Colorado regulatory environment (somewhat like Minnesota's, where Minneapolis, the home of Xcel, is considering going muni), and that we can actually get some reasonable rulings on stranded costs from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which will help others to chart their courses with more certainty.
\
""That where a community -- a city or county or a district -- is not satisfied with the service rendered or the rates charged by the private utility, it has the undeniable basic right, as one of its functions of Government, one of its functions of home rule, to set up, after a fair referendum to its voters has been had, its own governmentally owned and operated service.""

Even before President Barack Obama took the stage for his victory speech Tuesday night, environmentalists were laying out their expectations for his second term: act on climate change, whether it's through sweeping legislative action, regulatory rules or decisions like blocking the Keystone XL pipeline.
\
Just minutes after the race was called Tuesday, the group 350.org announced a Keystone XL protest on Nov. 18. Young climate activists who joined the celebration outside the White House held up a sign saying ""Sandy Demands Climate Action Now,"" a reference to the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy.
\
One line in Obama's victory speech gave the green groups hope that he might act.
\
""We want our children to live in an America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet,"" the president said.
\
But taking action to achieve those goals isn't going to be easy. While more than a dozen legislators targeted by environmental groups for their votes on clean energy and climate change bills were defeated in the election, neither chamber switched parties. With the status quo likely to continue in Congress, environmental groups say they'll pressure the White House to continue, or amplify, its work of the last four years.
\
There's even a push for Obama to take a larger role on the world's stage. In a statement congratulating Obama, a spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the secretary general looks forward to working with the president on ""tackling the challenges posed by climate change,"" among other issues.
\
Obama's biggest challenge, however, will be getting legislation through Congress. Many environmental groups expect that, given Republican opposition in the House, the administration will continue using its regulatory authority to pass environmentally friendly regulations. In Obama's first term, the Environmental Protection Agency set the first greenhouse gas limits on new power plants, proposed the first national standard for mercury from coal facilities and bolstered fuel economy rules for passenger vehicles.
\
By the end of the year the EPA also is expected to release a rule that would limit pollution from existing power plants and refineries. Before the election, there were reports that the EPA was trying to push the power plant rule out quickly, in case Mitt Romney won the presidency.
\
""For the next couple of months, we expect to see the EPA just finishing the business at hand. Chief among that is addressing pollution from power plants and what waters can be regulated under the Clean Water Act,"" said David Goldston, senior adviser to the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund.
\
In a second term, the EPA could consider rules governing coal ash waste and ground-level pollution, analysts say.
\
Groups that generally oppose action on climate change are, like the environmental groups, girding for what might be coming from the White House.
\
""This election really didn't change much in terms of the dynamic in Washington in the sense that President Obama stays in the White House and Congress stays the same,"" said James Taylor, senior fellow for environmental policy for the Heartland Institute, a noted climate skeptic group. ""So we'll probably just see this battle where EPA is taking severe measures and a different path than Congress might have taken.""
\
Eric Pooley, senior vice president for strategy and communications for the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), said his group already plans to push the federal and state governments to look beyond carbon and address ""climate accelerants"" like methane and refrigerants. On methane, Pooley said, that means addressing potential leakage from natural gas extraction.
\
EDF has been criticized by some green groups for supporting hydraulic fracturing, the controversial gas extraction method, albeit with restrictions. But Pooley said it's important to use natural gas as a bridge fuel and to ensure that the extraction is as safe and clean as possible, which requires federal leadership. The EPA is studying fracking, but it's unclear if any regulation will come out of that research.
\
Like most of Washington, environmental groups will be watching how Obama deals with Congress on the approaching fiscal cliff. If a budget deal isn't reached to reduce the national debt, across-the-board cuts through the budgetary sequester could go into effect in January with potentially dire consequences for the environment, they say.
\
The sequester could mean the closure of some National Parks, the elimination of some National Wildlife Refuges and cuts to coastal management programs, according to a fact sheet assembled by NRDC, The Wilderness Society, Defenders of Wildlife and the National Parks Conservation Association.
\
""The environmental community has a lot at stake. ... Sequestration could cripple environmental programs now and into the future,"" said NRDC Action's Goldston.
\
Goldston said a deal should include raising money by cutting subsidies for, ""industries that are mature, wealthy and produce pollutants.""
\
Environmental groups say the Democrats' slightly expanded majority in the Senate offers some hope for extending the wind production tax credit for renewable energy. They predict the industry will face layoffs and other setbacks if the credit is allowed to expire at the end of the year.
\
The EDF's Pooley said the administration should at least start a conversation about instituting a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system.
\
""Ultimately, if you're serious about cutting carbon emissions, you've got to price it,"" Pooley said.

A University of Colorado professor who's been a polarizing figure in the climate change debate is being investigated by a Democratic congressman from Arizona over whether he's received research funding from fossil fuel companies.
\
Both professor Roger Pielke Jr. -- who denies claims that he's a climate change skeptic -- and the CU administration on Wednesday said that's absolutely not the case.
\
""Professor Pielke is a highly regarded faculty member who is clearly operating under the principles of academic freedom, which we strongly defend,"" CU Provost Russell Moore said. ""We stand behind him. His research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other credible organizations.
\
""None of his research has been funded by oil companies or fossil fuel interests.""
\
In a letter dated Tuesday and addressed to CU President Bruce Benson, U.S. Rep. Racl Grijalva asked the university to disclose all sources and amounts of Pielke's external funding.
\
""I am hopeful that the disclosure of a few key pieces of information will establish the impartiality of climate research and policy recommendations published in your institution's name and assist me and my colleagues in making better law,"" wrote Grijalva, a ranking member of the House Committee on Natural Resources.
\
""Companies with a direct financial interest in climate and air quality standards are funding environmental research that influences state and federal regulations and shapes public understanding of climate science.""
\
Grijalva's staff did not respond to interview requests Wednesday.
\
In a post on his blog, Pielke -- who directs CU's Center for Science Technology Policy Research -- wrote that he has disclosed all possible conflicts of interest and has no funding ""declared or undeclared, with any fossil fuel company or interest.""
\
""I know with complete certainty that this investigation is a politically motivated 'witch hunt' designed to intimidate me (and others) and to smear my name,"" wrote Pielke, who is currently out of the country.
\
Reached Wednesday, Pielke deferred to his blog post on the matter.
\
CU system spokesman Ken McConnellogue said the university is ""determining what information we need to gather that is responsive to the request.""
\
Grijalva asked university officials to respond with the requested materials by March 16.
\
Controversial figure in climate science
\
Pielke has long been a polarizing figure among climate change scientists.
\
He has written extensively on climate-change economics, and testified before Congress that it is incorrect to associate the increasing costs of disasters with the emission of greenhouse gases.
\
Yet Pielke does not dub himself a climate-change denier, nor a skeptic, arguing that much of his testimony is the consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He has also publicly supported a carbon tax as a way of reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
\
Six other academics at post-secondary institutions also are being investigated, two of which -- Steven Hayward and Judith Curry -- previously taught on the Boulder campus. Hayward served as the first-ever visiting scholar in conservative thought and policy last year.
\
The investigation, according to Grijalva, stems from the recent report that Dr. Willie Soon of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics accepted climate research funding from corporate interests.
\
Some of this research was later presented to the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, and the Kansas State Legislature's House Energy and Environment Committee.
\
""If true, these may not be isolated incidents,"" Grijalva wrote. ""John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, has highlighted what he believes were serious misstatements by Prof. Pielke of the scientific consensus on climate change.""
\
'McCarthy-like tactics'
\
Even so, some question whether this warrants a political investigation.
\
Eric Steig, a professor of Earth and space science at the University of Washington and a blogger at Real Climate, long has been a critic of Pielke.
\
""Pielke Jr. has voiced provocative and uninformed statements about climate and climate scientists, and it's safe to say he's not very popular among mainstream scientists,"" Steig told the Daily Camera. ""That's all the more reason to speak up when it appears Congress may well be abusing its power.""
\
Steig cited two other well-known investigations of scientists, and he said he suspected the investigation of Pielke also had little merit.
\
""All of this seems to me part of a worrying tendency that began with the Republican administration, but to which Democrats are by no means immune, to use McCarthy-like tactics,"" Steig said.
\
Other climate change scientists echoed Steig's concern about the increasing politicization of science.
\
'He's a good scientist'
\
Jim White, the director of CU's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, studies global-scale climate and environmental dynamics. In the 1980s, his research on ice cores helped to show that large climate changes tend to occur in the natural system as abrupt and rapid shifts driven by internal adjustments in the Earth climate system.
\
""What I would object to most is lumping scientists who speak out on one side of a topic together and saying that because there's one bad apple that must mean they're all bad apples,"" White said of the seven academics being investigated.
\
""I've known Roger for a long time,"" White added. ""Roger speaks his mind. But he's a good scientist. He doesn't need to have a whole bunch of money thrown at him by oil and gas companies to do what he does. That's not him.""
\
Moreover, White said, there are checks and balances in place to ensure this wouldn't happen. Frequent evaluations prevent academics from hiding under-the-table funding.
\
Paul Chinowsky, head of the Boulder Faculty Assembly, also noted the importance of the peer review process in preventing questionable research.
\
""As researchers we are subject to many, many peer reviews,"" he said. ""The whole concept of academic freedom is research without influence. So we have to ask -- is this an investigation because of sound questions of science?
\
""Or is this an investigation because of political agenda?""

Matt Isenhower was sick of sitting in traffic. As the 34-year-old Navy veteran from Redmond, Washington, vanpooled 80 minutes to and from his job at Amazon in Seattle each day, he had plenty of time to lament the state Senate's refusal to invest in mass transit. Roughly 58 percent of Washington's carbon emissions come from the tailpipes of cars, trucks and other vehicles, and the Republicancontrolled Senate had also stymied Gov. Jay Inslee's attempts to forge a bipartisan agreement to limit greenhouse gasses.
\
Hoping to end the gridlock, Isenhower decided to run for state Senate. With his freshly shaven good looks, military background and Harvard MBA, Democrats thought Isenhower had a good shot at unseating Republican Andy Hill. And in this election year, that was a pretty big deal: If liberals could take just two seats in Washington's Senate, Inslee - a clean-energy champion and one of America's governors - would have a pro-environment majority in both chambers. There's no doubt what he could do with that kind of opportunity: Next year, Inslee hopes to release a sweeping plan that could make Washington the second state in the nation (after California) to slash carbon emissions across the economy by putting a price on them.
\
With the U.S. Congress growing less and less friendly to climate policy, environmental groups like the League of Conservation Voters and NextGen Climate are increasingly looking to progressive states like Washington to lead the way. 'The need for taking action on climate is stronger than ever,"" says Gregg Small, director of the Olympia-based advocacy group Climate Solutions. ""And (the Pacific Northwest) is one of the few places that has the desire to do it."" That's why environmentalists spent millions of dollars greeneôopyttÿiJrè&gtr^ogLilitiryebi©ws:liinate-friendly legislatures for both Inslee and Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber. Isenhower was one of the candidates they bankrolled.
\
But unprecedented spending by greens didn't save the U.S. Senate for Democrats, and it didn't turn Washington's red Senate blue. Isenhower lost. So did two other Washington Democrats who received outside money.
\
The results mean that any aggressive carbon-cutting plan put forth by Inslee will undoubtedly face more hurdles. But it doesn't mean Northwestern states will simply throw in the towel. Kerry McHugh, spokeswoman for the Washington Environmental Council, says Oregon and Washington may still join California in showing the nation that taking meaningful action on climate change need not cause economic ruin. ""The West Coast as a whole has been a place where interesting new policies have been incubated in the past,"" McHugh says, ""and I think that's going to be the case again.""
\
One reason for McHugh's optimism is the Pacific Coast Action Plan on Climate and Energy, a non-binding agreement signed last year by Washington, Oregon, California and British Columbia. Among other things, the plan requires Washington and Oregon to cut carbon, either through cap-and-trade (as California already does) or by taxing it (British Columbia's strategy). Inslee's forthcoming legislation, the details of which are still fuzzy, is Washington's first step toward upholding its commitment. Oregon may not be far behind.
\
But with oil-industry supporter Doug Ericksen still heading the Washington Senate Energy Committee, does Inslee's vision of a carbon market stand a chance? In the last session, Ericksen blocked legislation limiting oil trains, watered down a bill for a carbon emissions study, and hosted a retired professor who told the Senate that ""carbon dioxide cannot possibly cause global warming."" Inslee says he's willing to compromise with Ericksen and other Republicans, but he also has an ace up his sleeve: Earlier this year, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that the state is violating its Constitution by not adequately funding K-through-12 education. Lawmakers need to come up with billions of dollars for education, and the revenue that cap-and-trade or a carbon tax would generate might be an awfully appealing source.
\
There are other reasons for hope, too. The day after the election, Inslee reaffirmed his dedication to cutting carbon at an energy conference. He laid out ideas to streamline residential and commercial solar permits, encourage more electric vehicles, and expand the state's renewable energy program, ideas that Inslee spokeswoman Jaime Smith says all have a decent chance of passing the GOP Senate. Even more importantly, Inslee has the authority to implement a major cleanfuels standard without introducing new legislation.
\
There's also Oregon, a bright spot for climate activists in an otherwise dreary election. Before Nov. 4, Oregon already had a Democratic majority in both chambers, but it wasn't strong enough to pass Gov. Kitzhaber's proposal to reduce the carbon intensity of fuels by 10 percent over the next 10 years. Now, Democrats have increased their majority in both chambers of the Oregon Legislature, putting Kitzhaber in an enviable position to pass his clean-fuels bill and other climate legislation. Kitzhaber hasn't been as outspoken or proactive as Inslee on climate issues, but there have been hints he's moving toward carbon pricing - and there's no doubt he sees climate policy as part of his legacy.
\
National environmental groups like 350.org are keeping a close eye on Oregon and plan to keep pressuring both Northwest states to implement aggressive carbon-cutting policies. ""With climate deniers in control of Congress, we need to look for progress elsewhere,"" says Jamie Herrn, 350. org's communications director. ""The next five years are critical. There's no time to twiddle our thumbs."" ?

Boulder voters will be asked to change up how city services are funded -- including exploring re-allocating taxes originally set for open space. What do you think?
\
One thumb up on the re-allocation of the open space tax toward basic city services. It makes no sense to allow one department to pursue its ""vision plan"" (and pile up liquid assets) while the other departments struggle to pursue their day to day business plans. Both Blue Ribbon Commissions would concur.
\
One thumb down on the ""We're too poor to pave"" tax. (Likewise for Boulder County, but that is a future editorial.)
\
The City of Boulder is not short on tax, it is long on ambition. Boulder is not content to manage city streets, libraries, urban parks, law enforcement, and fire safety. Boulder wants to: micromanage the built environment, overpower the housing market, own every mountain, fine-tune local demographics, overpower the automobile, make electricity meters run backwards, transform human nature, and in the process save the world. That stuff doesn't come cheap. But disguising this agenda as a budget shortfall is just plain disingenuous.
\
It is because Boulder is rich that it can entertain such stratospheric aspirations. I would propose something more like Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Let's take care of the basics before we brag about self-actualization. The freeing-up of the open space tax is a step in the right direction. The transportation tax is a step in the wrong direction.

Back in the 1960s through the '80s, there was something called the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). It provided funding for open space acquisitions by a number of federal agencies. Among them was the Bureau of Land Management.
\
But with growing federal budget deficits, the LWCF became a less reliable source for open space funding.
\
With federal funding shrinking in the '90s, many states, counties and municipalities responded by establishing their own funding programs. Boulder voters have supported such measures as a formula for keeping control on growth and sprawl, and retaining the city's character.
\
This is where we find Boulder today. Its City Council wants to add a 0.33 percent sales tax to cover expanding open spaces, but wants to take a third of that amount and add it to the city's general fund.
\
This maneuver raises questions, and voters wonder what the answers might be.
\
For example: What is so special about Boulder's open space?
\
Past experience proves that this community was willing to make sacrifices to preserve open space by taxing themselves. It was willing to do so to protect and preserve not only open space, but also farmland, historic buildings and our beautiful vistas.
\
The next question: Why has open space been chosen as the way to add to the city's general fund? And why do some citizens seem to think that existing open spaces funding should be reduced and applied elsewhere?
\
In the long run, preserving open space will increase and preserve the value of living in Boulder.

Now is the right time to have a conversation about whether and how to reallocate the resources obtained from our citizens and visitors via open space sales taxes due to expire in the relatively near future. Earmarked sales taxes create impenetrable silos around resources that, in any given year, could be used to address other needs and priorities. Open space acquisition taxes have been popular in the past, but the question can fairly be asked, ""have we reached a point of diminishing returns?"" The few remaining parcels are either not for sale or their cost is so exorbitant that patience, not a pot of gold, is called for.
\
If fewer dollars are needed to fund acquisition of significant parcels when reasonable opportunities present themselves, then some of the taxes people have been willing to pay, ought to be used for other public health, safety and welfare priorities that have been on the back burner for quite some time, including road maintenance, a core government function.
\
On Tuesday night, City Council compromised by choosing to deal with the 0.33 percent open space tax, leaving the 0.15 percent tax for the next council to address. Dollars generated for open space are front-loaded at the current rate, step down to 0.22 in 2020 and to 0.11 in 2030. The resulting revenue covers the ""everything we could think of"" vision plan with millions to spare. More than was asked for is enough. It's time to address other needs.

\
The City Council proposal to divert 33 percent of the open space sales tax to unspecified programs in the general fund is a shocking revelation that the long-term values of this community have been forgotten. This idea attacks one of the most valuable defining attributes of Boulder: its ability to put quality of life and a restraint to sprawl above other mundane urban wishes. No one should short-change Boulder's Sistine Chapel (as the OSMP has been called).
\
Departmental master plans, actually dream lists, are unfunded mandates. Master plans usually want more staff, facilities, and money than is realistic for a city that has a carrying capacity aka growth limit. Have we lost our vision of a compact town with fewer car trips and more biking and walking places? What if we cannot purchase and maintain the highest priority parcels at our borders? If our population doubles in the coming decades are present natural areas sufficient? Is growth covering its full cost? Have we lost our moral compass?
\
Once a huge bite is taken from the OSMP revenue won't there be more temptation to deplete this nationally recognized (and envied) Boulder symbol of sustainability by future less-thoughtful councils? Why not trim ambitious departmental master plans in order to enlarge our greenbelt water recharge areas, our hiking trails, dog walking paths, agricultural and historic lands, wildlife habitats and most important the spiritual recharge areas we call open space? Future generations will thank us.

A time-honored marketing device is the ""loss leader"" in which a big supermarket might advertise very low priced six-packs of chicken legs for July 4th. And where the product is displayed you will also see sauces, picnic supplies, soft drinks for the festivities, and voila -- all those are marked up to offset the mark down on the chicken handsomely. What's popular can be used to fund other purposes.
\
Even my pets have played this game. My dog, not being allowed into the bedroom, would partner with my beloved cat. In the mornings at the door came her meow; I dutifully opened it and -- bam -- the two were instantly on the bed. They knew how to play me.
\
Any city with a popular program tax will be drawn to this game. It's a credible way to move money, however the particular ballot item proposed for this fall is bizarre for seeking a one-third carve off from new open space funding for the general fund. One third? That's not a minor variation, that's confiscation -- and it suggests that prior patterns for funding were fundamentally broken.
\
Since restricted funds are destabilizing, all such streams (such as the carbon tax which funds so many of our ambitious projects) should also pitch in. Gotta dance with them that brought ya; this means that the exquisite projects this city loves to fund should give back to the basics like cops, fire fighting and roads.

It's that time of year when many people make predictions about what the next year will bring. What do you foresee in your community's future next year? What about in 50 or 100 years?
\
Having recently traveled to the Middle East, I was starkly reminded of the paradise I live in. Boulder is a land of no smoking, clean air and blue skies, abundant open space with bike paths and hiking trails, amazing Flatiron views, clean shopping malls, attractive architecture, remarkable restaurants and grocery stores, well-maintained roads, extraordinary K-12 schools, a world-class university, a thriving entrepreneurial environment, and, best of all, nice people.
\
In the near and far future, I expect Boulder to get even better--and more exclusive--with these likely enhancements:
\
Since our town is essentially built out, every 50-plus-year-old residence will be renovated or completely rebuilt. Similarly, our aging municipal buildings will be updated and expanded. And we'll eventually have a downtown convention center!
\
Our main thoroughfares will be widened further, and unexceptional intersections, such as 28th and Valmont, will have showcase contemporary structures on every corner.
\
The CU campus will keep expanding--more vertically than horizontally. To house its growing student population, additional high-rise dorms will adorn our skyline and, sorry to say, partially obstruct our mountain views.
\
We'll also see long-awaited improvements in transportation. Light rail will connect us to Denver--and all points in between. Moreover, Boulder will continue as a model for green cities.
\
The northwest area, the last bastion of old Boulder, will build out and modernize. At the other end, ""SoBo"" will add needed restaurants and fine-tune itself.
\
As the decades pass, Boulder will become even more beautiful and desirable.

Solar flares are expected to peak next year perhaps surprising teenagers with disruptions to their ipods, cell phones, GPS, and electronic gadgets dependant on our electrical grid. Asteroid DA-14 is expected to hopefully miss the Earth in February. This should feed new unfounded hysteria about the end of civilization. As an optimist in the coming years I see the end of the Cuban embargo, a much earlier exit from Afghanistan than in 2014, a total ban of assault weapons and multi-bullet clips, a heavy carbon tax on oil and gas exploitation and coal-fired power plants to mitigate climate change, and a compassionate amnesty program for immigrants who are currently in limbo.
\
In 2013 in Boulder I foresee a resurgence of bicycle--friendly innovations including several experimental streets with one of the multiple lanes dedicated to bike use only and RTD buses equipped to carry four bikes instead of the present double rack. Boulder will adopt a modified municipal electric utility whereby solar collectors will become widespread and affordable. City sales taxes will increase and the new revenue will provide all residents with an EcoPass.
\
In the next decade Boulder could become one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the country with a central business district converted into a pure pedestrian place with hundreds of international restaurants, multi-lingual street signs and retail outlets featuring products and travel packages from our sister cities. All city parks will have community (organic) gardens.

Most people's year-end predictions will be wrong. That's my prediction.
\
Past predictions of recognized ""experts"" have been lousy. In his award-winning book, ""Expert Political Judgment,"" psychologist Philip Tetlock evaluated more than 80 thousand predictions of 284 experts. In this case, an ""expert"" was a ""professional who makes his or her livelihood by commenting or offering advice on political and economic trends."" The result? After twenty years, the accuracy of ""expert"" predictions were hardly distinguishable from ""dilettantes"" or ""dart-throwing chimps.""
\
Reviewing Tetlock's book in The New Yorker, Louis Menand summarizes how experts go wrong. Talk show pundits, for example, have more incentive to be entertaining than to be correct. Experts tend to be wedded to their theories or ideologies, which makes them prone to confirmation bias that blinds them to facts that don't easily fit their worldview.
\
Tetlock found that more successful predictions came from ""foxes,"" who base predictions from a breadth of experiences and inputs, rather than ""hedgehogs"" whose predictions and explanations derive from a single paradigm.
\
If one person's drawing on a breadth of knowledge improves his prediction, then aggregating independent predictions of many people with different specialties should also yield quality predictions. Journalist James Surowiecki discusses this effect in his bestseller ""The Wisdom of Crowds."" For example, in 1968 the U.S. Navy aggregated the predictions from experts in different fields to locate the USS Scorpion, a submarine that had inexplicably sunk in the North Atlantic, killing 99 crewmen.

It is the year 2100. Residents of Boulder County and their regional neighbors are 90 years into their pattern-changing experiment in sustainable community development. Guided by practical wisdom, sound science and an entrepreneurial spirit, they have evolved new land use and development patterns that reconnect them to thriving ecosystems and agricultural zones, support a variety of dense, walkable village centers and nurture a diverse population of young and old, low-income and affluent, and people of all races and creeds.
\
Across the U.S., Boulder County is seen as the epitome of a new, twenty-second century American community -- one that is climate-smart, nature-friendly, economically resilient, healthy and affordable, with a commitment to innovation as a way of life.
\
Climate change, food security, potential manufacturing supply chain disruptions, in-commuters, population growth and a host of other issues have upped the ante not only for Boulder County, but for every other U.S. city and region that takes its future seriously. As with Boulder's open space initiative of the 1960s, today's challenges boil down to decisions about land use. How will we develop and, in some cases, ""de-develop"" our region, while supporting sustainable food production, clean air and water, an efficient transportation system, good jobs, and affordable shelter to enable residents and employees to sleep closer to where they work, shop and play?
\
We need to plan for a low-carbon future and embrace positive change in that direction, while rejecting Malthusian pessimism. Sooner is better.

Traveling the world in 2012 has provided new perspectives on local challenges and opportunities for the future. From Rwanda to Cambodia, I've seen how quickly societies are changing with access to information through new technologies. As Internet access spreads to the tiniest villages in developing countries, new populations are aware of everything from American politics to the latest YouTube dance video.
\
Boulder's lifestyle is emblematic of what much of the world strives to achieve. My hopeful prediction is that we will appreciate the incredible good fortune of living in such a vibrant, trend-setting community, and that we'll continue to devote our collective energy and intelligence toward innovation. While paving the way in some areas, we should also have the humility to adopt ideas from cultures that lead the way in areas where we are behind (e.g., mass transit, healthcare).
\
Areas where Boulder leads include advancement of renewable energy and acceptance of LGBT families. I predict that the next year will make it clearer whether we will need to take complete control of our energy future versus pulling Xcel Energy toward meeting our goals. And as the nation removes discriminatory laws on same-sex relationships, Boulder LGBT residents will find themselves increasingly integrated and supported.
\
As depressing news bombards us of late, let's show the nation how to break out of this funk and move forward with optimism so that a century from now our children's children will enjoy a better world.

It's depressing: WALL-E's junk piles, Waterworld's climate, Total Recall""s destruction. Happily, technology will prevent most bad stuff from happening. More worrisome is the ability of psychology and sociology to deal with change in human relationships.
\
Polarization in Boulder will escalate as demographic trends of lower fertility and higher urbanization join forces with the human tendency to distrust strangers. Estrangement will increase as families become smaller and people live apart in individual dwellings. They will be less inclined to marry and have children. Fertility will drop, leading to fewer ""ties that bind."" Individuals will turn to the government to take care of them, leading to fewer reasons to form human relationships.
\
More urbanization means living surrounded by strangers. Ironically, the closer people live together, the higher the walls tend to grow between them. Eric Klinenberg, NYU sociologist, believes these ""masses of city-dwelling singles will sort themselves into urban tribes,"" based on common interests, like the foodies, athletes, and animal-lovers. Crossing tribal boundaries to form relationships will become rarer.
\
Lower fertility and increased urbanization are a reality in our city. They can lead to estrangement and polarization. Breaking this cycle will require a concerted effort to reach out to strangers, swallow our self-righteousness, and cross political boundaries. If we don't, our light-hearted city has a good chance of becoming hateful and distrustful, like those in Waterworld and Total Recall. It would become a place where I really don't want to live.

"
99,"""In the past people deliberately lied, or they unconsciously coloured what they wrote, or they struggled after the truth, well knowing that they must make many mistakes; but in each case they believed that 'facts' existed and were more or less discoverable. It is just this common basis of agreement, with its implication that human beings are all one species of animal, that totalitarianism destroys."" - George Orwell\""Who cares whether they laugh at us or insult us, treating us as fools or criminals? The point is that they talk about us and constantly think about us."" - Adolf Hitler\Last month, on the Friday after Thanksgiving, the federal government released the second volume of its Fourth National Climate Assessment, warning that global warming increasingly threatens our nation's environment, our health and our prosperity. When asked the following Monday to comment on the assessment, the product of 13 government agencies and 300 scientists, President Donald Trump said simply: ""I don't believe it.""\That same day, Alex Jones' conspiracy-fueled website, Infowars, cited a tweet by the president - ""Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?"" - to attack the report, impugning its researchers as potential ""connivers for the United Nations' carbon tax scam ⋯ shilling to fund Agenda 21 totalitarianism hysteria."" And just like that, the president had all the rhetorical cover he needed to justify his anti-environmental policies.\Welcome to Alt-America, a topsyturvy world of conspiracy theories, half-baked ideas and ""alternative facts,"" where trolls are real and news is fake, where facts don't matter, and lies don't either. This shadow realm was a favorite haunt of Donald Trump before he ran for president, and gained greater prominence with his election. We all live in Alt-America now, awash in its alternative realities, propaganda and the kind of doublespeak that George Orwell made famous in his 1949 novel, 1984, so it's probably a good time to ask how we got here, and where it all leads.\In Alt-America: The Rise of the Radical Right in the Age of Trump, journalist and author David Neiwert charts the emergence of alternative realities and their spread across extremist groups. This, he argues, primed the electorate for the rise of Trump and has buoyed him ever since. Neiwert traces this contingent of the president's supporters back to the 1990s Patriot movement - a collage of antigovernment groups - and the rise of online misogynists, white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other manifestations of extremism.\From its beginning, the Patriot movement promoted white supremacy, Christian identity and conspiracy theories, fearing FEMA-sponsored concentration camps, black helicopter surveillance, a New World Order and chemtrails. Patriot ideology fractured like light through a prism with the rise of right-wing radio, conservative cable TV and the internet - what David Foster Wallace called ""a kaleidoscope of information options."" The more available these options became, the less the public was able to debate the facts. Ultimately, the improbable ideas of paranoiacs made their way into mainstream political conversations, online and at the table.\The Patriots and other fringe groups have since thrived. They have myriad manifestations - Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, sovereign citizens, border militias, constitutional sheriffs - but the movement still draws strength from ""a deep vein of antigovernment sentiment that had been simmering among conservatives for many years,"" Neiwert writes. In August 2016, when candidate Trump suggested that the ""Second Amendment people"" do something about his opponent, Hillary Clinton, he was appealing to this group, showing that once-inconceivable political speech is now viable, even advantageous.\As Alt-America emerged, so did its Western corollary. Neiwert spends two full chapters on Patriot-supported standoffs between the Bundys and the feds. He recalls the racist speeches of Cliven Bun-dy outside Bunkerville, Nevada, where the elder Bundy suggested ""the Negro"" may have been better off as a slave. Here, Neiwert correctly links the white supremacist roots of the Patriot movement to its resurgence under President Barack Obama, the nation's first black president. (Donald Trump's first foray into alt-politics was his relentless support of the so-called ""birther"" conspiracy, which claimed President Barack Obama was not a U.S. citizen.)\Neiwert links this kind of alternative thinking with Bundyism, the ideology that brought about the Nevada standoff; the siege of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon; the illegal ""protest"" ride of ATVs through Utah's Recapture Canyon; and the militia-vs.-government conflicts over the Sugar Pine and White Hope mines, in Oregon and Montana.\These are all versions of alternate reality, self-reinforcing and powerful. ""The Internet made possible alternative universes such as the one inhabited by the adherents of the Patriot movement, or Alex Jones's conspiracy milieu: constructed of fabrications based on fragments, interacting with others' shared realities but operating almost entirely within its own framework,"" Neiwert writes. ""It began as a relatively small world limited largely to a fringe in the 1990s, but was resilient and grew steadily as the new century advanced. In the end, it gave birth not just to the alt-right but also to the much larger universe of Alt-America.""\Where does this lead? Nowhere good. As journalist and literary critic Michiko Kakutani writes in The Death of Truth: Notes on Falsehood in the Age of Trump, we now live in a place where ""truth increasingly seems to be in the eye of the beholder, facts are fungible and socially constructed, and we often feel as if we've been transported to an upside-down world where assumptions and alignments in place for decades have suddenly been turned inside out.""\This helps explain why, she writes, ""47 percent of Republicans erroneously believe that Trump won the popular vote, 68 percent believe that millions of illegal immigrants voted in 2016, and more than half of Republicans say they would be okay with postponing the 2020 presidential election until such problems with illegal voting can be fixed,"" and why ""25 percent of Americans believe that the 2008 (financial) crash was secretly orchestrated by a small cabal of bankers, 19 percent believe that the U.S. government had a hand in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and 11 percent even believe a theory made up by the researchers - that compact fluorescent lightbulbs were part of a government plot to make people more passive and easy to control.""\These falsehoods gave rise to Trump, yes, but Trump is not the water, he's a big Ol' catfish, and Kakutani gracefully describes the murky pond we all share with him. Some of this mental gunk comes from the passive intake of alternative reality through social media, but some is the active work of populists. One of their more insidious efforts, as Kakutani describes it, is ""the populist Right's appropriation of postmodernist arguments and its embrace of the philosophical repudiation of objectivity - schools of thought affiliated for decades with the Left and with the very elite academic circles that Trump and company scorn."" These efforts ""deny an objective reality existing independently from human perception"" and have attacked scientific theories as socially constructed, ""informed by the identity of the person positing the theory and the values of the culture in which they are formed; therefore, science cannot possibly make claims to neutrality or universal truths.""\When Trump says he doesn't ""believe"" the U.S. government's own climate assessment, he is asserting that his belief is what matters. It's a common mode now, feeling over fact, part of mainstream Republican thought, and easy to spot. Consider the following exchange, recounted by Kakutani, between CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota and GOP operative Newt Gingrich, at the 2016 Republican National Convention.\""The current view is that liberals have a whole set of statistics which theoretically may be right, but it's not where human beings are,"" Gingrich said, in defense of Trump's law-and-order remarks. ""People are frightened. People feel that their government has abandoned them.""\When Camerota pointed out that statistics showing that the country was more safe, not less, weren't ""liberal numbers,"" but rather compiled by the FBI, Gingrich countered: ""No, but what I said is equally true. People feel it.""\Here, then, is the real danger. Right now, we live in a country not only fueled by raw emotions, but steered by them as well. This can be dangerous on either extreme of the political spectrum, but today it's coming from far-right populism. People feel that immigrants are taking jobs, that America is unsafe and sullied. They believe that America was once great, with its white ruling class and people in their proper places. They feel afraid, and so have thrown open the door to authoritarianism. This distortion permits the president to co-opt terms like ""fake news,"" or to attack journalists as ""enemies of the people,"" invoking, incredibly, a term used by Lenin, Stalin and the genocidal leaders of the Khmer Rouge, at no political cost. It emboldens a president who lies for the ""same reason that Vladimir Putin lies,"" according to journalist Masha Gessen: ""to assert power over truth itself.""\Suddenly, comparisons to 1984 (Amazon's bestselling book in the month before Trump's inauguration) cut too close for comfort. Kakutani quotes 1984 at length, as it describes how ""the party and Big Brother exert control over reality"" by controlling speeches, statistics and records, so that ""no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admitted. For to change one's mind, or even one's policy, is a confession of weakness. ⋯ Thus history is continuously rewritten.""\Compare that fiction to reality, Kakutani suggests, when, after Trump's Inauguration, ""changes were being made to the climate change pages on the White House website,"" as environmental activists ""were frantically trying to download and archive government climate data - worried that it might be destroyed or lost or hidden by a hostile administration. Some of their fears were realized later in 2017, when the EPA announced that its website was 'undergoing changes that reflect the agency's new direction,' including this Orwellian phrase: 'updating language to reflect the approach of new leadership.' "" Thus history is rewritten.\That was more than a year ago, a very long time in Alt-America. Today, the president doesn't need to scrub information from his government's websites. Why bother? The Fourth National Climate Assessment was required by law and therefore unavoidable, undertaken in good faith by public servants and scientists who still believe in facts and reality. None of that matters, though, because ""I don't believe it"" is the only fact the great leader needs."
100,"Colorado Springs Fire Chief Chris Riley and Colorado Springs Utilities CEO Jerry Forte speak at a news conference\Read more at http://gazette.com/martin-drake-power-plant-fire-determined-accidental/multimedia/video/3544194428001#FDVU5EmZc7HOAJUi.99\Video: Colorado Springs Fire Chief Chris Riley and Colorado Springs Utilities CEO Jerry Forte speak at a recent news conference. Video by Andrea Sinclair.\-\Environmental activist Leslie Weise is amazed that the Colorado Springs City Council will not consider closing Martin Drake Power Plant in the next five years.\It was, after all, among 12 scenarios outlined in a half-million-dollar consultant's report for the council to consider in its deliberations over when to decommission the downtown coal-fired plant. It also was the scenario that had the best combined financial and environmental outcomes, she said.\This month's fire inside the Drake plant highlighted the risks of running an aging coal-fired plant in the middle of downtown, Weise said. Cheap power comes at the high price of health, safety and the environment, she said.\Weise, a Monument attorney whose clients have clean energy and sustainability missions, is seeking support in the Colorado Springs business community to pressure the council to reconsider a short-term life for the 52-year-old power plant.\About a dozen business leaders have joined the cause by signing a letter, which likely will be presented to the council, in its role as the Colorado Springs Utilities Board, at its meeting Wednesday.\""There is a large scope of people besides just environmentalists who question that plant,"" she said.\In March, a majority of the council indicated that closing Drake in the short term - meaning less than six years - is off the discussion table. It would not be enough time to plan for life post-Drake, which provides about one-third of the city's power. It would take longer to plan and build a replacement power source, the council members said. Instead, the council will consider a decommissioning date nine to 15 years out, or longer. The council said it would like to make a decision on Drake by the end of summer.\""I was surprised, personally, to see that everyone (on the council) was looking at mid- and long-term dates,"" council member Andy Pico said. ""That is a function of cost associated with near-term closure and what it would cost to replace as well as the investment we already put into it.""\This week, the council will be asked by the Utilities staff to decide how much weight it will put on the social and environmental costs when deciding Drake's fate. In a dozen options presented to the council, a consultant outlined the financial costs of closing Drake in three years on up to 30 years. It also attempted to outline the environmental, social and health costs for each option.\Weise said one of the options the council dismissed would close Drake by 2019 and would save an estimated $753 million in social and environmental costs.\""For them to look at the community with a straight face and say we will ignore the environmental, economic, health and social costs - well, they need to be straight and tell us that,"" said Weise, whose sister, Linda Weise, is executive director of the Colorado Springs Conservatory in downtown Colorado Springs.\But Sean Paige, a former City Council member who recently was a panelist for the El Pomar Foundation's forum on Drake, argues that Drake's decommissioning date should not be arbitrarily set.\Instead, the council should revisit the issue each year, checking on the power plant's performance, market prices and federal regulations, he said.\""We don't know the regulatory landscape in two years; we don't know the market conditions,"" Paige said. ""There is no harm in planning and trying to set deadlines, but realistically, this is something that should be decided as we go along in light of changing circumstances.""\Pico said there is a lesson to learn from the fire at Drake: that it costs twice as much to produce electricity from natural gas as from coal. Since the fire, Drake has been shut down and Utilities has relied on its natural gas-fired power plant and is buying natural gas on the market to produce electricity. It costs about $3 million more a month.\The City Council will be asked May 27 to increase electric rates by about 7 percent for Utilities customers - about $5 a month increase for a typical customer - to cover those costs.\""There is a daily cost that will hit everyone right now,"" Pico said. ""That is the cost of generation of natural gas.""\Drake's three boilers, Nos. 5, 6 and 7, were built in 1962, 1968 and 1974. Early reports are that only unit No. 5 was damaged in the fire, but Utilities officials are assessing the damage and costs to repair.\Meanwhile, cities across the country are shuttering coal plants. More than 30 coal-fired plants have closed in the wake of strict Environmental Protection Agency regulations, including emissions control.\Last year, the Utilities board set up the Drake Task Force to begin discussing when or if the power plant should be shut down. But it had signed contracts for scrubber technology to remove carbon dioxide, one of the pollutants targeted by federal rules.\According to the consultant's report, it would cost about $5.2 billion in capital costs, fixed operating costs, operations and maintenance costs and fuel costs to operate Drake until 2033. Those costs include the installation of scrubber technology.\Closing Drake by 2019, as Weise suggests, would mean shutting down the scrubber project, which is underway and has about 70 percent of the $131 million committed.\Those financial investments are among reasons council President Keith King wants to keep Drake open long term, he said.\""This plant might be very clean and very functional for a longer period once we get (scrubbers) up and running,"" he said.\The 12 options for Drake include the costs of building a replacement power source, adding renewable energy, offering demand side management incentives and adding to the Front Range natural gas plant. The best financial option is to keep Drake open for 30 years, according to the consultant's report. Then, Utilities would see a more than $200 million return on its investment, the report said.\When looking strictly at the financial return on investment, there is not much cost difference among the 12 options, said Cliff Kotnik, a member of the Southeastern Colorado Renewable Energy Society.\But an immediate closure of Drake has more social and environmental benefits including avoiding spending $753 million - the monetized value of the repercussions of greenhouse gas emission and other environmental and social costs.\Kotnik questions why the council would choose to make its decision using only the financial return on investment when the environmental and social return on investment is much higher, he said.\""I'm flabbergasted that the environmental impacts so well-documented and scientifically supported, how American population can think the scientific method doesn't work for climate change,"" Kotnik said.\Jerry Unruh, a retired chemist who has been a volunteer on the Utilities Electric Integrated Resource Plan committee, said he was disappointed that the consultant's report did not include the cost of the EPA's proposed carbon regulations - also known as the carbon tax. Even if costs cannot be calculated, it should be considered a risk, he said.\""The reality of climate change is that carbon regulations are coming,"" he said. ""Not including that, it does not seem like responsible planning.""\Pico said the environmental and social costs are difficult to quantify. He can only count on the real costs, he said.\""Greenhouse gases is, I adamantly think, completely bogus. I don't give that any weight,"" he said. ""I look at the financial number. I look at the real numbers for which we have to write checks.""\Weise said the council seems to overlook a key point in the consultant's report, which says that because of Drake's age, operating it for 20 to 30 years would not be practical or feasible.\""Drake's age and central urban location present continued high health, safety and financial risks from pollution emissions, fire, chemicals and other conditions inherent in such an industrial operation, and thus should be given the highest consideration in your decommissioning decision making process,"" Weise wrote in her letter to the council.\King said that during his campaign he heard from constituents that keeping Utilities rates low was important to them.\""My goal is to produce electrical energy at the lowest rate and with the air as clean as possible,"" King said. ""If we continue to do that with Drake, I will continue to support a long-term view.""\-\DRAKE OPTIONS\Here are the options that consider financial return on investment compared to sustainable return on investment, starting with the base scenario.\[bullet] Base case -- 20-year Drake operation with Neumann Systems Group's scrubber technology and considering potential new requirements on nitrogen oxides. It would cost about $5.2 billion in capital costs, fixed operating costs, operations and maintenance costs and fuel costs to operate Drake until 2033.\[bullet] Early Drake retirement, by 2019, with new gas generation replacement would cost $242 million more than the base case. However, under sustainable considerations, Utilities would avoid spending $753 million, which is the monetized value of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental and social costs.\[bullet] 15-year Drake operation with Neumann scrubber and potential new requirements on nitrogen oxides and no site remediation would cost $133 million more than base case.

101,"ON JULY 13, IN GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO, a day after the coronavirus pandemic hit a local three-month peak, 45 elderly women flouted the state's ""safer-at-home"" directive and withstood temperatures that reached 105 degrees Fahrenheit to meet at the Grand Vista Hotel for the Mesa County Republican Women's Luncheon.\Officially, the event was meant to spotlight an issue on this year's ballot in Colorado, a contentious measure on wolf reintroduction in the state. But as the women milled about the hotel's conference room, discarding their masks and embracing each other, the scene looked more like a reunion. Although the group, which was founded in 1944, typically gathers monthly in Grand Junction, Mesa County's largest city, the meetings had been on forced hiatus since March, and the women were excited to be together, excited by their shared disobedience.\The featured speaker was Denny Behrens, co-chair of the Colorado Stop the Wolf Coalition, but the true star of the day was Lauren Boebert, a feisty MAGA Republican who had just beaten a longtime incumbent, Rep. Scott Tipton, in the Republican primary. Boebert moved from table to table for introductions, handshakes and hugs, a sidearm holstered at her hip. At 33, she was the youngest there by decades. In Rifle, Colorado, where she has lived since the early 2000s, Boebert owns the Shooters Grill, where waitresses in tight flannel shirts and denim serve burgers and steaks with loaded handguns strapped to their hips or thighs. The Grill was shut down in May for repeatedly violating public health orders restricting in-person dining, but the publicity Boebert received from the conflict - and a GoFundMe petition for the Grill that raised thousands of dollars - assisted her bid for Congress.\After a lunch of barbecued chicken, potato salad and corn muffins, the group's president officially began the meeting. She recited a prayer, quoted Abraham Lincoln, and led the room in the Pledge of Allegiance. Then she introduced key people in the room: candidates for the county commission, a representative from President Donald Trump's Mesa County campaign office, and Boebert.\Speaking to the room, Boebert described a conversation she had had with Trump, who called her after she won. ""President Trump said that he was watching this from the very beginning,"" Boebert said. ""He said, 'I knew that something big was going to happen with you, and now I get to call and congratulate you.' He said, 'Every day I'm fighting these maniacs, but now I have you to fight them with me.'""\Her audience laughed and applauded. Boebert smiled brightly. We are going to win this fight against the liberal socialist agenda and restore the potential for our community to develop our rich natural resources right here in the ground in Mesa County,"" she said.\Boebert is partly right; this election could mean a change in how much fossil fuels are extracted from public lands. Currently, a quarter of the crude oil produced in the United States comes from federal lands, and almost threequarters of Mesa County is federally owned. Public land also accounts for 20% of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions, making it key to any national energy (or climate) policy.\If he wins in November, Trump promises to further his agenda of ""energy dominance,"" which has already opened millions of acres of federal land across the Western U.S. to energy extraction. But if his opponent, Joseph Biden, wins the presidency, he'll bring with him the most progressive environmental platform ever proposed by a major party candidate. And, as with so many issues in this election, the stakes are high for communities that rely on public lands - and nowhere are these themes more amplified than in Grand Junction, the home of the new Bureau of Land Management headquarters.\THERE ARE 1,260 OIL WELL SITES scattered throughout Mesa County. The scene is not apocalyptic; the sites don't dominate the landscape, and the machinery is tucked away from highways and out of view from the city center. In the rural communities that orbit Grand Junction, pumpjacks, compressors and pipes sit amid a mosaic of farms and ranchland, orchards and winery towns, and numerous biking and hiking trails.\Some 63,000 people live in Grand Junction, more than 80% of them white, and around 15% Latino. The city is named for its location at the junction of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers, and has a long history of mining, including uranium. In the 1970s, thousands of homeowners were warned that their homes had been built on non-mediated radioactive sites, marked by gray, sand-like waste from a defunct uranium mill downtown.\Over the last decade, Grand Junction has developed a reputation for outdoor recreation and wineries. It is a city defined by two distinct identities: new liberal-leaning outdoor enthusiasts and a more rooted, conservative population. The different groups coexist amid the expansive public land with all its multiple uses: hunting, fishing, hiking, mountain biking, motorized off-roading and skiing, as well as ranching and the extraction of oil, gas and coal.\There are nearly 20 outdoor gear stores in the downtown vicinity alone, reflecting the myriad approaches to life here. Brochures, maps and pamphlets at places like Hill People Gear - a family-run institution that sells hand-sewn goods and promotes gun rights on its website - and Loki Outdoor gear - where an 18-yearold sales associate told me she was ""definitely"" voting for Biden - tout the many nearby places where one might recreate. About 73% of Mesa County is public land, but only 18% of it is protected from natural resource development. So far, Grand Junction has had enough room for a variety of perspectives and competing interests. Since Trump took office, however, he has offered more land for oil and gas development in his first two years as president than Obama did in his entire second term, auctioning off more than 24 million acres of public lands. If Trump is re-elected and continues to lease land at the rate of the last few years, opponents fear that land that could be managed for recreation, wildlife or conservation will wind up under the control of energy companies. At best, it will remain idle, but be inaccessible to the public. At worst, it will be immediately developed and directly contribute to greenhouse emissions in a world that is already nearing the critical threshold for the climate crisis.\Even as Grand Junction has changed, the Trump years have widened the political and cultural divide between liberals and conservatives here. Multiple use and the concept of space for all have given way to sharpened political ideologies and divisiveness, and attitudes have hardened around the pandemic and its restrictions, while protests have arisen concerning police brutality.\AFTER I LEFT the Republican Women's Luncheon, I drove west to the trailhead of Lunch Loops, a popular mountain biking trail network just outside Colorado National Monument. I was there to meet Sarah Shrader and Scott Braden, two of the town's most prominent conservationists.\Shrader and Braden represent an alternate vision for Grand Junction, a future in which a sustainable economy is built around abundant access to public lands. Both are relative newcomers to the area, but they've invested their personal and professional lives in the Colorado canyon country.\I waited for them by a picnic table in the sweltering heat. Behind me, a rocky mesa hulked over the system of singletrack trails, extending out from narrow ledges and scarcely visible breaks in the canyons - the kind of landscape whose scale outflanks the mind's ability to absorb it.\The area is managed jointly by the Bureau of Land Management and the city of Grand Junction. The local BLM office, with the help of the city and a number of other land-use agencies, is extending a connector trail all the way to the monument. Once it's finished, a person will be able to bike from the heart of downtown Junction all the way to the monument in about 25 minutes.\Soon, Braden arrived and shared some relief: iced black coffee sweetened with agave nectar, which he poured from a glass jar into a tin mug for me. Braden is 44, with a friendly smile and a dark goatee. He has worked for many conservation organizations and served a stint on a resource advisory council for the BLM. Now, he runs his own firm where he provides advocacy-for-hire for Western environmental and conservation groups.\""Grand Junction is really the perfect place to be for me,"" he told me as we drank. ""This is a place with an economic identity built around cattle and sheep, oil and gas, uranium mining. But you look out on places like this, and you see the ability of outdoor rec as an industry to transform it.""\Just then, Shrader drove up, parked, and walked towards us. Shrader is the head of the Outdoor Recreation Coalition, a local interest group she founded in 2015 to help outdoor recreation businesses work together to market the area as an international destination.\The three of us stood on the sandy pavement drinking our coffee, using the picnic table to reinforce social distancing. The trails were empty except for one mountain biker, who was climbing a steep ascent to the edge of the ridge; we watched, half in awe, half concerned that the rider might collapse from heat exhaustion. Shrader thought she recognized the cyclist as a pro she knew. ""I was riding my bike up the monument the other day, and she lapped me going up,"" Shrader said, ""and she lapped me again going down.""\Shrader's cheeks were moist with perspiration above a royal blue bandanna that she pulled down to drink her coffee. She moved from Prescott, Arizona, to Grand Junction in 2004 with her husband. In addition to running the coalition, Shrader owns a company called Bonsai Design, which builds adventure courses - hard-core mountain playgrounds with ziplines, obstacle courses, Indiana Jones-type bridges - for resorts, state parks and adventurerecreation companies. She started it in her basement in 2005, and her business grew quickly. She bought a building downtown, but outgrew that space, too. Just recently, she broke ground on a new location by the Colorado River - part of a revitalization project that features a water park designed to accommodate low-income families and encourage them to recreate on the river.\Shrader said the Outdoor Recreation Coalition was formed to grow adventure-based industries and the higher quality of life that goes with them. ""I did that to really start talking publicly and visibly about the outdoor rec economy here and to shift focus on primarily getting our wealth from the surface of the land, instead of underneath it,"" she said.\Recently, the president of Colorado Mesa University asked Shrader to develop and head a new outdoor rec industry program, which offers students experience and coursework on adventure programming, guide services and the fundamental accounting and finance classes needed to run an outdoor recreation business. This fall is its first semester. Shrader serves as the program's director and also teaches a few classes. ""It came from the demand of so many outdoor industry businesses here saying, 'We need a talented and skilled workforce,' "" she said. ""I really created the program classes to be a reflection of what businesses need and what businesses want.""\She envisions training a new workforce for outdoor-recreation businesses in what has become an $887 billion industry - creating stable, green, good-paying jobs in fields tied to conservation and landscape preservation.\Shrader views the coming election as a crucial moment for Grand Junction. ""When we're talking about the economy, we're talking about creating a quality of life that is bringing people here,"" she told me. ""Location-neutral workers, doctors, manufacturing companies - they don't have to work in the outdoor rec industry, but they're coming here and raising their families here, buying houses, buying commercial property here, paying their employees here because of this"" - she motioned to the rocky mesas surrounding us.\Braden and Shrader worry that Trump's desire to develop more natural resources here could significantly alter the local landscape. ""This place - along with Book Cliffs, Dolores Basin, Grand Mesa, the national monument - is the critical infrastructure of our community, if you're thinking about creating that quality of life,"" Braden said. ""If an oil well and a surface oil truck is one picture of an economy future, this place would be the picture of the other economy future. We have a choice as a community, which one we want to run towards.""\As Shrader drank her iced coffee, Braden continued. ""Grand Junction is an avatar for this choice,"" he said. ""This is a place that, not too long ago, our picture of our economic future was an oil field. Now we have a choice.""\FOR DECADES, the Bureau of Land Management has struggled to disentangle the two contradictory directives that make up its mission: management of the landscape for conservation, and a quota for sustained yield of that landscape's natural resources. Its direction sways back and forth, reflecting the interpretation of the administration currently in charge of the agency's mandate for multiple uses. The idea is that the political appointees who run the agency have a responsibility to take a balanced approach that keeps in mind the public land's many resources - timber, energy, habitat and more - and its various other uses, including recreation, mining and grazing. The BLM's mission, in its own words, is to balance these at-odds uses ""for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations.""\But ever since the BLM was formed in 1946 by President Harry Truman, to act as the guardian of the public lands, it has served as more of a purveyor than a preserver of land, water and minerals. It was established to administer grazing and mineral rights, and it largely benefited ranching interests, officially combining the General Land Office and the U.S. Grazing Service - both of which aided in the exploitative conquest of the Western United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\The agency has never found its balance. In 1996, President Bill Clinton made history by designating the 1.7 millionacre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah, the first national monument to be overseen by the BLM. Then, under George W. Bush, millions of acres of public land were leased for oil and gas drilling and logging, and ""Drill, baby, drill!"" became a 2008 Republican campaign slogan. Barack Obama's tenure over Western public lands was marked by the implementation of policies meant to rein in extraction and focus on preservation. The result was a record of compromise and small gains: He delisted 29 recovered species, but weakened the Endangered Species Act; he designated over two dozen national monuments, more than any other president, but left other important public lands unprotected; he promoted tribal sovereignty, but failed to address systemic inequalities in Indian Country. And even though Obama is considered the first leader to seriously address climate change, he also oversaw surges in oil and gas production.\Neil Kornze, who served as BLM director under Obama, told me that the agency acted as crucial connective tissue in addressing climate change. ""As we think about climate solutions and the way that plants and animals are reacting to these really strong changes in our environment, the BLM becomes the bridge to other areas of refuge,"" he said. ""Questions about sustainable use and conservation are going to be really, really important for the next administration.""\But while the Obama administration's policies were aimed at protecting more public lands from energy development, the rollout of those regulations was difficult for Bureau of Land Management field offices across the West. Jim Cagney, the BLM's former Northwest district manager, based in Grand Junction, told me that the administration was too ambitious, and it overreached. Effective land management, he said, happens over decades, not over the course of a single administration.\""I don't want to burst any environmentalist bubbles or anything, but those guys were really calling the shots from up above,"" Cagney said. ""My feeling at that time was that we can't take on this many battles and win them. We're going to get more pushback than we can handle. Can we slow down and bring this along at a sustainable pace? The Obama administration would have none of that.""\Cagney, who worked for the BLM for three decades, retired before Trump became president. ""It's plainly obvious that (the Trump administration's) public-lands approach is rooted in the denial of any science that conflicts with their extractive agenda,"" Cagney said. ""I've spent my lifetime trying to maintain a balanced, unbiased approach to public lands. I think both parties overplay their hand, and the ever-increasing pendulum swings associated with administration changes are making management of the public lands unaffordable and impractical.""\SINCE HIS INAUGURATION in 2017, Trump has worked hard to undo Obama's legacy, especially when it comes to the environment. I interviewed more than a dozen former Interior Department employees, BLM directors and staff, conservationists, environmentalists and Washington insiders, and by most accounts, Trump has narrowed the vision of the beleaguered agency far more than any of his predecessors. ""Energy dominance is not the same thing as multiple use,"" Nada Culver, vice president of public lands and senior policy counsel for the National Audubon Society, told me. ""It's a very, very radical tug on the balancing act. There is a thumb on the scale.""\Back in October 2016, I attended a campaign rally for thencandidate Trump on the tarmac of the Grand Junction airport. Ten thousand people waited more than four hours outside the arena. The scene was rowdy, joyous, like an energized fan base at a music festival. Although public lands account for nearly three-quarters of the land inside Mesa County's limits, a place known as the gateway to the canyonlands and the home of Colorado's first national monument, Trump never mentioned them explicitly. But he knew that energy development would resonate with his constituency. ""We're going to unleash American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas, clean coal,"" he told the crowd. ""That means getting rid of job-killing regulations that are unnecessary. ... We're going to put the miners right here in Colorado back to work.\""We are going to dominate,"" he said, as his audience whistled and whooped.\Trump won Mesa County by 64% - 28 points more than Clinton. And so began what critics call his ""frontal assault"" on regulation and public-lands protections, and a chaotic remaking of the Bureau of Land Management. Just one week into his presidency, in his second executive order, Trump took aim at the National Environmental Policy Act - the bedrock environmental legislation that safeguards public land and resources for future generations by requiring thorough environmental impact analyses - and ordered expedited environmental reviews for highpriority infrastructure projects. A few months later, Trump ordered public-land agencies to remove regulatory burdens that blocked projects to develop the ""nation's vast energy resources,"" giving agencies 45 days to review ongoing projects.\According to an analysis by The New York Times, in the past few years, Trump has reversed 68 environmental rules; more than 30 similar rollbacks are currently in progress. Many of these moves impact the BLM. In April 2017, Trump signed an executive order to review all designations under the Antiquities Act; later that year, he shrank the boundaries of both Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears national monuments. In December 2017, he scrapped a rule that required mines to prove that they could reclaim their mines; a month later, he ordered Interior to expedite rural broadband projects on public lands. Trump has exempted pipelines that cross international borders, such as the Keystone XL project, from environmental review. In April 2019, he lifted an Obama-era moratorium on new coal leases on public lands; that summer, he nixed a ban on drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\Under Trump's watch, the Interior Department has moved the Bureau of Land Management headquarters from Washington, D.C., where the agency had ready access to decision-makers and politicians, to Grand Junction. The controversial relocation has been criticized as a blatant attempt to deliberately shed institutional knowledge and talent. Since the announcement, the agency has lost half of the staff who were slated for relocation. The department defends the move, citing cost savings and claiming it will be better able to meet its mission by placing ""leadership closer to the resource and lands that BLM manages."" The Government Accountability Office, however, has determined that Interior officials lied about the reasons for the move. Cagney, the former Northwest District manager, sees the relocation as a way to dismantle the agency outright - ""an attempt to divide and conquer and disband the agency and remove it from the power center of decision-making,"" he told me.\Trump has also refused to hire a BLM director. Instead, he selected William Perry Pendley, a controversial conservative with a history of lobbying to transfer public lands to local private interests, to serve as acting director in 2019. Trump sidestepped the nomination process altogether until this June, when he formally nominated Pendley to lead the agency in an official capacity. After months of outrage and opposition - notably from vulnerable Western politicians like Colorado's Republican senator, Cory Gardner, who is up for re-election this year - Trump withdrew the nomination. But Pendley still serves as acting director, working out of the new headquarters in Grand Junction. Conservation organizations are lobbying to have him fired outright, though that appears unlikely to happen before November's election.\By most accounts, Trump has been successful in advancing his agenda of energy dominance. Though American energy production set records during Obama's tenure, according to the Interior Department, the revenue from federal oil and gas output in 2019 was nearly $12 billion - double that produced during Obama's last year in office. The courts - and the uncertain economic situation - have acted to temper abrupt change, but Trump has done everything in his power to clear the way for development.\""Four more years of Trump means a steady stream of oil and gas lease sales and locking in leases and fossil fuel emissions when we can't afford it,"" Kate Kelly, public-lands director for the Center for American Progress, an advocacy organization for progressive policies, told me. ""We will continue to see every acre that could potentially be leased, leased, and the hollowing out of the agencies that are there to protect these landscapes.""\In late summer, Trump revealed one of his most extreme changes yet: Amid the widespread economic crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic, his administration finalized a ""top-to-bottom overhaul"" of NEPA. Trump's change would fast-track infrastructure and result in shorter reviews and a narrower comment process, thereby limiting what the public is allowed to scrutinize. Already, 17 environmental groups have sued. ""(NEPA) is a tool of democracy, a tool for the people,"" Kym Hunter, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, the firm representing the groups, wrote in the suit. ""We're not going to stand idly by while the Trump administration eviscerates it.""\And Trump has promised to continue what he started if he's re-elected in November. He remains skeptical of climate change, calling the crisis a ""makebelieve problem,"" a ""big scam"" and a ""Chinese hoax."" In countering Trump on the issue, Biden has been able to make his most compelling argument for the presidency yet: ""There's no more consequential challenge that we must meet in the next decade than the onrushing climate crisis,"" he said at a virtual town hall in July. ""Left unchecked, it is literally an existential threat to the planet and our very survival. That's not up for dispute, Mr. President. When Mr. Trump thinks of climate change, the only word he can muster is 'hoax.' When I think about climate change, the word I think of is 'jobs' - green jobs and a green future.""\Right now, and for the foreseeable future, the public lands are the battleground for the climate crisis. The United States is the world's largest emitter of fossil fuels after China, meaning that the country must play an outsized role to curb the climate crisis. In order to keep rising temperatures within the critical 2 degrees Celsius threshold that scientists deem necessary to prevent the worst environmental impacts, the U.S. must decrease its total emissions by 25% by 2025. We are not on track to meet this benchmark, but reducing the 20% of emissions that occur on public lands would significantly help the nation to limit catastrophic ripple effects from the worsening crisis. The fight between Biden and Trump is really a fight over keeping fossil fuels in the ground.\IN LATE OCTOBER 2019, Joe Biden traveled to Raleigh, North Carolina, for a campaign rally. There, he encountered Lily Levin, an 18-year-old climate activist with the Sunrise Movement, an international coalition of more than 10,000 young people fighting for immediate action on climate change and skyrocketing inequality. ""I'm Lily from Sunrise,"" she said as Biden turned around to face her. ""I'm terrified for our future. Since you've reversed and are now taking super PAC money - ""\Biden held up a phone, pointed it toward himself and Levin, and took a selfie, as Levin continued: ""How can we trust that you're not fighting for the people profiting off climate change?""\""Look at my record, child,"" Biden responded.\A few days earlier, Levin had learned that Biden was walking back an earlier promise that his campaign would not accept dark money from super PACS - interest groups that influence politics without regulations to require disclosures of the identities of their donors. ""This lack of transparency is a problem, because young people simply cannot trust that politicians - who have kicked the can down the road for decades when it comes to climate change - will be on our side, unless we also know that they're not taking a single dollar from the merchants of our planet's destruction,"" Levin wrote in an op-ed for BuzzFeedNews a few days after the encounter.\Biden has struggled to capture the support of the progressive arm of the Democratic constituency, and his exchange with Levin deepened the doubts of the Sunrise Movement, which, since its creation in 2017, has become an influential force in Democratic politics. The group was an early champion of the Green New Deal, which was initially mocked by politicians, including Nancy Pelosi, as being overly ambitious and impractical. By 2019, however, 16 of the Democrats running for president had endorsed it. Biden was not among them.\In the few years since its founding, the Sunrise Movement has grown from a small group of progressive young people - its oldest leader is 33 years old - to a highly visible organization that draws thousands of volunteers and members across the country. The group's stamp of approval has become perhaps the single most important hurdle to clear for Democratic candidates, and Biden has stumbled in his efforts to achieve it.\Biden, who has been in politics for 47 years, has a checkered environmental record, as Levin likely knew, and has long been considered a moderate on energy. Throughout his years as a senator and his tenure in the Obama administration, Biden has always aimed for the middle ground on climate policies, espousing a diversified energy portfolio that keeps ""bridge fuels"" such as natural gas. As recently as this August, Biden assured some constituents that fracking would continue under his administration - although he has stated that he would not allow it on public lands.\When Biden released his initial climate plan in June 2019, it fell far below what youth climate activists demanded, focusing more on market-driven changes rather than federal mandates to limit emissions. It shied away from a carbon tax, for example, instead favoring policies that finance emission-cutting efforts by the private sector. That December, the Sunrise Movement gave Biden an ""F"" rating, deriding his plan for its lack of specificity and saying it fell far short of promises made by other presidential candidates, such as Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Polls from the time showed that Biden lost more than threequarters of voters younger than 45. ""We don't have to beat around the bush,"" one Sunrise member said. ""Young people ain't voting for Joe Biden.""\But in the months following the primaries, Biden abandoned his moderation in favor of a bolder, more progressive climate stance, largely as a result of pressure from the Sunrise Movement. In late July, Biden released a radically progressive, $2 trillion climate plan, the most ambitious blueprint ever released by a major party nominee and the culmination of months of collaborating with members of the Sunrise Movement.\Just days after releasing his plan, Biden held a virtual fundraiser. ""I want young climate activists, young people everywhere, to know: I see you,"" he said. ""I hear you. I understand the urgency, and together we can get this done.""\In his plan, Biden calls for the complete elimination of carbon pollution by 2035. He also promises to rejoin the international Paris climate accord, which Trump withdrew the U.S. from in 2017. While Trump continues to dismiss the science behind climate change, Biden's plan uses climate science and the projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a foundation. Biden's plan will focus on investing in renewable energy development and creating incentives for industry to invest in energy-efficient cars, homes and commercial buildings. Biden has pledged to end new oil, gas and coal leases on public land and has said he will emphasize more solar and wind energy projects on BLM land.\Despite their initial reservations, many environmental organizations and climate activists have been won over by Biden's new approach. In August, the Sierra Club officially endorsed him. The Sunrise Movement, which agonized publicly over the choice, said that though it would not formally endorse Biden - the group has an endorsement process with specific benchmarks, including requiring candidates to sign a ""no fossil-fuel money pledge,"" in which lawmakers promise not to accept money from PACs or from donors in the extractive energy sector - it would campaign for him. ""What I've seen in the last six to eight weeks is a pretty big transition in upping his ambition and centering environmental justice, Varshini Prakash, co-founder and executive director of the group, told the Washington Post.\In August, Biden named Kamala Harris as his running mate - a signal to his constituency that she would bring accountability to the promises he has made regarding climate action. Harris, who has a strong record of environmental action, made it a centerpiece of her own failed run for the presidency. She and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive congresswoman from New York, introduced the Climate Equity Act, which would establish an executive team and an Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability to police the impacts of environmental legislation on low-income and communities of color. Harris has also said that she wants to eliminate the filibuster - which is a tool most often used for hyperpartisan gridlock - in order to clear the way for the passage of the Green New Deal, a progressive package that aims to mitigate the worse impacts of climate change while transforming the U.S. economy toward equity, employment and justice in the country's workforce.\If Biden is elected, his nomination to lead the Interior Department and the Bureau of Land Management will have great significance for his climate agenda. Potential nominees include Rep. Raúl Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona and the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee; Ken Salazar, Obama's Interior secretary; and John Podesta, a lifelong Democratic operator and former chief of staff under Obama, who is credited with envisioning that era's most memorable conservation and environmental achievements, such as the Climate Action Plan and an economic recovery bill that invested $90 billion in renewable energy and energy efficiency.\Biden has signaled that he'd name a preservation-minded Interior secretary. When Trump withdrew William Perry Pendley's nomination, Biden responded on Twitter. ""William Perry Pendley has no business working at BLM and I'm happy to see his nomination to lead it withdrawn,"" Biden wrote. ""In a Biden administration, folks who spend their careers selling off public lands won't get anywhere near being tapped to protect them.""\FOLDED NEATLY on the countertop that divides Tye Hess's kitchen from his living room was a large navy flag decorated with stars and a bright red stripe and the declaration: TRUMP 2020, NO MORE BULLSHIT. It was a sunny afternoon in July in Redlands, a suburb of Grand Junction. The streets and culs-de-sac in Hess' neighborhood are named after the local wine scene; Hess lives on Bordeaux Court.\""How many flags have you sold this week?"" I asked. He exhaled loudly. ""Quite a few, probably like 20,"" he said.\Hess has short brown hair, bright blue eyes and a small gap between his teeth. He was wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt and casually sipped a ruby grapefruit White Claw as we spoke.\""On Friday, I'm getting much more in, and I'm just going to start handing them out to people saying that if they want to donate to buy more, they can,"" he told me. ""I feel guilty, ya know?"" He laughed. ""It's just something I believe in, so I don't feel like charging for them. I've made plenty of money off these, and I can afford to give some away. But if somebody wants to donate money to buy another one, I'll do that. Just keep it going.""\Hess typically sells the flags for $25. When I met him, he had already sold more than 200, handdelivering each one, and setting up the deals through social media. Previously, he worked for a coal mine, overseeing methane flaring outside of Paonia, Colorado, and then working as an independent contractor, installing granite countertops, carpet and tile. He supplements his income by running his own e-commerce store. He views his flags project as a personal campaign trail. ""We have to do everything we can to get him re-elected,"" he said. Hess, who is 42, only registered to vote a few months before we met, and this election will be his first.\We were waiting for a customer named Eric Farr, who was picking up today's flag. Hess threw away the White Claw, opened his refrigerator, and grabbed a Coors Light. The doorbell rang.\Farr seemed surprised to see me, even though Hess had told him a reporter would be at the handoff. ""You're not some super liberal lady who is going to spin everything I say, are you?"" he asked. I promised him that I wouldn't. ""OK,"" he said.\Farr was born in the mid-1980s at St. Mary's Medical Center, in Grand Junction. He grew up riding a Yamaha YZ125 motorbike, honing a talent and a love for motocross on the dips and yaws of the town's bluffs, managed for motorized use by the BLM. He had traveled widely, competing professionally on his Yamaha and sponsored by Jägermeister. ""I have been all over the world, but never wanted to live anywhere else,"" he told me. ""I just want to keep the public lands open, like the BLM area. It's just free and open space. I just want to keep a lot of it open for the motorcycles and side-by-sides.""\As we talked about the land, I asked Farr what he thought of Trump's refusal to fill the position of director at the BLM. ""With everything going on, I haven't seen anything about (Trump's) approach to public lands,"" Farr replied, referring to the pandemic and the ongoing demonstrations for Black lives. ""It seems like Trump is about letting the states do what they feel is best with their public lands. So I think he's got enough on his plate that he doesn't really have time. As important as public lands are, there are a million other things that are just as important that he's focused on.""\I asked whether Farr was worried about future generations being able to mountain bike, e-bike and dirt-bike the rocky plateaus and canyons, the same lands that have been such a large part of his own life.\""I get real upset when people dump their trash out there, because that's going to get them shut down quicker than anything probably,"" he said. He thought Trump was the country's best hope for a return to aspects of his childhood he values: ""constitutional values,"" he said, ""what the founding fathers tried to instill into our country."" He told me that he wants his children - he has two children under 7 and a baby on the way - to experience the same freedom that he feels he grew up with. ""I'm not a Democrat, I'm not a Republican,"" Farr told me. ""I'm a patriot. Trump is like our savior basically. He's our only hope.""\""Yep, I just barely registered (to vote) because of Trump and seeing these idiots,"" Hess said, referring to the social justice activists protesting in Grand Junction following the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. ""I've had plenty of disagreements, and I never seen such rude comments (on social media). Then you fight back and they play the victim.""\Hess took another Coors out of the refrigerator and handed it to Farr. ""It's just ignorance and - like you said - victim mentality,"" Farr said to Hess, taking the beer.\I tried to steer the conversation back to the Interior Department, but they wanted to focus on what they called the gall of the ""radical socialist left."" Though both Hess and Farr's lives have been intimately connected to the public lands in the Grand Junction area, the fate of those landscapes has not factored into their calculus for November's election.\About a week later, a lightning bolt 18 miles north of Grand Junction ignited the Pine Gulch Fire, a blaze that became the largest wildfire in Colorado's history. By early September, it had burned around 140,000 acres, mostly on BLM land. It pushed northwest, forcing evacuations for residents who live next to abandoned wells in the town of De Beque, down the road from Rifle, the home of Shooters Grill.\For weeks, Grand Junction was shrouded in wildfire smoke. Since we first talked, Hess and his fiancée had moved to the rural edges of the county. From Hess' home, he could barely make out the rows of peach trees just beyond his property line under the dense sepia-toned sky. In a photo he sent me, the sun burned an electric scarlet; he told me he was worried for the wildlife.\I imagined what someone standing in the new headquarters of the BLM might be able to see. When I visited the office in July, the sky was bright blue and clear, with mere scraps of clouds offering a respite from the heat. From its north-facing windows, you could see the Grand Valley Off-Highway Vehicle Area, where Farr loves to ride. To the southeast was the place known as Lunch Loops, the mountain biking area that Shrader can pedal to in just minutes from her front door, and the entrance to Colorado National Monument.\Due to the pandemic, most employees were telecommuting, and very few people were there, save for a few construction workers fixing electrical issues on the third floor. They were from Shaw Construction, one of the BLM's neighbors in the building. The BLM also shares the building with Chevron, the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, Laramie Energy and ProStar Geocorp, a mapping company. In the middle of a move, the BLM headquarters was a scene in flux, a place still trying to realize itself.\Along the halls of the BLM's office, large murals of iconic scenery - Colorado National Monument, Black Canyon of the Gunnison - leaned against bare walls, waiting to be hung. I remembered talking to Hess about his city as a new nexus for public-lands management, and asking him what he thought about moving the BLM headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Grand Junction. Hess just laughed: ""The BLM headquarters is here?"" #"
102,"
Starting last May, a small group of radical climate activists, mostly from Salt Lake City, spent five months camped on the East Tavaputs Plateau, a jumble of conifer-choked canyons and broad sandstone and shale ridges in eastern Utah commonly known as the Book Cliffs. In the beginning, they adhered closely to Bureau of Land Management rules: They moved camp every 14 days, packing up tents, sleeping bags and camp chairs; the makeshift toilet, nicknamed ""dirty Herbert"" after Utah's governor; and a hanging sweater rack repurposed into a lending library, which included literature by Toni Morrison and Louise Erdrich along with nonfiction on oil, imperialism and anti-coal activism. Flies found them quickly at many new spots, and they'd spend a couple of insufferable days swatting thin air. Then, the bugs seemed to dissipate, perhaps thanks to bats.
\
As the months wore on, their diligence about relocating exactly on time faltered slightly. But in theory, it was important to do so, and generally to keep everything about camp aboveboard, because the things they did outside of camp weren't always, and they didn't need additional scrutiny.
\
The activists called their camp a ""permanent protest vigil,"" its purpose to monitor and impede construction of what could become the first tar sands mine in the U.S. They have stood in front of and locked themselves to heavy machinery. Once, they dressed up as chipmunks and chased road graders around a construction site. At least one woman trespassed regularly into the mine's test pit, to see if there was anything worrisome worth documenting.
\
The September weekend that I dropped in, the activists were hosting a special campout to encourage locals to ""connect with the land."" After a long drive on winding backroads, I found the camp on the shoulder of a sweeping ridge, hidden among a stand of pine and fir. Tents pincushioned the forest floor on either side of a slim spur crammed with cars and pickups and ending in a tight turnaround - a cul-de-sac in the woods. The days I was there, activists wore jeans, T-shirts, fleece, clogs and hiking boots. People read books around the fire-pit, and lounged in the kitchen, an elaborately tarped affair with a spice rack and serving buffet. They slept in, brewed endless pots of coffee, and told camp tales: of encounters with bears, hikes gone awry, epic meals prepared and eaten (one involved cashew cream sauce). It felt pretty laid-back for a hotbed of radicals intent on revolution. Then again, it was the weekend.
\
On Saturday morning, with the wind calm and temperature pleasantly climbing, I joined the ""morning circle"" - around 15 people, sitting in camp chairs or on five-gallon buckets or in the dirt around smoldering coals. Each person introduced themself, and gave their preferred gender pronoun - he, she or they - which everyone was asked to respect. Vigil stalwart Raphael Cordray, who once owned a gift shop for radicals in Salt Lake, volunteered to lead a tour of the test pit. Chad Hamblin, a high school science teacher, offered to lead a nature hike. Kathy Albury, a member of the environmental ministry at Salt Lake's Unitarian Church, wanted to march on Sunday, the same day demonstrators would clog Manhattan for the People's Climate March. Rachel Carter, also from the Salt Lake area, agreed: ""These sources of extraction are where people should be marching,"" she said, and suggested a hashtag: #comeherenextyear.
\
Then it was on to explaining ""camp norms,"" which were scrawled in colored marker on a cardboard sign hanging from the food trailer: Don't talk to the cops; no racism, sexism, transphobia or other forms of bigotry; no violence of any kind. Also, ""no pants at the fire pit"" - code for no cell phones, which could be tapped by police, the FBI, or other Big Brothers. Welcome to the resistance.
\
I FIRST HEARD OF THE VIGIL in July 2014, after reading a newspaper story about one of its rowdier moments. It came after a weeklong campout, when 80 or so people came to the Book Cliffs to learn about community organizing, nonviolent direct action and ""climate justice"" - the idea that climate change solutions must alleviate the social and environmental burdens our energy economy disproportionately imposes on the world's poorest, usually non-white, people.
\
Before dawn on July 21, a group of activists had made their way to a fenced lot where U.S. Oil Sands, the mine's developer, kept its heavy machinery. Their goal: to stop construction for the day. Though sheriff's deputies were camped out there, a few activists slipped in and locked themselves to the equipment. Around 20 others linked arms and stood or sat outside the fence, blocking the road. By the end of the day, deputies had carted 21 people off to the Uintah County jail.
\
Reading about it brought me back to a crowded theater in Paonia, Colorado, where in 2013 I watched the documentary Bidder 70. It tells the story of Tim DeChristopher, a University of Utah student who, in 2008, made bids at a BLM oil and gas lease sale, driving up prices and winning 14 parcels he did not plan to drill, worth $1.8 million he could not pay. DeChristopher spent 21 months in federal prison, becoming a minor folk hero in the process.
\
I remember being impressed by DeChristopher's eloquence and unbending adherence to his principles. He deliberately broke the law to keep the oil and gas in the ground - to prevent the greater crime of more carbon pollution, he said - and refused a plea bargain. But there was something disquieting about his story and the images of his comrades storming the Interior Department in Washington and getting arrested; weeping outside the Salt Lake courthouse after his sentencing, sitting in the street, refusing to move, getting arrested. Climate change stirred something in him - in them - that it had yet to stir in me. Anger, maybe? Passion? I wasn't sure. But it was an emotion I didn't recognize in myself, or in most of my friends.
\
Which left me feeling conflicted. I'm an environmental journalist, well informed on climate change. I write stories about the science, which keeps getting worse, and the policy, which keeps standing still. I write about irrevocable changes to the mountains and deserts I love, and about how drought and heat could render some of them uninhabitable. I know the climate crisis is big and bad. And yet I don't get angry about it, not really angry. Neither do most of my well-informed and idealistic friends. But shouldn't we?
\
Reading about the U.S. Oil Sands lock-in, and remembering DeChristopher's story, made me curious about what was brewing in the Book Cliffs. Did these people know something I didn't? More to the point, did they feel something I didn't?
\
AFTER SATURDAY'S MORNING CIRCLE, I piled into a big white van with seven others to tour the mine's test pit, a few minutes down Seep Ridge Road, which was in the process of being widened and paved for future industrial traffic. At the pit, vegetation had been cleared, a berm cut into the ridge, and a hole dug, exposing brown, gray and ebony rock layers. Rainwater had created a pond the color of dark tea, where Raphael Cordray said she had seen cows drinking. She suspected it was toxic.
\
The tour was for outsiders (mainly me) and visitors from the nearby Uinta Basin who opposed the mine but came up only occasionally. There was Stagg, who goes by one name only, along with David Bell and Lori Savage. They all lived around Roosevelt, Utah, population around 7,000, some 90 miles away. Hamblin, the science teacher, also from the Roosevelt area, was up for his third campout and brought his dad. He was excited to meet like-minded neighbors; environmentalists are few in the Uinta Basin, home to Utah's top oil and gas producing counties. Still fewer are those willing to speak out against energy development. ""It feels like the Lone Ranger out there sometimes,"" he lamented.
\
U.S. Oil Sands, a Canadian company, had secured permits and leases on state trust land, leaving environmentalists without legal leverage to stop it. Now, the company was clearing a building site for a processing facility, aiming to begin commercial production in 2015. CEO Cameron Todd told me the company respects the activists' right to voice their opposition, but that their tactics sometimes crossed the line and posed safety risks. He said his company is willing to engage anyone interested in figuring out better ways to do things, but added, ""There's not much of a dialogue (you can have) with people who just don't want things to happen.""
\
The construction activity was at the building site, but there were actual tar sands to see at the test pit. A future mine was easier to imagine here. On the south.facing, slope below the pit, thick, jet-black ^SMftfMffêUng drip patterns like coagulating blood, with the dry, oppressive smell of fresh asphalt.
\
As others scrambled downslope to check out erosion and fossils, Hamblin and I lingered on the rim. A tall, solid man with a full beard and lively eyes, Hamblin had an encyclopedic knowledge of plants and animals. Zeal for nature burst from his lips like light from a sparkler. He snapped photos, calling out that he had casting equipment if anyone found animal tracks.
\
The night before, he'd sported a ""Bidder 70"" baseball cap - a nod to the DeChristopher film. Like some others, DeChristopher was part of the reason he was here. In 2011, he spent a weekend camping around Dinosaur National Monument, where he ran into an acquaintance who said that his camping spot would have become a ""big oil well"" if not for DeChristopher. That inspired him to later drive two-and-a-half hours to Salt Lake to see the movie, which is where he met some of the activists and learned about the tar sands development.
\
Hamblin bemoaned what he saw as the loss of public-land access to energy development. He recalled a university lecture about permafrost thawing: ""I was the only member of the public who came,"" he said. ""It was like, 'Wow, she's saying a lot of what's going on is not reversible.' I like to cross-country ski, and climate change is making it so there's less snow and more rain. I'm concerned on a lot of levels.""
\
Soon, we climbed back in the van, and bumped down the road to see the scar of a failed 1980s mine. I asked why they called the camp a ""vigil."" Lionel Trepanier, cofounder with Cordray of Utah Tar Sands Resistance, one group behind the protest, explained that ""vigils"" were considered by courts to be constitutionally protected free speech. ""Although there are tents and a kitchen, this isn't camping,"" he said. ""The vigil is the presence.""
\
""So is it like being a witness?"" Hamblin asked. Yes, several people replied.
\
""If we're here and witnessing what's going on, then we'll know other ways to respond,"" Corday said, adding that their presence draws attention to the little-known mine. ""And it creates a place people can come and learn about the issues. It's a safe place if they want to show their discomfort and not be arrested.""
\
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE willing - even eager - to risk arrest trying to stop fossil fuel developments is still small. But it seemed notable to me that they existed at all.
\
The same month Tim DeChristopher went to prison, in 2011, 1,200 were arrested in Washington, D.C., protesting the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry Canadian tar sands to Gulf Coast refineries. Keystone helped galvanize the national climate movement, thanks to organized opposition from the tribes, ranchers and farmers whose land it would cross, and from prominent activists like former NASA scientist James Hansen. Protests small and large, in Washington and elsewhere, have followed the 2011 demonstration. Getting at tar sands and making the oil takes a massive amount of energy, making the fuel hugely carbon intensive. ""If Canada proceeds, and we do nothing,"" Hansen wrote in The New York Times in 2012, ""it will be game over for the climate.""
\
But there are mini-Keystones all over - smaller pieces of less politically and environmentally significant infrastructure that are the foundation for a rush on fossil fuels right here at home, including tar sands. Grassroots activists have taken notice, loudly opposing developments of all sizes and consequence.
\
In Massachusetts, a coalition aims to stop all new fossil fuel infrastructure, including three gas-fired power plants and one pipeline expansion. Massachusetts activists were among those who blockaded the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's offices for a week in the fall. More than 100 were arrested in D.C. and related protests, according to organizers. A Michigan man was recently given a suspended two-month jail sentence and one year of probation after being convicted of a felony for skateboarding inside an unfinished pipeline and refusing to leave. In upstate New York, locals have blocked the entrance to a gas storage facility since October, protesting a FERC-approved expansion. At press time, 170 had been arrested.
\
My question was not whether the activists in Utah or these other incidents were right, wrong or somewhere in between, or whether in each case their tactics were justified or strategic. I wanted to know what motivated them. Civil disobedience involves some level of personal risk, and people wouldn't engage in it, I assumed, without feeling a powerful emotional involvement; the kind of intellectual response many of us have to the climate crisis is simply not enough.
\
""Be as frank as possible,"" an editor at High Country News advised before I began reporting. ""They're not like regular people. They're not just saints. They have a certain personality.""
\
""NATURE WALK DEPARTING!"" crowed a few not-just-saints in unison, standing by the campfire, lit despite Saturday evening's lingering warmth. Hamblin led a group down a trail and into a stand of Doug-fir, piñón and juniper, carrying a shepherd's crook in one hand, a camera carabineered to his shirt. He wondered aloud if finding threatened or endangered plants might help stop the mine.
\
We lingered on a southerly slope, under a haggard old piñón, its roots snaking out from the tan soil as though coming up for air. Among them, we discovered an antiion, an insect whose predatory larvae bury themselves in sand, awaiting prey. We poked its pit with a twig, which it attacked, provoking oohs! and more pokes.
\
I wandered back uphill to camp with Rachel Carter, a dedicated member of Fteaceful Uprising, a Salt Lake climate justice group sponsoring the vigil. It was co-founded by DeChristopher after the BLM auction and has continued working locally, though he moved out of state to attend Harvard Divinity School. Carter wore .a shaggy pixie cut and army-green pants. Wblack T-shirt with its cut-off sleeves proclaimed: ""I Am The Carbon Tax.""
\
Though Carter didn't spend all season here, she frequently delivered food that Salt Lake supporters donated and foraged from suburban grocery dumpsters, and joined for special campouts. I asked her why she joined Peaceful Uprising and was surprised to learn she was relatively new to environmentalism and radical activism, if not unfamiliar with it. Her Mormon parents were members of the ultra-conservative John Birch Society, which fought communism and the civil rights movement in the 1950s and '60s. She joined at 15 and was raised believing Joseph McCarthy was a hero. But as she grew older, she became uncomfortable with her family's politics. She moved to Seattle and ""was liberalized but not activated,"" as she struggled to sort out her feelings on Mormonism. ""My approach for a long time was just no involvement with anything,"" she said.
\
In 2008, she moved back to Utah, right after Proposition 8, which sought to ban same-sex marriage, passed in California with hefty support from the Mormon Church. Carter, who had left the church, was incensed that it had entered politics ""in a way that fucked a lot of people over."" A rare protest was held outside the Salt Lake Mormon Temple just before she moved home. Then DeChristopher went to the BLM auction. ""There was a lot happening, and it was exciting,"" she told me. ""There's something about being an under- dog that engages me. Democrats beings an underdog in Utah, I was interested in P trying to help change that.""
\
She volunteered with LGBT advocacy groups and worked with the Utah Democratic Party. In 2010, she got involved with people in Peaceful Uprising after DeChristopher posted an ad on Craigslist seeking a ""courageous congressperson"" for Utah's 2nd District. He and his cohort were fed up with conservative Utah Democrat Jim Matheson, who had voted against health-care reform and cap-andtrade. So they decided to ""hire"" his replacement. ""Must have solid moral values and a resistance to selling out to corporate interests,"" the ad said. Job responsibilities included ""stopping catastrophic climate change"" and ""ending imperialistic wars of aggression.""
\
At a local library, Carter watched while select ""applicants"" answered questions. That night, a candidate was chosen. ""There wasn't a ton of overhead and bullshit and bureaucracy,"" she said. ""And it was just a lot of fun."" She worked on the campaign (it failed after forcing Matheson into a runoff), and about six months later, helped prepare for DeChristopher's trial.
\
'The climate end of it was not one of my main reasons for getting involved with Peaceful Uprising,"" she said, as we stood on the edge of camp. ""It was more about the culture of the group and what they were creating. It was a really creative, energetic group of people.""
\
I heard a similar story from Jesse Eruhwirth, a member of Peaceful Uprising and vigil keeper, who was among the 26 in court this month. In early 2011, he was a reporter for City Weekly, Salt Lake's alternative paper, covering criminal justice, homelessness, DeChristopher's trial, and a 2011 effort by the Utah Legislature to gut open-records laws. It was the first time his editors allowed him to ""throw objectivity to the wind and be blatantly biased toward open access,"" he told me in a phone interview. ""I felt like in real life I was a polarizing firebrand, but that journalism snuffed that out. Not everyone has that, and I feel like it's the best thing I've got.""
\
By the spring of 2011, though, Fruhwirth was feeling burnt out, and thought his body was showing signs of stress. Once, when someone hugged him, he said, it broke a rib. He quit and bought a vegan hot dog stand in downtown Salt Lake. But though he'd gotten a taste for polemics, he wasn't sure how to satisfy it. He thought a lot of activism lacked a winning strategy. When a friend dropped by the hot dog stand to tell him about planning meetings for Occupy Salt Lake, late in the summer of 2011, he remembers mentally rolling his eyes. But once the Occupy encampment was established, in early October, he stopped by. He was surprised to see a homeless woman he knew from his reporter days running the welcome booth. ""It didn't match my stereotype of what an activist was,"" he said. ""I was very inspired to see homeless people acting politically with non-homeless people."" He joined the camp.
\
Occupy Salt Lake lasted a little more than a month before the city police dismantled it. Both Fruhwirth and Carter were arrested during the eviction. Some activists returned to their day jobs, Fruhwirth said, ""but some of us joined the revolution and never looked back."" He found Peaceful Uprising one of the few refuges for the newly radicalized in Salt Lake. Climate change was not his top priority, but neither did these seem like typical environmentalists. ""I'd heard Tim DeChristopher question capitalism,"" he told me. ""Hearing an environmentalist talk about capitalism was not quite as awesome as seeing a homeless person running the welcome booth at Occupy, but it was one of those moments.""
\
Peaceful Uprising members told me their goal at present is to stop ""extreme energy extraction"" on the Colorado Plateau. Grassroots activists across the country are converging on a similar aim: No new infrastructure for the extraction, transportation or burning of fossil fuels. ""Not here, not in Fort McMurray, not in Mobile, Alabama,"" Lauren Wood, an early Peaceful Uprising member who just left the group, told me. ""Not fracking, not oil, none of it."" It's a tall order; stopping even one Utah mine will be tough unless tumbling oil prices change things for the company. Yet the activists' ultimate goal is even more ambitious: to end growthat-all-costs capitalism and oppression in all forms - to fundamentally restructure the entire economic and social order.
\
""Of course it's too big,"" DeChristopher told me, when I reached him by phone and inquired about the grassroots movement's ambitions. ""If we're going to create any kind of change, it's going to have to come from a mass movement. And to effectively mobilize people you need a big vision,"" he said. ""Every successful social movement in our history has been unrealistic. Even people who were anti-slavery thought abolitionists were completely nuts. There had literally always been slavery until it was banned. Why not aim for something we actually want? Why not aim for the kind of world we want to see?""
\
On Saturday night back in the Book Cliffs, I crawled into my tent and opened The Monkey Wrench Gang. I'd brought it with me, guessing that Abbey's environmental call-to-arms had helped inspired the activists. If so, it never came up.
\
LATE SUNDAY MORNING, under a pocket of blue sky, some 30 people climbed out of vehicles onto Seep Ridge Road. One man wore a colorful clown mask; another played ""This Land is Our Land"" on a saxophone. A brown-and-white teacup of a dog scampered about, its fur ruffled by a whiplashing wind.
\
A couple of people unfurled a banner - ""Together and Everywhere We Rise Up for Climate Justice"" - and the group marched toward the test pit. The banner was a nod to the People's Climate March, now underway in New York, where hundreds of thousands jammed the streets in an event Politico described as ""a comingout party for a new, breed of environmentalism - one that is louder and lowdier than the old-school greens.""
\
The Utah activists hoped the New York march would accomplish something but were disappointed with its tame approach. It was planned in cooperation with the police and did not confront any specific threats. They were more jazzed about Flood Wall Street, a more aggressive, unpermitted sit-in planned for the following day. Its slogan: ""Stop capitalism. End the climate crisis.""
\
Here, though, things were pretty tame, too. When the marchers arrived at the test pit, about half of them scrambled through an opening in the fence, past ""no trespassing"" signs, some with bandanas or scarves pulled up like bandit masks. They stood beside the pit's brown pond and posed for pictures. The clown climbed atop a pile of excavated rock and thrust a ""No Tar Sands"" sign in the air. Others stayed on the legal side of the fence, either not interested in breaking the law, or seeing little value in it in this instance. The cops never appeared; I was the only reporter. There was scarcely anyone out here to witness it. Nevertheless, the protesters were here to say ""no"" to the mine because, as a white-haired woman from Moab named Dorothy put it: ""These days, if you're not saying 'no,' you're saying Ves.' ""
\
I DROVE HOME AFTER THE MARCH, where on and off for the next couple months, I tried to figure out exactly what I had learned about the climate activits and about myself.
\
I was surprised by how little they resembled the environmentalists I usually interviewed. There was little talk of the finer points of renewable energy policy, little time spent lamenting the death of trees, or the troubles of pikas and polar bears. But immigration reform came up. The legacy of colonization for Native peoples came up. Capitalism and its sins came up - a lot.
\
Radicals, more than one person told me, try to attack the roots of problems. The word ""radical,"" they said, means ""going to the origin."" And the members of Peaceful Uprising have come to believe that the root cause of climate change and other massive problems, like income inequality, is the profit-hungry capitalist system we're all part of, and especially the people at the top of it.
\
""This isn't just about C02 in the atmosphere and parts per million,"" Carter told me. ""The various oppressions that have led up to this have been going on for centuries. All of these things are feeding the same system of overlapping and selfreinforcing problems."" To Carter and her comrades, climate change represents the last, worst example of the unjust relationship between rich and poor, white and black, colonist and Native. ""The refugee crisis we're going to be seeing will affect the most marginalized. Wars - that is real.""
\
I got some of what they were saying about the climate fight being not just about the environment, but a web of ""intersecting oppressions."" I understood that poor communities of color had long shouldered an unfair share of pollution, and that climate change promised to punch them hardest again. But was the climate fight really of a piece with the immigration fight? The struggle against police brutality? The connections weren't always obvious, and in any case, was it possible or practical to take on everything that was wrong with the world at once?
\
Then, on a December evening, after wrestling with writer's block in my Santa Fe office, I tackled what seemed like a more manageable task: applying for health insurance through the new marketplace. I'd left my staff job at High Country News about seven months earlier, to see if I could make it independently. My husband, a potter, had also recently started his own business. I typed in our unimpressive income, and up popped our options. The cheapest plan would cost around $225 a month. If we had a baby, a brochure informed me, it would cover $1,240 of average delivery costs, and we'd pay $6,300. This was insurance, new and improved? None of it was affordable. None of it. As I drove home, I cried alone in my car, then a little more in my kitchen. I felt ashamed. And then I got pissed.
\
The healthcare law had been carefully designed to win support from private insurance companies, but it still resulted in crappy options that squeezed scrappy people like us. It was hardly surprising, but it didn't seem fair. Then it occurred to me that maybe in that moment, I was angry about climate change, too. My basic complaints about the healthcare reform sounded pretty similar to the critique the activists I spoke with made about the failed 2010 federal climate bill: It tweaked a broken system at its edges, appeasing polluters for political viability rather than proposing the kind of changes the crisis actually demanded. It was a false solution, people told me, and many didn't care that it failed. I thought about their argument about ""root causes,"" and recognized twinges of their anger in myself.
\
A lot of things started converging in my mind: Occupy. The fast food workers' ""Fight for $15."" The outrage and despair over the killings by police of Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and Eric Gamer. All had one thing in common: the sense that our society is designed to work for some and not for others, with the balance tipping ever more in favor of those who need the least help. When I applied for health insurance, I felt something similar: The deck was stacked, against me.
\
The New York Times recently ran a story about the fight for $15 an hour, profiling one of the campaign's leaders, Terrance Wise, a father of three who worked at both Burger King and Pizza Hut and still had trouble paying rent and utility bills. When he asked his manager at Pizza Hut for a raise, she showed him the pay policy, saying she could boost his pay at most 25 cents after three years, even though he made less than $8 an hour. ""If I gave you 25 cents,"" he recalled being told, ""that means you're perfect.""

""It makes me angry, and you should be angry, that these billion-dollar corporations are robbing from my kids and your kids,"" Wise said in the story. ""So we're going to have to stand up and fight back."" It was the same sentiment I'd heard in the Book Cliffs. People wanted a society with a little more humanity, one whose outcomes are less determined by corporations that serve only their shareholders, valuing profits above the stability of the atmosphere or the dignity of their workers.
\
When I first arrived at the vigil, I imagined the activists as agitators on the fringe of the environmental movement. They saw themselves, instead, as one twitchy muscle in a much broader and building unrest. I was starting to see them that way, too.
\
Be as frank as possible. They're not like regular people. That may be true, but these are not regular times.

Three cheers for Thomas Friedman, whose recent Op-Ed (""From Putin, A Blessing In Disguise"" -- New York Times, March 19, 2014) proposes a new ""space-race/moon-shot"" Grand Bargain for clean energy!
\
Regarding the developing Cold War-style dynamic with Putin's Russia, Friedman writes: ""If we're going to go at it again, this time I want an Earth Race. I want America to lead in developing an energy policy that will weaken the oil-and-gas-autocracy of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and, as a byproduct, produce the technologies that will mitigate climate change, make America a global technology and moral leader and ensure that the next generation can thrive here on Earth.""
\
I'm not particularly a Friedman fan, but this suggestion is inspired. Imagine the possibilities: The Russians are defeated -- a second time! -- without firing a shot; The gridlock on energy and climate change is finally broken; President Obama earns a hero's legacy in foreign policy, economic policy, and the new energy future; The country's spirit is united and renewed; And we save the world. Such a deal!
\
As in any Grand Bargain, there are things for all the players to like: One side gets approval of the Keystone pipeline and, in the short term, freedom to extract U.S. oil and gas resources as well as freedom to export them to global markets. In exchange the other side gets strict regulation on extraction to protect the environment and eliminate methane leakage, a national clean energy standard for electricity which mandates rising renewable sourcing, sharply increased funding for clean power technology research, and a revenue neutral tax on carbon emissions.
\
Of course what one side likes the other side really dislikes. Friedman hates the Keystone pipeline. So do I. It is wrong in about six different ways. Tar sands mining destroys the landscape, runs roughshod over Native American rights, wastes tremendous amounts of water steaming the junk out of the rocks, and expends almost as much energy as it gains. The pipeline idea adds the probability of multiple disastrous leaks and spills, despoiling ecosystems and neighborhoods. It also offers phony benefits regarding jobs (temporary) and lowered U.S. gas prices -- from the refineries it will go to the highest bidders worldwide, just like oil from any other source.
\
Most critically damning of all, building the pipeline and extracting the goo is a telling choice: It says there is no stopping our insane addiction to ""cheap"" fossil-fuel-derived energy. This is precisely why Keystone has become a symbol and a line in the sand for so many of us who are seriously concerned about climate change. The choice to pump and burn every last drop, chunk, and smear of carbon fuel means ""game over,"" in the words of climate science expert James Hansen. If we don't leave much of it in the ground, we will be confronted with runaway feedback effects that humans will be powerless to reverse or defend against. The climate in which humans evolved will be over, changed for the worse in ways fatal and scarcely imagined.
\
But if Keystone's real importance is as a symbol -- and it is -- then it would be wise to let it be a symbol of the turning point in which a smart bargain was made to finally turn our energy path in a new direction. Is this climate change heresy, or a last-chance hope?
\
Likewise, the new fracking-enhanced American gas and oil boom is environmentally foolhardy for many of the same reasons. And it too is game over for preventing irreversible climate change -- unless it is a short term chip in a larger game. A pragmatic view would suggest that we aren't going to be successful in stopping this latest extraction wave anytime soon anyway, but if we could get something really game-changing in return....
\
The prospects of such a Grand Bargain also depend on what the other side really dislikes, and what influence might be brought to bear to encourage acceptance anyway. Clearly the fossil fuel industry has no intention of leaving any burnable carbon in the ground. Their financial calculus is that reserves are like buried pots of gold. Any negative consequences are discounted and externalized so presto -- they disappear from the equation.
\
And of course those who deny the reality of human-caused climate change would see no point. Why fix what isn't broken? How might they be persuaded? Maybe fear-mongering from the Department of Defense and the insurance industry about the perils of ignoring the risks. Maybe shaming for being ignorantly anti-science. Maybe cool reasoning about the economic benefits in jobs and incomes that can be proven to accrue in a green economy. Maybe a trip to Beijing for a week of breathing carbon-clogged air. Or perhaps the patriotic appeal of getting the best of Putin and winning another cold war. Whatever it takes, it's worth the effort isn't it?
\
American ingenuity, competition, and national pride could succeed where all else fails. A Grand Bargain: heresy, or hope for solving climate change?

Remarks of President Barack Obama - As Prepared for DeliveryState of the Union Address""An America Built to Last""Tuesday, January 24th, 2012Washington, DCMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:Last month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq. Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought - and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world. For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. Most of al Qaeda's top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home.These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness, and teamwork of America's Armed Forces. At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They're not consumed with personal ambition. They don't obsess over their differences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together. Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example. Think about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world in educating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we're in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren't so tied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded. We can do this. I know we can, because we've done it before. At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known. My grandfather, a veteran of Patton's Army, got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth. The two of them shared the optimism of a Nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism. They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share - the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement. The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. What's at stake are not Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. We have to reclaim them. Let's remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren't, and personal debt that kept piling up.In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn't afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people's money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn't have the authority to stop the bad behavior.It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs. And we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect. Those are the facts. But so are these. In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we've agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we've put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like that never happens again. The state of our Union is getting stronger. And we've come too far to turn back now. As long as I'm President, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place. No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last - an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values.This blueprint begins with American manufacturing.On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world's number one automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs. We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back. What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. We can't bring back every job that's left our shores. But right now, it's getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in fifteen years, Master Lock's unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back. But we have to seize it. Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed. We should start with our tax code. Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it. So let's change it. First, if you're a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn't get a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home.Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here. Third, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. If you're a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making products here. And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.My message is simple. It's time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I'll sign them right away. We're also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years. With the bipartisan trade agreements I signed into law, we are on track to meet that goal - ahead of schedule. Soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago. I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products. And I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules. We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration - and it's made a difference. Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires. But we need to do more. It's not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized.Tonight, I'm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China. There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing finance or new markets like Russia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you - America will always win.I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can't find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that - openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work. That's inexcusable. And we know how to fix it. Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College. The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training. It paid Jackie's tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant.I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train two million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job. My Administration has already lined up more companies that want to help. Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, Orlando, and Louisville are up and running. Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers - places that teach people skills that local businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing. And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help they need. It's time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work. These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier.For less than one percent of what our Nation spends on education each year, we've convinced nearly every State in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning - the first time that's happened in a generation. But challenges remain. And we know how to solve them.At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced States to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies - just to make a difference. Teachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let's offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. In return, grant schools flexibility: To teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren't helping kids learn.We also know that when students aren't allowed to walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. So tonight, I call on every State to require that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn eighteen.When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves middle-class families thousands of dollars. And give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years.Of course, it's not enough for us to increase student aid. We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll run out of money. States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who've done just that. Some schools re-design courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better technology. The point is, it's possible. So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education can't be a luxury - it's an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.Let's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: The fact that they aren't yet American citizens. Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else. That doesn't make sense. I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration. That's why my Administration has put more boots on the border than ever before. That's why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office. The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let's at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, and defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away.You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women should earn equal pay for equal work. It means we should support everyone who's willing to work; and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs. After all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses. So let's pass an agenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year. Innovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally-financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched. New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet. Don't gut these investments in our budget. Don't let other countries win the race for the future. Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries. Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy. Over the last three years, we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I'm directing my Administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now, American oil production is the highest that it's been in eight years. That's right - eight years. Not only that - last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years.But with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, oil isn't enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy - a strategy that's cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs. We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly one hundred years, and my Administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I'm requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of thirty years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock - reminding us that Government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground. What's true for natural gas is true for clean energy. In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries. Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled. And thousands of Americans have jobs because of it. When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance. But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it's hiring workers like Bryan, who said, ""I'm proud to be working in the industry of the future.""Our experience with shale gas shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don't always come right away. Some technologies don't pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here. We have subsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough. It's time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's rarely been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that's never been more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits and create these jobs. We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change. But there's no reason why Congress shouldn't at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven't acted. Well tonight, I will. I'm directing my Administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power three million homes. And I'm proud to announce that the Department of Defense, the world's
largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history - with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year.Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So here's another proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, and more jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that creates these jobs. Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America's infrastructure. So much of America needs to be rebuilt. We've got crumbling roads and bridges. A power grid that wastes too much energy. An incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world. During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our States with a system of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today.In the next few weeks, I will sign an Executive Order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to fund these projects. Take the money we're no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home.There's never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest-hit when the housing bubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren't the only ones hurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who've seen their home values decline. And while Government can't fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief. That's why I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates. No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won't add to the deficit, and will give banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a Government and a financial system that do the same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody. We've all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn't afford them. That's why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior. Rules to prevent financial fraud, or toxic dumping, or faulty medical devices, don't destroy the free market. They make the free market work better. There is no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly. In fact, I've approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. I've ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don't make sense. We've already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next five years. We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill - because milk was somehow classified as an oil. With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk. I'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder. But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago. I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury pollution, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean. I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny you coverage, or charge women differently from men. And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules. The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system's core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, start a business, or send a kid to college.So if you're a big bank or financial institution, you are no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers' deposits. You're required to write out a ""living will"" that details exactly how you'll pay the bills if you fail - because the rest of us aren't bailing you out ever again. And if you're a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they can't afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices are over. Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job: To look out for them. We will also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people's investments. Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there's no real penalty for being a repeat offender. That's bad for consumers, and it's bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing. So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count. And tonight, I am asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans. A return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help us protect our people and our economy. But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future.Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile. People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year. There are plenty of ways to get this done. So let's agree right here, right now: No side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut without delay. When it comes to the deficit, we've already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means making choices. Right now, we're poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else - like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans? Because if we're serious about paying down our debt, we can't do both. The American people know what the right choice is. So do I. As I told the Speaker this summer, I'm prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors. But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of Members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes. Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule: If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes. And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires. In fact, if you're earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn't get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn't go up. You're the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. You're the ones who need relief. Now, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense. We don't begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it. When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich. It's because they understand that when I get tax breaks I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference - like a senior on a fixed income; or a student trying to get through school; or a family trying to make ends meet. That's not right. Americans know it's not right. They know that this generation's success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to their country's future, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility. That's how we'll reduce our deficit. That's an America built to last. I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt; energy and health care. But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right now: Nothing will get done this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken. Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical? The greatest blow to confidence in our economy last year didn't come from events beyond our control. It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not. Who benefited from that fiasco? I've talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street. But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad - and it seems to get worse every year.Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics. So together, let's take some steps to fix that. Send me a bill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress, and I will sign it tomorrow. Let's limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact. Let's make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can't lobby Congress, and vice versa - an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington. Some of what's broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days. A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything - even routine business - passed through the Senate. Neither party has been blameless in these tactics. Now both parties should put an end to it. For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days.The executive branch also needs to change. Too often, it's inefficient, outdated and remote. That's why I've asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy so that our Government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people. Finally, none of these reforms can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town. We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common sense ideas. I'm a Democrat. But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That Government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more. That's why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and States. That's why we're getting rid of regulations that don't work. That's why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a Government program. On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about Government spending have supported federally-financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home. The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective Government. And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress. With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow. But I can do a whole lot more with your help. Because when we act together, there is nothing the United States of America can't achieve. That is the lesson we've learned from our actions abroad over the last few years.Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies. From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can't escape the reach of the United States of America.From this position of strength, we've begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Ten thousand of our troops have come home. Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer. This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America.As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana'a to Tripoli. A year ago, Qadhafi was one of the world's longest-serving dictators - a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he is gone. And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change can't be reversed, and that human dignity can't be denied.How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain. But we have a huge stake in the outcome. And while it is ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well. We will stand against violence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings - men and women; Christians, Muslims, and Jews. We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.And we will safeguard America's own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests. Look at Iran. Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran's nuclear program now stands as one. The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent. Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe. Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever. Our ties to the Americas are deeper. Our iron-clad commitment to Israel's security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history. We've made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope. From the coalitions we've built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we've led against hunger and disease; from the blows we've dealt to our enemies; to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back. Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about. That's not the message we get from leaders around the world, all of whom are eager to work with us. That's not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin; from Cape Town to Rio; where opinions of America are higher than they've been in years. Yes, the world is changing; no, we can't control every event. But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs - and as long as I'm President, I intend to keep it that way. That's why, working with our military leaders, I have proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I have already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing danger of cyber-threats.Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it. As they come home, we must serve them as well as they served us. That includes giving them the care and benefits they have earned - which is why we've increased annual VA spending every year I've been President. And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our Nation.With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we are providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets. Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families. And tonight, I'm proposing a Veterans Job Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her.Which brings me back to where I began. Those of us who've been sent here to serve can learn from the service of our troops. When you put on that uniform, it doesn't matter if you're black or white; Asian or Latino; conservative or liberal; rich or poor; gay or straight. When you're marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails. When you're in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one Nation, leaving no one behind.One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden. On it are each of their names. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But that doesn't matter. Just like it didn't matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates - a man who was George Bush's defense secretary; and Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for president. All that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about politics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn't deserve credit for the mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job - the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs. More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other - because you can't charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there's someone behind you, watching your back.So it is with America. Each time I look at that flag, I'm reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those fifty stars and those thirteen stripes. No one built this country on their own. This Nation is great because we built it together. This Nation is great because we worked as a team. This Nation is great because we get each other's backs. And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard. As long as we're joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong.Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.

""Pretty much any business can benefit.""\To learn more about the program, the groups will host a free interactive webinar from 9 to 9:30 a.m. Jan. 30. As incentive, one attendee will receive suite-level tickets to a show of their choice at the 1stBank Center this year.\Shelby Sommer, with Brendle Group, said the group is still waiting on 2018 figures to see how many Broomfield businesses have participated, but data through mid-year showed 103 businesses took advantage of the various Demand Side Management (DSM) programs through Xcel Energy.\The Brendle Group is an engineering and planning firm focused on helping clients solve complex problems while creating lasting impacts for sustainability.\Of those, 50 participated in small business lighting improvements and rebates and 37 participated in lighting efficiency rebates.\Mendoza said she would like to see 365 energy actions logged by the end of June.\Cost savings depends on the business type and are based on the types of improvements made.\Xcel Energy partners with more than 30 communities in Colorado and Minnesota to offer these types of rebates.\Each community comes up with its own action plan, Sommer said, either focusing on residential engagement, business or municipal facilities.\""Broomfield was exclusively interested in business outreach and engagement,"" she said. ""We've been working with the Broomfield Chamber and economic development folks out there.""\John Dobie, owner of BSC Signs, had Xcel conduct an energy audit about nine months to a year ago, which immediately detected some ""low-hanging fruit.""\In the company's 20,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, they replaced old fluorescent lighting with LED lights. The effect has been notified, and appreciated, by employees.\""It just makes you feel more optimists working in a bright environment versus a dim environment,"" he said. ""It's hard to put a financial value on that, but if it makes people feel better about working in a company, I'm all for it.""\The audit showed air leaks from the compressors used for power tools and to spray paint products, he said, and probably the largest difference BSC made was converting four manual thermostats to Nest thermostats that are computer controlled.\By fixing all of those issues, he said he is seeing about $500 a month in energy savings.\""It's really significant,"" Dobie said about the $6,000 a year savings.\Since making these adjustments employees are more conscious of their energy consumption and do little things, like turning off lights when they leave a room, to be more contentious.\He recommends the program to other businesses looking to take steps toward efficiency.\""It's very measurable,"" he said. ""We look at electricity bills over the last couple of years, and look at the last six months, and it's not 'we think we've saved money.' It's 'we have saved money.'""\Dobie estimates the company will have paid for the improvements after about 24 months.\Leanne Holitza, owner of The Healing Studio, said in 2018 the company fixed the garage door so it seals for better heat control, and put a heater and new lights in the garage. In 2015 she added a low-maintenance/water landscaping and added a wireless thermostat.\Jennifer Rios: 303-473-1361, riosj@broomfieldenterprise.com or Twitter.com/Jennifer_Rios\\Credit: By Jennifer Rios, Staff Writer"
106,"After their swearing-in next Tuesday, six new members of the Colorado Spring City Council should quickly scrutinize a bad decision made this week at the last meeting of the current council.\In a weird move to create an appearance of environmental stewardship, the Colorado Springs City Council -- which doubles as the board of directors for Colorado Springs Utilities -- voted 6-3 in favor of spending tens of millions of dollars on solar gardens. The first phase alone will cost ratepayers $750,000 a year for the next 20 years.\Two phases that will add more solar capacity in 2014 and 2015 will add hundreds of thousands more in annual expenses for the next 20 years if the Council/Utilities Board chooses to fund them.\This debacle could cost ratepayers up to $30 million. The three who voted against it -- Tim Leigh, Angela Dougan and Lisa Czelatdko -- are outgoing members of the council/Utilities board.\The Gazette's editorial board fully supports efficient use of energy and environmental measures that make good sense. We're all for Utilities paying financial incentives that encourage ratepayers to procure more efficient light fixtures, appliances, insulation and energy-efficient windows.\These subsidies -- known by utilities professionals as ""demand-side management"" -- reduce consumption at such a rate the utility quickly recoups its money. Everyone wins, along with the local economy.\If solar panels generated enough power to make them a cost-effective option, we would get behind the solar gardens decision. They do not. Solar panels are so inefficient the entire solar industry has, throughout most of its existence, consumed more energy than its panels have produced. Only this month did a Stanford University study find that solar panels may have finally begun harnessing slightly more energy than is consumed in building, deploying and maintaining them. The industry is a long way from genuinely helping the environment or creating bargain kilowatts for society.\This much we know as indisputable fact. Colorado Springs Utilities generates electricity at 2.6-cents per kilowatt hour. The solar panels Council just committed to generate electricity at 16-cents per kilowatt hour. The balance -- 13.4 cents per kilowatt hour -- is pure cost to ratepayers who may or may not view solar as a potential aid to the environment.\So, the council's decision takes tens of millions of dollars out of play that could otherwise be used on serious environmental stewardship. It is money that could pay for insulation, LEDs, better refrigerators and all the other green measures that actually do more good than harm.\Unlike environmental subsidies, Utilities cannot possibly recoup its investment into solar panels that generate power so inefficiently.\The primary champion of the solar garden debacle is outgoing council member Brandy Williams, who claims this program might woo young, affluent business people to town.\If that were true, it wouldn't be a bad idea. But it's probably not true. We think young professionals are smart enough to know a horrendously bad investment when they see one. We also doubt the premise that inefficient solar panels are so fashionable as to weigh heavily on a person's decision to live and work in Colorado Springs. Williams might do better asking City Hall to subsidize sushi.\What most likely brings young, affluent professionals to any city is this: JOBS.\The decision to splurge on solar may actually reduce jobs. Estimates place the annual cost to average residential consumers at something roughly the same as a latte at Starbucks. That's not inconsequential when factored over the population of Colorado Springs. Hundreds of thousands of coffee drinks amount to substantial money local coffee shops could use to hire dozens more baristas.\And not all who buy electricity are small residential users. Some large companies will see their annual electrical costs go up by as much as $17,000 as a direct result of the solar decision.\Atmel ranks among Utilities' largest customers. Atmel executive Dan Malinaric told council members that the solar program will hurt his business. A few months ago, Malinaric explained, the company laid off 200 employees because of the weak economy. Thousands in higher electrical costs will mean Atmel and other employers have even less cash with which to pay employees.\City leaders will not move our city forward with foolhardy decisions like this, made at an expense of the hard-earned wages and profits of residents and businesses. The new council should try to fix it."
107,"
I strongly support Boulder's development of a municipally-owned and operated system for delivering electricity. Here's why:
\
Munis work, control is local. Twenty-five percent of the electricity distributed in this country is via municipally-owned utilities and rural-electric coops. Costs are lower, and reliability of delivery is higher than with investor-owned utilities like Xcel, whose stockholders expect a good return. I trust Boulder's leadership and staff to represent the interests of the people and our fragile planet. Further, I worry about how Xcel would be regulated if a right-wing governor were elected and appointed climate change deniers to the Public Utility Commission.
\
Running a business Some favor keeping IOUs in charge of minis because ""they know more about business than do municipalities."" However, running an IOU is importantly different from running a conventional business where efficient business practices are critical elements in achieving a healthy bottom line.
\
Often, inefficient business practices yield greater profits for IOUs. In exchange for gaining an exclusive franchise to provide energy, the Public Utility Commission allows for utilities to make a ""reasonable"" rate of return on equity -- typically 10 to 12 percent -- based on their costs for labor, generation and distribution facilities, fuel, and services like demand-side management. Accordingly, the larger the cost of operations, the larger the absolute profit an IOU can make (from ratepayers, of course.)
\
Thus, utility companies like Xcel have dozens of senior officers and managers whose salaries are huge even by modern corporate standards. Further, once a given power plant is paid for, often there are economic benefits to invest in yet another, even if by conventional business economics it would be foolhardy.
\
A Boulder muni could be run much more efficiently. No need for corporate jets, dozens of over-paid vice presidents and an outsized legal staff. Instead, the muni would be driven by agendas such as customer service, energy efficiency, reliance on renewables and environmental excellence -- quite different from a corporation managed with profit-making as the primary aim.
\
Breakthrough technology Accessing free solar energy locally and turning it into useful light, heat and electricity elegantly is now breakthrough technology that runs deep. Both wind and solar are suddenly much less costly than is fossil-fuel-based power generation. Coupled with energy-and-cost efficient designs that can store electricity at high densities, the combination represents a quantum leap for building systems (new and retrofit, first world and third), transportation, communications and related development. An excellent presentation on breakthrough technologies may be streamed at youtube.com/watch?v=Kxryv2XrnqM .
\
The death of coal Coal is the primary fuel Xcel's power plants use to generate electricity. Presently, most major coal companies are already bankrupt, with outgo outstripping income by millions of dollars per week.
\
Accordingly, IOUs are facing the reality that coal suppliers are going out of business -- and what coal is available is increasingly expensive. So many IOUs like Xcel will soon have large ""stranded assets"" like coal-fueled generation plants that cost billions. Costs will be passed on to ratepayers, so if Boulder continues to ally itself with Xcel, the city's customers will pay the price. Meanwhile, the environment will continue to suffer since Xcel will likely keep their big coal plants running as long as possible.
\
Xcel realizes that electricity generation with solar and wind have become cheaper than with fossil fuels. Accordingly, they are enthusiastic about these renewables, but only if they own large fields of renewable generating facilities themselves. So Excel now has strong interests in making rooftop solar (indeed, any solar owned by others) less economically attractive by raising the fixed costs of being connected to the grid as high as possible as soon as possible.
\
Boulder's opportunity Xcel has massive amounts of outdated equipment and a complex business model that operates under a ponderous regulatory structure. Run as a real business with a sharp focus on efficiency, a Boulder muni can be lean, nimble and quick to adopt appropriate technologies to supply customers with a variety of innovative and useful services.
\
Imagine Boulder's smart grid with aggressive time-of-use pricing that features low night-time rates. This will spur electric vehicle adoption while balancing the grid's load profile. (Wind energy peaks on winter nights, just as solar peaks on hot summer days.) Smaller, locally self-reliant solar and wind powered micro-grids hold great promise for local economic development, environmental improvement, and overall reliability.
\
The choice is between an ancient, lightening-damaged oak that has outlived its usefulness and a willow that can bend. A Boulder muni should hop to it with great vigor and creative energy.

108,"Colorado Springs Fire Chief Chris Riley and Colorado Springs Utilities CEO Jerry Forte speak at a news conference\Read more at http://gazette.com/martin-drake-power-plant-fire-determined-accidental/multimedia/video/3544194428001#FDVU5EmZc7HOAJUi.99\Video: Colorado Springs Fire Chief Chris Riley and Colorado Springs Utilities CEO Jerry Forte speak at a recent news conference. Video by Andrea Sinclair.\-\Environmental activist Leslie Weise is amazed that the Colorado Springs City Council will not consider closing Martin Drake Power Plant in the next five years.\It was, after all, among 12 scenarios outlined in a half-million-dollar consultant's report for the council to consider in its deliberations over when to decommission the downtown coal-fired plant. It also was the scenario that had the best combined financial and environmental outcomes, she said.\This month's fire inside the Drake plant highlighted the risks of running an aging coal-fired plant in the middle of downtown, Weise said. Cheap power comes at the high price of health, safety and the environment, she said.\Weise, a Monument attorney whose clients have clean energy and sustainability missions, is seeking support in the Colorado Springs business community to pressure the council to reconsider a short-term life for the 52-year-old power plant.\About a dozen business leaders have joined the cause by signing a letter, which likely will be presented to the council, in its role as the Colorado Springs Utilities Board, at its meeting Wednesday.\""There is a large scope of people besides just environmentalists who question that plant,"" she said.\In March, a majority of the council indicated that closing Drake in the short term - meaning less than six years - is off the discussion table. It would not be enough time to plan for life post-Drake, which provides about one-third of the city's power. It would take longer to plan and build a replacement power source, the council members said. Instead, the council will consider a decommissioning date nine to 15 years out, or longer. The council said it would like to make a decision on Drake by the end of summer.\""I was surprised, personally, to see that everyone (on the council) was looking at mid- and long-term dates,"" council member Andy Pico said. ""That is a function of cost associated with near-term closure and what it would cost to replace as well as the investment we already put into it.""\This week, the council will be asked by the Utilities staff to decide how much weight it will put on the social and environmental costs when deciding Drake's fate. In a dozen options presented to the council, a consultant outlined the financial costs of closing Drake in three years on up to 30 years. It also attempted to outline the environmental, social and health costs for each option.\Weise said one of the options the council dismissed would close Drake by 2019 and would save an estimated $753 million in social and environmental costs.\""For them to look at the community with a straight face and say we will ignore the environmental, economic, health and social costs - well, they need to be straight and tell us that,"" said Weise, whose sister, Linda Weise, is executive director of the Colorado Springs Conservatory in downtown Colorado Springs.\But Sean Paige, a former City Council member who recently was a panelist for the El Pomar Foundation's forum on Drake, argues that Drake's decommissioning date should not be arbitrarily set.\Instead, the council should revisit the issue each year, checking on the power plant's performance, market prices and federal regulations, he said.\""We don't know the regulatory landscape in two years; we don't know the market conditions,"" Paige said. ""There is no harm in planning and trying to set deadlines, but realistically, this is something that should be decided as we go along in light of changing circumstances.""\Pico said there is a lesson to learn from the fire at Drake: that it costs twice as much to produce electricity from natural gas as from coal. Since the fire, Drake has been shut down and Utilities has relied on its natural gas-fired power plant and is buying natural gas on the market to produce electricity. It costs about $3 million more a month.\The City Council will be asked May 27 to increase electric rates by about 7 percent for Utilities customers - about $5 a month increase for a typical customer - to cover those costs.\""There is a daily cost that will hit everyone right now,"" Pico said. ""That is the cost of generation of natural gas.""\Drake's three boilers, Nos. 5, 6 and 7, were built in 1962, 1968 and 1974. Early reports are that only unit No. 5 was damaged in the fire, but Utilities officials are assessing the damage and costs to repair.\Meanwhile, cities across the country are shuttering coal plants. More than 30 coal-fired plants have closed in the wake of strict Environmental Protection Agency regulations, including emissions control.\Last year, the Utilities board set up the Drake Task Force to begin discussing when or if the power plant should be shut down. But it had signed contracts for scrubber technology to remove carbon dioxide, one of the pollutants targeted by federal rules.\According to the consultant's report, it would cost about $5.2 billion in capital costs, fixed operating costs, operations and maintenance costs and fuel costs to operate Drake until 2033. Those costs include the installation of scrubber technology.\Closing Drake by 2019, as Weise suggests, would mean shutting down the scrubber project, which is underway and has about 70 percent of the $131 million committed.\Those financial investments are among reasons council President Keith King wants to keep Drake open long term, he said.\""This plant might be very clean and very functional for a longer period once we get (scrubbers) up and running,"" he said.\The 12 options for Drake include the costs of building a replacement power source, adding renewable energy, offering demand side management incentives and adding to the Front Range natural gas plant. The best financial option is to keep Drake open for 30 years, according to the consultant's report. Then, Utilities would see a more than $200 million return on its investment, the report said.\When looking strictly at the financial return on investment, there is not much cost difference among the 12 options, said Cliff Kotnik, a member of the Southeastern Colorado Renewable Energy Society.\But an immediate closure of Drake has more social and environmental benefits including avoiding spending $753 million - the monetized value of the repercussions of greenhouse gas emission and other environmental and social costs.\Kotnik questions why the council would choose to make its decision using only the financial return on investment when the environmental and social return on investment is much higher, he said.\""I'm flabbergasted that the environmental impacts so well-documented and scientifically supported, how American population can think the scientific method doesn't work for climate change,"" Kotnik said.\Jerry Unruh, a retired chemist who has been a volunteer on the Utilities Electric Integrated Resource Plan committee, said he was disappointed that the consultant's report did not include the cost of the EPA's proposed carbon regulations - also known as the carbon tax. Even if costs cannot be calculated, it should be considered a risk, he said.\""The reality of climate change is that carbon regulations are coming,"" he said. ""Not including that, it does not seem like responsible planning.""\Pico said the environmental and social costs are difficult to quantify. He can only count on the real costs, he said.\""Greenhouse gases is, I adamantly think, completely bogus. I don't give that any weight,"" he said. ""I look at the financial number. I look at the real numbers for which we have to write checks.""\Weise said the council seems to overlook a key point in the consultant's report, which says that because of Drake's age, operating it for 20 to 30 years would not be practical or feasible.\""Drake's age and central urban location present continued high health, safety and financial risks from pollution emissions, fire, chemicals and other conditions inherent in such an industrial operation, and thus should be given the highest consideration in your decommissioning decision making process,"" Weise wrote in her letter to the council.\King said that during his campaign he heard from constituents that keeping Utilities rates low was important to them.\""My goal is to produce electrical energy at the lowest rate and with the air as clean as possible,"" King said. ""If we continue to do that with Drake, I will continue to support a long-term view.""\-\DRAKE OPTIONS\Here are the options that consider financial return on investment compared to sustainable return on investment, starting with the base scenario.\[bullet] Base case -- 20-year Drake operation with Neumann Systems Group's scrubber technology and considering potential new requirements on nitrogen oxides. It would cost about $5.2 billion in capital costs, fixed operating costs, operations and maintenance costs and fuel costs to operate Drake until 2033.\[bullet] Early Drake retirement, by 2019, with new gas generation replacement would cost $242 million more than the base case. However, under sustainable considerations, Utilities would avoid spending $753 million, which is the monetized value of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental and social costs.\[bullet] 15-year Drake operation with Neumann scrubber and potential new requirements on nitrogen oxides and no site remediation would cost $133 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities would avoid spending $148 million.\[bullet] 15-year Drake operation with Neumann scrubber technology and potential new requirements on nitrogen oxides with moderate site remediation would cost $135 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities avoids spending $149 million.\[bullet] 15-year Drake operation with Neumann scrubber technology and potential new requirements on nitrogen oxides with high site remediation would cost $138 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities avoids spending $151 million.\[bullet] Nine-year Drake operation with Neumann scrubber would cost $190 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities avoids spending $483 million.\[bullet] 30-year Drake operation with Neumann scrubber technology and potential new requirements on nitrogen oxides has the best financial return on investment of $216 million, compared to the base case. Under sustainable considerations, it would cost $151 million more than base case.\[bullet] Three-year Drake operation -- shutdown upon emissions compliance date, would cost $224 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities would avoid spending $434 million.\[bullet] Nine-year Drake operation with 150 megawatts of wind generation added upon retirement would cost $272 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities avoids spending $562 million.\[bullet] 20-year Drake operation and work to reduce electricity consumption by 4 percent would cost $324 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, it would cost $618 million more than base case.\[bullet] Drake operating on coal until 2022 and on natural gas from 2023 through 2033 would cost $208 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities avoids spending $362 million.\[bullet] Nine-year Drake operation and then replace with the engine generators on Drake site would cost $230 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities avoids spending $449 million.\SOURCE: HDR.

The balance -- 13.4 cents per kilowatt hour -- is pure cost to ratepayers who may or may not view solar as a potential aid to the environment.\So, the council's decision takes tens of millions of dollars out of play that could otherwise be used on serious environmental stewardship. It is money that could pay for insulation, LEDs, better refrigerators and all the other green measures that actually do more good than harm.\Unlike environmental subsidies, Utilities cannot possibly recoup its investment into solar panels that generate power so inefficiently.\The primary champion of the solar garden debacle is outgoing council member Brandy Williams, who claims this program might woo young, affluent business people to town.\If that were true, it wouldn't be a bad idea. But it's probably not true. We think young professionals are smart enough to know a horrendously bad investment when they see one. We also doubt the premise that inefficient solar panels are so fashionable as to weigh heavily on a person's decision to live and work in Colorado Springs. Williams might do better asking City Hall to subsidize sushi.\What most likely brings young, affluent professionals to any city is this: JOBS.\The decision to splurge on solar may actually reduce jobs. Estimates place the annual cost to average residential consumers at something roughly the same as a latte at Starbucks. That's not inconsequential when factored over the population of Colorado Springs. Hundreds of thousands of coffee drinks amount to substantial money local coffee shops could use to hire dozens more baristas.\And not all who buy electricity are small residential users. Some large companies will see their annual electrical costs go up by as much as $17,000 as a direct result of the solar decision.\Atmel ranks among Utilities' largest customers. Atmel executive Dan Malinaric told council members that the solar program will hurt his business. A few months ago, Malinaric explained, the company laid off 200 employees because of the weak economy. Thousands in higher electrical costs will mean Atmel and other employers have even less cash with which to pay employees.\City leaders will not move our city forward with foolhardy decisions like this, made at an expense of the hard-earned wages and profits of residents and businesses. The new council should try to fix it."

I strongly support Boulder's development of a municipally-owned and operated system for delivering electricity. Here's why:
\
Munis work, control is local. Twenty-five percent of the electricity distributed in this country is via municipally-owned utilities and rural-electric coops. Costs are lower, and reliability of delivery is higher than with investor-owned utilities like Xcel, whose stockholders expect a good return. I trust Boulder's leadership and staff to represent the interests of the people and our fragile planet. Further, I worry about how Xcel would be regulated if a right-wing governor were elected and appointed climate change deniers to the Public Utility Commission.
\
Running a business Some favor keeping IOUs in charge of minis because ""they know more about business than do municipalities."" However, running an IOU is importantly different from running a conventional business where efficient business practices are critical elements in achieving a healthy bottom line.
\
Often, inefficient business practices yield greater profits for IOUs. In exchange for gaining an exclusive franchise to provide energy, the Public Utility Commission allows for utilities to make a ""reasonable"" rate of return on equity -- typically 10 to 12 percent -- based on their costs for labor, generation and distribution facilities, fuel, and services like demand-side management. Accordingly, the larger the cost of operations, the larger the absolute profit an IOU can make (from ratepayers, of course.)
\
Thus, utility companies like Xcel have dozens of senior officers and managers whose salaries are huge even by modern corporate standards. Further, once a given power plant is paid for, often there are economic benefits to invest in yet another, even if by conventional business economics it would be foolhardy.
\
A Boulder muni could be run much more efficiently. No need for corporate jets, dozens of over-paid vice presidents and an outsized legal staff. Instead, the muni would be driven by agendas such as customer service, energy efficiency, reliance on renewables and environmental excellence -- quite different from a corporation managed with profit-making as the primary aim.
\
Breakthrough technology Accessing free solar energy locally and turning it into useful light, heat and electricity elegantly is now breakthrough technology that runs deep. Both wind and solar are suddenly much less costly than is fossil-fuel-based power generation. Coupled with energy-and-cost efficient designs that can store electricity at high densities, the combination represents a quantum leap for building systems (new and retrofit, first world and third), transportation, communications and related development. An excellent presentation on breakthrough technologies may be streamed at youtube.com/watch?v=Kxryv2XrnqM .
\
The death of coal Coal is the primary fuel Xcel's power plants use to generate electricity. Presently, most major coal companies are already bankrupt, with outgo outstripping income by millions of dollars per week.
\
Accordingly, IOUs are facing the reality that coal suppliers are going out of business -- and what coal is available is increasingly expensive. So many IOUs like Xcel will soon have large ""stranded assets"" like coal-fueled generation plants that cost billions. Costs will be passed on to ratepayers, so if Boulder continues to ally itself with Xcel, the city's customers will pay the price. Meanwhile, the environment will continue to suffer since Xcel will likely keep their big coal plants running as long as possible.
\
Xcel realizes that electricity generation with solar and wind have become cheaper than with fossil fuels. Accordingly, they are enthusiastic about these renewables, but only if they own large fields of renewable generating facilities themselves. So Excel now has strong interests in making rooftop solar (indeed, any solar owned by others) less economically attractive by raising the fixed costs of being connected to the grid as high as possible as soon as possible.
\
Boulder's opportunity Xcel has massive amounts of outdated equipment and a complex business model that operates under a ponderous regulatory structure. Run as a real business with a sharp focus on efficiency, a Boulder muni can be lean, nimble and quick to adopt appropriate technologies to supply customers with a variety of innovative and useful services.
\
Imagine Boulder's smart grid with aggressive time-of-use pricing that features low night-time rates. This will spur electric vehicle adoption while balancing the grid's load profile. (Wind energy peaks on winter nights, just as solar peaks on hot summer days.) Smaller, locally self-reliant solar and wind powered micro-grids hold great promise for local economic development, environmental improvement, and overall reliability.
\
The choice is between an ancient, lightening-damaged oak that has outlived its usefulness and a willow that can bend. A Boulder muni should hop to it with great vigor and creative energy.

111,"Colorado Springs Fire Chief Chris Riley and Colorado Springs Utilities CEO Jerry Forte speak at a news conference\Read more at http://gazette.com/martin-drake-power-plant-fire-determined-accidental/multimedia/video/3544194428001#FDVU5EmZc7HOAJUi.99\Video: Colorado Springs Fire Chief Chris Riley and Colorado Springs Utilities CEO Jerry Forte speak at a recent news conference. Video by Andrea Sinclair.\-\Environmental activist Leslie Weise is amazed that the Colorado Springs City Council will not consider closing Martin Drake Power Plant in the next five years.\It was, after all, among 12 scenarios outlined in a half-million-dollar consultant's report for the council to consider in its deliberations over when to decommission the downtown coal-fired plant. It also was the scenario that had the best combined financial and environmental outcomes, she said.\This month's fire inside the Drake plant highlighted the risks of running an aging coal-fired plant in the middle of downtown, Weise said. Cheap power comes at the high price of health, safety and the environment, she said.\Weise, a Monument attorney whose clients have clean energy and sustainability missions, is seeking support in the Colorado Springs business community to pressure the council to reconsider a short-term life for the 52-year-old power plant.\About a dozen business leaders have joined the cause by signing a letter, which likely will be presented to the council, in its role as the Colorado Springs Utilities Board, at its meeting Wednesday.\""There is a large scope of people besides just environmentalists who question that plant,"" she said.\In March, a majority of the council indicated that closing Drake in the short term - meaning less than six years - is off the discussion table. It would not be enough time to plan for life post-Drake, which provides about one-third of the city's power. It would take longer to plan and build a replacement power source, the council members said. Instead, the council will consider a decommissioning date nine to 15 years out, or longer. The council said it would like to make a decision on Drake by the end of summer.\""I was surprised, personally, to see that everyone (on the council) was looking at mid- and long-term dates,"" council member Andy Pico said. ""That is a function of cost associated with near-term closure and what it would cost to replace as well as the investment we already put into it.""\This week, the council will be asked by the Utilities staff to decide how much weight it will put on the social and environmental costs when deciding Drake's fate. In a dozen options presented to the council, a consultant outlined the financial costs of closing Drake in three years on up to 30 years. It also attempted to outline the environmental, social and health costs for each option.\Weise said one of the options the council dismissed would close Drake by 2019 and would save an estimated $753 million in social and environmental costs.\""For them to look at the community with a straight face and say we will ignore the environmental, economic, health and social costs - well, they need to be straight and tell us that,"" said Weise, whose sister, Linda Weise, is executive director of the Colorado Springs Conservatory in downtown Colorado Springs.\But Sean Paige, a former City Council member who recently was a panelist for the El Pomar Foundation's forum on Drake, argues that Drake's decommissioning date should not be arbitrarily set.\Instead, the council should revisit the issue each year, checking on the power plant's performance, market prices and federal regulations, he said.\""We don't know the regulatory landscape in two years; we don't know the market conditions,"" Paige said. ""There is no harm in planning and trying to set deadlines, but realistically, this is something that should be decided as we go along in light of changing circumstances.""\Pico said there is a lesson to learn from the fire at Drake: that it costs twice as much to produce electricity from natural gas as from coal. Since the fire, Drake has been shut down and Utilities has relied on its natural gas-fired power plant and is buying natural gas on the market to produce electricity. It costs about $3 million more a month.\The City Council will be asked May 27 to increase electric rates by about 7 percent for Utilities customers - about $5 a month increase for a typical customer - to cover those costs.\""There is a daily cost that will hit everyone right now,"" Pico said. ""That is the cost of generation of natural gas.""\Drake's three boilers, Nos. 5, 6 and 7, were built in 1962, 1968 and 1974. Early reports are that only unit No. 5 was damaged in the fire, but Utilities officials are assessing the damage and costs to repair.\Meanwhile, cities across the country are shuttering coal plants. More than 30 coal-fired plants have closed in the wake of strict Environmental Protection Agency regulations, including emissions control.\Last year, the Utilities board set up the Drake Task Force to begin discussing when or if the power plant should be shut down. But it had signed contracts for scrubber technology to remove carbon dioxide, one of the pollutants targeted by federal rules.\According to the consultant's report, it would cost about $5.2 billion in capital costs, fixed operating costs, operations and maintenance costs and fuel costs to operate Drake until 2033. Those costs include the installation of scrubber technology.\Closing Drake by 2019, as Weise suggests, would mean shutting down the scrubber project, which is underway and has about 70 percent of the $131 million committed.\Those financial investments are among reasons council President Keith King wants to keep Drake open long term, he said.\""This plant might be very clean and very functional for a longer period once we get (scrubbers) up and running,"" he said.\The 12 options for Drake include the costs of building a replacement power source, adding renewable energy, offering demand side management incentives and adding to the Front Range natural gas plant. The best financial option is to keep Drake open for 30 years, according to the consultant's report. Then, Utilities would see a more than $200 million return on its investment, the report said.\When looking strictly at the financial return on investment, there is not much cost difference among the 12 options, said Cliff Kotnik, a member of the Southeastern Colorado Renewable Energy Society.\But an immediate closure of Drake has more social and environmental benefits including avoiding spending $753 million - the monetized value of the repercussions of greenhouse gas emission and other environmental and social costs.\Kotnik questions why the council would choose to make its decision using only the financial return on investment when the environmental and social return on investment is much higher, he said.\""I'm flabbergasted that the environmental impacts so well-documented and scientifically supported, how American population can think the scientific method doesn't work for climate change,"" Kotnik said.\Jerry Unruh, a retired chemist who has been a volunteer on the Utilities Electric Integrated Resource Plan committee, said he was disappointed that the consultant's report did not include the cost of the EPA's proposed carbon regulations - also known as the carbon tax. Even if costs cannot be calculated, it should be considered a risk, he said.\""The reality of climate change is that carbon regulations are coming,"" he said. ""Not including that, it does not seem like responsible planning.""\Pico said the environmental and social costs are difficult to quantify. He can only count on the real costs, he said.\""Greenhouse gases is, I adamantly think, completely bogus. I don't give that any weight,"" he said. ""I look at the financial number. I look at the real numbers for which we have to write checks.""\Weise said the council seems to overlook a key point in the consultant's report, which says that because of Drake's age, operating it for 20 to 30 years would not be practical or feasible.\""Drake's age and central urban location present continued high health, safety and financial risks from pollution emissions, fire, chemicals and other conditions inherent in such an industrial operation, and thus should be given the highest consideration in your decommissioning decision making process,"" Weise wrote in her letter to the council.\King said that during his campaign he heard from constituents that keeping Utilities rates low was important to them.\""My goal is to produce electrical energy at the lowest rate and with the air as clean as possible,"" King said. ""If we continue to do that with Drake, I will continue to support a long-term view.""\-\DRAKE OPTIONS\Here are the options that consider financial return on investment compared to sustainable return on investment, starting with the base scenario.\[bullet] Base case -- 20-year Drake operation with Neumann Systems Group's scrubber technology and considering potential new requirements on nitrogen oxides. It would cost about $5.2 billion in capital costs, fixed operating costs, operations and maintenance costs and fuel costs to operate Drake until 2033.\[bullet] Early Drake retirement, by 2019, with new gas generation replacement would cost $242 million more than the base case. However, under sustainable considerations, Utilities would avoid spending $753 million, which is the monetized value of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental and social costs.\[bullet] 15-year Drake operation with Neumann scrubber and potential new requirements on nitrogen oxides and no site remediation would cost $133 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities would avoid spending $148 million.\[bullet] 15-year Drake operation with Neumann scrubber technology and potential new requirements on nitrogen oxides with moderate site remediation would cost $135 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities avoids spending $149 million.\[bullet] 15-year Drake operation with Neumann scrubber technology and potential new requirements on nitrogen oxides with high site remediation would cost $138 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities avoids spending $151 million.\[bullet] Nine-year Drake operation with Neumann scrubber would cost $190 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities avoids spending $483 million.\[bullet] 30-year Drake operation with Neumann scrubber technology and potential new requirements on nitrogen oxides has the best financial return on investment of $216 million, compared to the base case. Under sustainable considerations, it would cost $151 million more than base case.\[bullet] Three-year Drake operation -- shutdown upon emissions compliance date, would cost $224 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities would avoid spending $434 million.\[bullet] Nine-year Drake operation with 150 megawatts of wind generation added upon retirement would cost $272 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities avoids spending $562 million.\[bullet] 20-year Drake operation and work to reduce electricity consumption by 4 percent would cost $324 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, it would cost $618 million more than base case.\[bullet] Drake operating on coal until 2022 and on natural gas from 2023 through 2033 would cost $208 million more than base case. Under sustainable considerations, Utilities avoids spending $362 million.\[bullet] Nine-year Drake operation and then replace with the engine generators on Drake site would cost $230 million more than base case.

112,"DENVER - Science fiction writers imagining 21st-century transportation envisioned flying cars, but they never pictured a dashboard device that would count every mile motorists drive and then charge them for it. \Yet, that is among the ideas that have passed from the realm of the fanciful into the possible as Colorado leaders consider how to pay for future highway construction. Leasing roads to private toll companies, charging fees to rush-hour commuters and increasing the state income tax are all on the table. \The reason for such radical thinking is that the gas tax, which has funded freeway building since Model T's dominated traffic, no longer works. \Increasingly fuel-efficient vehicles can travel more miles while burning less gas. While state and federal gas taxes have remained stagnant for a decade and a half, construction costs have risen precipitously, reducing the amount of construction and maintenance that can be done. \A governor-appointed Blue Ribbon Transportation Panel created this year drew little notice: It was the third such commission appointed in the past 15 years. But the members involved in this discussion say the time has come for big changes. \""It's a problem without an easy solution. So, to talk in terms of a tweak to the system, that isn't going to do it,"" said Dan Stuart, a former Manitou Springs mayor on the panel. ""Every driver, every citizen has to be paying attention to this problem. We don't want to leave it to our children."" \The gas tax, 22 cents in Colorado plus another 18.4 cents for the federal government, was the perfect user-pay tax in many ways. Motorists paid it at the pump every time they stopped for gas; the more they used the roads, the more they funded expansion and improvements. \But the 13-mile-per-gallon Gremlins of the 1970s have given way to hybrids that get up to 50 miles per gallon, or to electric or flex-fuel vehicles that use little gas at all. Gastax revenues in Colorado rose 7.7 percent from 1999 to 2006, while vehicle miles traveled increased at nearly double that pace and the cost of construction rose nearly eightfold. \Federal and state fuel taxes have lost at least one-third of their purchasing power since the national gas tax was last raised in 1993, according to a study from the National Chamber Foundation. The state gas tax last rose in 1991. \Revenues over the next 23 years will fall $500 billion short of meeting expected transportation needs at all levels of government, the same study said. A Colorado Department of Transportation analysis stated that $2 billion more a year is needed over the same time frame to implement its 2030 vision for state and local roads. \Help is not coming from the federal government. The Federal Highway Account will run out by 2009, meaning Congress can spend only what it brings in every year. \Add to that a projection by Oregon transportation official James Whitty that gas-tax revenues are expected to go from slow growth to permanent decline by 2021, and the urgency becomes clearer. \Meanwhile, 35 percent of Colorado's roads are in poor condition, meaning they've reached the point where they must be replaced rather than repaved, Stuart said. That figure will hit 60 percent in 15 years under current funding conditions. \It isn't just a matter of public safety. \Gov. Bill Ritter said earlier this year that expanding companies don't look at a state unless the transportation system works. \""We all feel an enormous responsibility that we keep this infrastructure safe,"" said Colorado Treasurer Cary Kennedy, one of the co-chairs of the panel. ""In my opinion, this is the single-biggest liability facing the state today."" \The question remains: How radical a change can the public accept? \Many Colorado legislators believe it highly unlikely that voters will approve a gas-tax hike at a time when fuel prices are near record levels. Ideas like raising the state income tax or indexing the gas tax to rise with inflation have been suggested, but voters may be slow to go for something so dramatic. \Discussions have centered on ""user pay"" ideas for motorists. \The proposal that has generated the most buzz is the vehicle miles tax, a system whose technology is not quite ready but could be ""the next generation of financing transportation,"" Kennedy said. How it works: A receiver is placed in every car and linked to a satellite that records how many miles are traveled, then imposes fees based on the total number and the percentage of miles driven during rush hours in congested zones. \Tolls are also drawing interest, especially the idea of charging more to use the congestion-free toll lanes during the busiest hours. Some cities and states have leased major highways to private toll companies and put the money toward construction backlogs. \Some argue that the public has paid for roads with its taxes and shouldn't have to pay even more to use them, but officials are finding toll concepts surprisingly popular. Flo Raitano, a member of the statewide panel's technical advisory committee, noted that when surveys are done, the vehicle miles tax gets more support than any other idea. \Linda Herpin of Colorado Springs drives 160 miles a day to get to and from her job in Denver and knows such userpay plans would hit her harder than most people. But philosophically, she finds it hard to disagree with. \""I should probably pay more for using the roads than some poor little lady who's just driving to church on Sunday,"" Herpin said. ""It's only fair."" \Not everyone is convinced that radical change is needed. \Two major bills in the past 10 years have funneled money to transportation, but legislators siphoned money, including $53.5 million this year, to other projects. If they could just keep their hands off that pot, roads would be in better shape, said Senate Minority Leader Andy McElhany, R-Colorado Springs. \Truckers also are leery because they already pay 35 percent of the taxes and fees that go into the Highway Users Trust Fund but drive just 7 percent of the total vehicle miles in the state, said Greg Fulton, president of the Colorado Motor Carriers Association. State regulations on trucking have driven many companies to locate just beyond Colorado's borders, leaving the state without any of the 100 largest trucking companies in the U.S., he said. \""We recognize that the state needs additional transportation funding. And we're not saying that at some point we won't consider it,"" Fulton said. ""But we have to have an environment that allows us to remain competitive."" \The panel is months from suggesting a solution. Though the advisory committee will recommend a package or series of packages on Aug. 24, the larger panel's recommendation is not due to Ritter until November. An October public hearing is scheduled in Colorado Springs. \Even after such a suggestion is made, there is no guarantee a tax or fee increase for roads will go to the voters in 2008. Panels also are discussing the future of health care and education in this state, and many believe that the three commissions' work could be lumped together in a large infrastructure-funding request. \Whatever happens, the days of simply collecting a gas tax to maintain the backbone of the state transportation system seem gone. \And whatever form the changes take, they're bound to cost motorists quite a bit. \""We're going to try to solve our transportation issues in a way that solves our economic and environmental problems,"" said Rep. Joe Rice, a Littleton Democrat and panel member. ""We're going to have to do some out-of-the-box thinking."" \CONTACT THE WRITER: (303) 837-0613 or ed.sealover@gazette.com FUTURE OF TRANSPORTATION \5 IDEAS \Tolls, taxes and tiny computers that track how far you've driven are three of the most popular solutions being considered to fund Colorado's transportation needs. Here's a look at a few other ideas: \1 \A California law enables governmental organizations to charge new homes and businesses impact fees for transportation based on how much traffic they are expected to generate. Ruthanne Taylor Berger, deputy executive director of the Western Riverside Council of Governments, noted that her growing area has raised $399 million in the past four years through the fee. Former Manitou Springs Mayor Dan Stuart, a member of Gov. Bill Ritter's Blue Ribbon Transportation Panel, questioned whether Colorado laws would allow such fees to be imposed. \2 \El Paso County is the poster child for a push to create more Rural Transportation Authorities, taxing entities like the Pikes Peak RTA created in 2004, that impose a sales tax to pay for highway building, maintenance and transit. Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments Executive Director Rob MacDonald has spoken at forums about the success of the regional approach to roadways. 3 \Michael Replogle, transportation director for the Washington, D.C.-based Environmental Defense, has argued that a number of federal and state laws discourage transit funding, such as a federal grant program that pays for 80 percent of highway work and 50 percent of light-rail projects. Colorado has some restrictions on using its gas tax to fund transit projects, and some members of the technical advisory committee to Ritter's panel have warned that transit must be included in any tax hike that goes to the voters. \4 \That same committee has considered options such as creating a lottery game, adding a surcharge to traffic violations and increasing the betting limit for casino gambling and taking a portion of that to raise more transportation revenues. \5 \Greg Fulton, president of the Colorado Motor Carriers Association, said there is still a problem with companies evading gas-tax payments and that stepping up enforcement could generate some of the money the state is seeking. Colorado Department of Transportation Chief Financial Officer Heather Kopp said, however, that the state has one of the lowest evasion rates in the country."
113," A deeply held commitment to the wonders of government social planning has turned the standoff over Europe's high gas taxes on its head.\ We've had to chuckle at some of the surprising reactions by leading editorialists to the serious gasoline shortage and widespread gas-price protests that have been spreading across Europe in recent days. Refineries, seaports and highways have been blockaded in England, France, Norway, Sweden, Slovenia and Spain by truckers angry about high gas taxes - which can account for 75 percent of gas prices in Europe.\ To hear some well-positioned editorialists tell it, European motorists should be applauding their nations' high gas taxes, and the United States should increase the gas taxes here.\ The Washington Post, for instance, criticized the French government for reducing its bloated gas taxes in response to the blockades. ""f OPEC gets the idea that industrial countries will respond to price hikes by cutting fuel taxes, it will no longer fear slower demand or inflation. Its main reason to restrain prices therefore will be gone.""\ That's a stretch. As is the Post's argument that ""governments should avoid rhetoric that implies they can solve the problem. The oil market is as willfully unpredictable as most other commodity markets.""\ But governments can solve those problems they have caused. Yes, commodity prices go up and down - but government-imposed taxes still account for the bulk of oil prices throughout Western Europe.\ Governments don't like to cut them because they want the revenue for their programs - only a small portion of the British fuel tax is used for infrastructure-related spending, according to a British Web site promoting the tax revolt - and like to hector us about how we live our lives.\ A more curious observation comes from the London-based Economist. It argues that ""Europe's higher petrol taxes have protected consumers from wild crude-oil price swings, while America's tax regime has left its consumers more painfully exposed to the whims of OPEC.""\ In other words, Europeans are far better off paying, say, a fairly steady $3.50 a gallon for gasoline, than Americans who have to put up with wild price swings ranging from, say, $1.30 a gallon to $2 a gallon. Those lucky Europeans. Would any Coloradans, however pained by our $1.60-a-gallon statewide average these days, care to pay the European average?\ Here's our favorite analysis, which comes from Monday's Philadelphia Inquirer:\ ""European governments have come to regard high gasoline taxes not only as a good way to raise money but also a means of discouraging car use and protecting the environment. Reasonable aims, those; America could use a bit more of that thinking.""\ Perhaps America will, as the Inquirer requests, get a few more barrels of that sort of thinking, should Al Gore get the 2000 presidential nod. In ""Earth in the Balance,"" Gore called for higher fossil fuel taxes to save the environment (p. 173).\ One of the few newspapers that got it right, The Wall Street Journal, points out Gore's high-gas-tax prescriptions, then suggests that GOP nominee George W. Bush explain to Gore ""the significance of the gas-tax tea party they've been throwing all over Europe.""\ As we see it, the significance is not the high price of oil, the evils of OPEC or the need for more energy conservation. It's about getting government to stop using tax policy as a way to engineer our lifestyles.\ Honoring a pledge\ Let's laud those who've stepped down\ As a northeastern Colorado congressman ponders whether to stick to his earlier pledge to stand for only three terms in office - absent voter-imposed term limits on Congress - we were struck by a recent article profiling five U.S. House members who are leaving voluntarily.\ However you feel about the sluggish term-limits movement - whether or not laws should limit the service of any officeholder - you have to admire the resolve and humility of anyone who can gain membership in so exclusive and addictive a club as Congress and then walk away. Reason magazine, in talking with House members who are honoring promises to leave after a few terms, uncovered among them a healthy perspective all too lacking in much of our nation's capital (see the October issue at www.reason.com).\ Typical of their insights was departing Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Coburn's rather dim view of his peers: ""Most of them are egomaniacs. There are not many normal people up here."" Or consider this take, by retiring House three-termer Matt Salmon, a Republican from Arizona who was asked if he'd consider a Senate bid: ""No. ... I'm not interested in coming back here. The only other job I might run for would be governor of Arizona ... But right now, I am ready to go back and make an honest living."" Refreshing.\ It's also food for thought for the likes of Rep. Bob Schaffer, the Colorado Republican who's wavering on his three-term pledge to voters."
114,"DENVER - Colorado voters may be asked to raise taxes for gasoline and vehicle ownership next year to pay for better roads.\A statewide ballot initiative to raise more money is one alternative offered by advisory panel set up by Gov. Roy Romer to look at transportation issues in the state. Other ideas from the panel include borrowing money by issuing bonds, establishing more toll roads and spending surplus state funds on highways.\The panel's final report, which has not been officially released, warns that Colorado's road and bridges have been so neglected that fixing them all will take 20 years and $13 billion beyond the amount of money already programmed for roads during that time.\""Let's be honest: These problems cannot be solved by mere belt-tightening,"" said the report, a copy of which was obtained by the Gazette Telegraph. ""They result not from government waste but from fundamental changes in our lifestyles and in the size of our population. And they will not go away.""\Colorado doesn't have to settle for a ""smog-filled, traffic-jammed future,"" the report said. But people who use the roads may have to foot part of the bill.\The panel recommends Romer use his office to back legislation and a 1997 state ballot initiative to raise more revenue for transportation.\The most notable suggestions:\Raising the state's gasoline tax by 36 percent, to 30 cents per gallon. At 22 cents, Colorado's tax already is one of the highest in the nation. Voters would have to approve any increase.\Raising the annual annual tax levied on the value of vehicles by an average of $40. Again, voter approval would be necessary.\Increasing vehicle registration fees by $40. Voter approval would not be necessary.\Sell bonds to pay for construction projects. The report was not clear about where the state should get the money to repay any bonds, so it's uncertain whether voter approval - normally required to increase the government's debt limit - would be needed.\Romer refused to talk about specific proposals Thursday because he had not seen the report. But the governor said he won't back any initiative without first hearing what the public thinks about it.\""We've got to engage people in the solution, take the alternatives to communities to see how they react, before packaging an answer,"" Romer said. ""I don't want to put something on the ballot that won't pass.""\Indeed, the panel's report recommends that local committees across the state should help decide exactly where the money should come from, before any measure is presented to voters.\State Treasurer Bill Owens said he agrees with the panel's advice to sell bonds to pay for highway construction, an idea he has been pushing for more than a year. But he doubts voters would, or should, approve a tax hike.\""We're taxing Coloradans enough right now,"" said the Republican former legislator, who said he would prefer to divert money from programs such as higher education and social services.\""If the state needs new funds for roads - which I think we do - the answer is to prioritize state spending,"" Owens said. ""Move back to the days when road construction was high on the state budget.""\State spending on highway construction, operation and repairs accounts for 6 percent of the state's budget. That's less than half of the share it received 25 years ago, according to a separate study by the Colorado Legislative Council.\Although fuel taxes in Colorado are relatively high, only about 53 cents of every fuel-tax dollar goes to the state Department of Transportation, which builds and maintains state highways. The rest is siphoned off by the federal government, cities and counties across Colorado, and a few state government agencies, including prisons.\In the end, only about 25 cents of every fuel-tax dollar is plowed into highway construction and repair.\The governor's bipartisan panel of 21 government, business and environment leaders spent six months analyzing the state's long-term transportation needs. Its findings square with previous studies that the 80,000 miles of public roads in Colorado are showing serious signs of wear, and in many cases need better access or more lanes.\Less than 10 years ago, more than 80 percent of the state roads were in good or fair condition; today only 50 percent meet that standard, the report said.\Road use has exploded over the past decade because of the state's 30 percent population growth, increases in freight and tourism, and longer commutes. The report cited forecasts that traffic on Colorado roads will have increased by 50 percent by 2016, doubling drive times.\""That means longer rush hours, more frequent jams and, for perhaps thousands of Coloradans, far fewer weekend trips to the mountains,"" the report said.\In addition to asking the General Assembly to seek voter approval for higher taxes, the report calls on lawmakers to:\Allow the state transportation department to assess impact fees on developers.\Explore the idea of a ""new wheels"" fee on vehicles brought into the state, and on new vehicles bought in Colorado.\Give local or regional governments taxing authority for road work.\The panel also encouraged the General Assembly to push for more toll roads and to keep allocating some surplus state funds to highways, as it has in recent years.\It won't be easy to pass such drastic legislation and secure public support for higher taxes, the report said. But it urged the governor, lawmakers, business leaders and public interest groups to act quickly.\""A deteriorating transportation infrastructure carries a price tag,"" the report concluded. ""The cost - to our time, our economy, our mobility, and our health, as well as our state budget - is rapidly escalating. Now is the time."""

Part two of the Ken Buck Town Hall meeting in Lamar picks up with what he called a misconception that the gas tax needs to be raised to pay for roads.
\
""What's happening in Wisconsin is they are using gas tax money to build a museum dedicated to educating the public about the role of the horse and carriage in early 1900's and late 1800's,"" he said. ""That's where your gas tax money went.""
\
Gas tax money was also used for bike lanes and highway beautification.
\
""If we used gas tax money to build and maintain roads we would have enough money,"" he said. ""As soon as we raise the gas tax, the liberals will say 'I've got an idea, let go spend gas tax money on light rail and airports.' The key is to use the money the way it was meant to be used, not to use it for all these other projects, and your county commissioners are going to able to do that better than some bureaucrat in Washington D.C. that doesn't care a hoot about Prowers County.""
\
ACA
\
PMC Hospital Board member Julie Branes had concerns about the Affordable Care Act and said they have heard rumors about changes to the ACA.
\
""The reimbursements are lower,"" she said. ""The costs of implementing the mandates are excessive especially in rural areas. Is there talk among your peers about this situation and are solutions being looked at?""
\
Buck said the federal government had no business taking over a healthcare system that was run well, not perfect, but well.
\
""What's going to happen is the same issue we just addressed here, the Denver interests are going to focus on Denver roads and expenditures, we are going to get hurt in rural health care more.""
\
The money is going to go the suburban areas, he said, and the rural areas will be hurt.
\
""We have got to get the federal government out of driving the healthcare business,"" he said.
\
There is a key case coming up in the Supreme Court (King v Burwell), he said, and the government is looking into the matter.
\
""When that case is decided it will give us the opportunity to use the marketplace in a way that is going to benefit rural healthcare,"" he said. ""There are bills that are being introduced right now in participation of that decision.""
\
The budget
\
Jim Gill asked the Congressman to go to his colleagues and ask them to stop passing continuing resolutions and submit a budget for the president to sign.
\
Buck called it a fair question.
\
""We have passed a budget and the problem with the Senate is that if you don't have 60 votes a minority leader like Harry Reid can hold things up,"" he said. ""We have passed a budget and we will pass appropriations bills and Harry Reid will hold those up and they will not get to the president's desk.""
\
Gill told him not to pass a continuing resolution and not worry about being held accountable for shutting down the government.
\
""We're going to pass appropriations bills,"" Buck said. ""We are going to put protections in to keep the government from using the money that will prohibit the Department of the Interior from Listing various animals as endangered species and taking away private property rights.""
\
When they reach the Senate, Buck said they probably won't get passed.
\
Changing the rules
\
Doing away with the 60-vote rule in the Senate is done ""at our own peril.""
\
""We have held up a lot of bad legislation out of harming this country because of the 60-vote rule,"" he said. ""If we change that rule, in two years if the Democrats take the Senate again, we will be ruing the day that we did that.""
\
He called it a short term solution for a one-year budget and not a long term solution.
\
Buck said he believes very strongly about local law enforcement and not federalization.
\
""As an elected official, I've talked about education and local control over transportation and giving control back to local communities,"" he said. ""The last thing I want to do is allow the federal government to have more control over law enforcement. It's a community decision, to me.""
\
Taxes and control
\
Dr. Gerald Branes said he feels that business goes where it gets treated best and politicians are forcing businesses to leave the country because they don't get taxed.
\
Buck said tax reform is a necessity to make businesses want to be in America.
\
""We have to lower the tax rate, which is the highest in the world,"" he said.
\
Corporate and individual tax reform, he said, should be ready by the end of the summer.
\
""The goal is that you can produce a tax return on a post card and turn it into the government,"" he said. ""The same thing goes for the corporate tax rate.
\
Local issues
\
In comments after the meeting, Buck said he supports taking agricultural hemp off the schedule one substance list and taking it away from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
\
""I have co-sponsored a bill in the house to do just that,' he said. ""We should allow hemp to be grown in the United States of America. When we look at the marijuana that's grown, hemp is not going to be used as a hallucinogen at all. It is an industrial product and should be treated as an industrial product.""
\
Any banking restrictions related to agricultural hemp, he said, should be eliminated.
\
""It is an agricultural product and it should not be restricted in terms of our banking rules."" He said.
\
Delisting the lesser prairie chicken is also a priority.
\
""There is really a war going on between environmentalists who are trying to restrict private property rights and those in this country who want reasonable regulations and grow our economy at the same time,"" he said. ""I fall on the side of those who believe in protecting our environment bur also making sure we have jobs and industry.""

Progressive 15 Progressive 15 held its 15th annual Fall Conference last week in Fort Morgan at the Country Steak-Out. Speakers and vendors from all over Colorado offered the group's members information and guidance on many topics. Progressive 15 then uses that information to set the group's policy positions. For more information, go to www.progressive15.org
\
Some big wigs in transportation recently visited Fort Morgan and had a frank discussion about the issues and changes the state, companies and drivers are facing or soon will face on the road.
\
Colorado Transportation Commissioner Kathy Gilliland moderated the transportation panel discussion at the Progressive 15 Fall Conference. She is no stranger to Fort Morgan, having held town hall listening tour stops here.
\
""The idea is to balance transportation and funding,"" she said, ""not just in the metro area, but across the state.""
\
Of course, that's a lot easier to say than to accomplish, she acknowledged.
\
CDOT's perspective Shailen Bhatt, the executive director of the Colorado Department of Transportation, also traveled to Fort Morgan to speak at the Progressive 15 event, but it was a less familiar drive for him.
\
""As I was driving down I-76, I was thinking, 'I bet it wasn't in this condition when it was built. Who needs rumble strips?'"" he said, only partially joking.
\
But the bumpy condition of the roadway on I-76 is a concern for CDOT, he said, if not one the state agency will be able to fully remedy anytime soon.
\
The state gas tax, a primary source of funding for transportation projects, has remained unchanged since 1992, Bhatt pointed out, so CDOT has to prioritize state funding.
\
""Primarily out here, the interstate is getting goods to market,"" he said. ""With where we're headed as a state from a financial perspective, we're in a bit of a bind.""
\
Another issue CDOT is examining is how driver-less cars will impact highway safety and infrastructure needs, Bhatt said.
\
""If cars are talking to each other, which is about 10 years out, do we need 12-foot lanes on highways, or 8-foot lanes?"" he said. ""We could get more roads just by re-striping them. ... Autonomous vehicles are coming. They're vehicles that will be hard-pressed to crash.""
\
But first, vehicle-makers and technology companies will need to work together, he said.
\
""There's this battle between the car manufacturers, who want to put technology in cars, and technology companies, who want to put wheels on technology,"" Bhatt said.
\
But this new technology also could lead to ""connected trucks,"" for hauling goods, where the truck, itself, could take over when the trucker needs to rest, he said.
\
Trucker issues Greg Fulton, president of the Colorado Motor Carriers Association, addressed more of the issues concerning truckers.
\
""Everybody in the room is touched by the things that (truckers) do -- both positively and negatively,"" Fulton said.
\
Colorado is proof that thriving communities usually have a ""major truckload carrier"" and ""the right tax environment,"" Fulton said. But the state also has a growth problem: more people are moving here, but there is not any new capacity for trucking infrastructure.
\
""We can only get so far with technology,"" Fulton said. ""We have 100,000 people in trucking. That's one out of 20 workers.""
\
These truckers make an average salary of $50,000 a year plus benefits, he said, making them strong parts of local economies.
\
But the overall industry is short about 950,000 drivers, which soon could cause some big problems for commerce, Fulton said.
\
Along with that are roads that would be affected by more heavy loads and every tighter public funding for infrastructure improvements.
\
""We recognize the challenges, and that means we're going to have to make investment in infrastructure,"" he said. ""We want to stand up, and we want to move this ball forward.""
\
Contractor issues Tony Milo, executive director of the Colorado Contractors Association, knows something about the costs of infrastructure projects and tight budgets.
\
""We're working on dollars from 1991-1992,"" he said, ""but our population has grown.""
\
The state saw a jump from 27 billion to nearly 50 billion vehicle miles traveled each year, he said, which takes a harsh toll on roads that can't easily be maintained.
\
""Our funding system we have right now is not sustainable,"" he said. ""We all realize there's a problem, and we want to work together to find a solution. Voters are starting to realize this is a problem.""
\
But trying to get increased gas taxes passed at high enough levels to fund all the needed transportation infrastructure projects probably would not work, he said.
\
""People are very protective of the dollars they spend on gas,"" he said. ""We need a dedicated funding source for our transportation system. The longer we wait, the more expensive it's going to be to fix.""
\
Transit issues Truckers are not the only ones on the road, though, and Elena Wilkin, Colorado Association of Transit Agencies executive director, spoke about transit needs and issues at the Progressive 15 event.
\
""Progressive 15 has 14 counties that are covered by transit,"" she pointed out to the group's members. ""You have our smallest fixed-route system in Sterling, and NECALG has been taxing itself for at least 20 years to support transit. A lot of rural areas don't do that.""
\
Colorado and the nation are seeing a shift in the line between urban transit systems and how transit is looked at in rural areas, Wilkin said. The key, then, is figuring out ""how do we get more with the system we have in place?""
\
Public-private partnerships will help with that, she said, pointing to Banner Health's patient connections system for helping transport people to health-care facilities for appointments and procedures.
\
""Colorado is already on the front edge"" for public-private transit partnerships, Wilkin said.

117,"Bumpy road ahead \Improving transportation will cost taxpayers \It was certainly no surprise that Gov. Bill Ritter's Blue Ribbon Transportation Commission recommended more spending to address the state's growing transportation needs. A drive along most of the state roads or highways in Colorado reveals the need for more maintenance and, in some cases, new construction. Some maintenance has been put off while legislators poached highway funds for other projects. \Also no surprise was where the panel planned to get that money: higher taxes and more fees. There are few places in the budget for the state to trim to come up with the $1.5 billion the panel says the state needs to spend to improve Colorado's roads and bridges. Except maybe if legislators put back the millions they've siphoned off from transportation funding to finance other projects. \According to a Gazette news report last week, the panel recommended raising the gas tax, sales tax and fees on vehicle registrations and a few other taxes and fees when it presented its report to Ritter. The report also contained a blueprint on how to spend the money the panel wants to see flowing the state's way. \Transportation funding comes from state and federal gas taxes and a portion of the sales and use tax revenue that exceeds the 6 percent growth cap on the general fund. With the passage of Referendum C allowing the state to keep excess revenue, there should be plenty of money for road maintenance and construction. Except, according to a Gazette story earlier this year, lawmakers have been shifting money around to ensure their projects get funding before transportation. Since one of the selling points for passing Referendum C was increased highway spending, it seems dishonest to shift money around and shortchange transportation. Legislators should return that money before asking Coloradans for more. \Barring that, lawmakers should take a close look at the panel's recommendations for divvying up the proceeds from the tax and fee hikes. They call for about $538 million to go to increasing the safety and maintenance of highways, including improvements to bridges. Local roads would get about $293 million and another $107 for ""transit, environmental needs and bike and pedestrian pathways."" Depending on project specifics, we might quibble with using transportation money for bike and pedestrian trails if they're intended primarily for recreation rather than transportation. A long, scenic bike path is nice for a weekend ride, but few people want to ride their bikes miles out of their way to get and from work. \Our real concern is the $562 million the panel says should be spent on ""mobility needs."" We're on board with the $60 million for speeding up construction projects on major roads. The rest of the money, roughly $502 million, is where the trouble lies. The panel divides the money equally; one $251 million fund going to transit projects and the other going to either highway expansion or transit, depending on the needs of the state. \The first fund would finance ""interregional transit projects such as creating a Front Range commuter rail,"" according to The Gazette's story. That's an editorial for another day and we'll revisit that if this proposal goes to the voters. \The second fund is particularly troubling, since it has the potential to become a political football. According to the story, the ""biggest fight on the 32-person commission was about whether to put more of the mobility funding toward buses and trains or toward more driving lanes."" \If a 32-member commission can't agree on the proper mix of highways and transit, imagine how difficult it will be for the entire state. Politicians and advocates will be in a continual tugof-war to see their favorite projects get funding. \The governor will decide whether to back putting this idea before the voters. We'll wait to see the final proposal before we make up our minds. Building and maintaining roads and highways is a legitimate function of government, but those needs shouldn't be held hostage to the social engineering inherent in transit projects. The panel's recommendations could face a bumpy road ahead. \EU forcing warming 'solution' on others \If other nations hamstring their economies with dubious plans to save the planet, we won't argue with them. But, inevitably, commissars' power grabs seek to control others. Last week the European Union voted to impose carbon dioxide emission reductions starting in 2011 on airlines flying into Europe, as well as within the continent. \The New York Times described the EU scheme as ""a global warming control plan that would require"" emissions be offset by buying CO2 credits in a cap-and-trade market. \Whether one considers climate change a catastrophic danger or a benign natural occurrence, the EU action is first and most importantly about controlling others. The contrived emissions market is the EU's principal anti-global warming tool. It limits how much CO2 industries may emit. Companies may exceed limits if they buy credits, or sell surplus credits to others if they stay under limit. \""Carbon trading is excellent for the fraudster, good for the robber baron, ineffective for the environment, bad for the economy as a whole and disastrous for the poor,"" writes Iain Murray, senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Despite negligible effect on CO2 emissions, energy prices skyrocketed. \The cap-and-trade auction system operating in Europe since 2005 is an ""administrative nightmare"" that imposes huge costs on businesses and results in job losses, says U.K. Think tank Open Europe. Now the EU wants to extend this disaster to airlines, and not just European carriers. No wonder the United States and the International Civil Aviation Organization oppose it. We do, too."
118,"Economy and Jobs KPA vision statement: ""A good economic standard of living for all residents of Colorado Springs.""\Key Indicators\The bottom line is for all population segments of the region be able to answer ""yes"" to the following questions:\Do you have a job (or source of income)?\Do you have a satisfactory standard of living?\Are you secure in your job or source of income? Some key indicators could be job growth, wage levels, export sales, open space, housing affordability, poverty rates, employment rates, work force training and education levels.\Colorado Springs has a unique opportunity to create and maintain an economy that will sustain a satisfactory standard of living and provide security for our children and grandchildren well into the 21st century. Building on our historic foundations, our businesses and industries will operate on the ""cutting edge"" of technology and our community will be known as the pioneers of innovation. To accomplish this, the following four objectives have been identified:\Objective 1: Decrease leakage of community resources resulting from purchases outside of the community.\Actions:\Survey present and prospective employers to identify needs and opportunities for local suppliers.\Develop and implement plans to fill local supply gaps through linking businesses with local suppliers.\Foster creating local capacity through a program of small business and entrepreneur financial support and training.\Develop a systematic process to monitor, follow up and correct obstacles.\Educate the public on the benefits of buying locally and the economic impact of purchases made outside of the community.\Develop a system of preference for locally owned companies in government purchasing.\Objective 2: Grow, retain, expand, attract employers which provide a high return on community assets they consume.\Actions:\Establish parameters of ""return"" on community investment for community assets, both tangible and non-tangible, consumed by employers, including at least environment, public safety, workforce, natural beauty, utilities, schools, telecommunications and transportation systems.\Identify the cost/benefit relationship of current and prospective types of employers for each of the identified community assets.\Identify the desirable balance of employer contributions vs. consumption of community assets.\Assist local companies to improve their cost/benefit characteristics.\Apply cost/benefit to determine approaches to most desirable employers for start-up, retention, expansion and attractions.\Favor incentives to businesses that provide a high return on consumed community assets.\Promote regional consciousness.\Objective 3: Grow, retain, expand attract employers which enjoy a national/global comparative advantage by operating locally.\Actions:\Identify desirable employers/business clusters.\Research and analyze the needs of desirable employers to create or maintain their comparative advantage.\Identify the strengths, improvement opportunities and gaps between the needs of desirable employers/business clusters and existing conditions/programs in the community.\Develop strategies and implement plans to create and maintain comparative advantages for desirable employers/business clusters.\Objective 4: Grow, retain, expand responsible employers which provide support for the community which supports them.\Actions:\Develop standards for ""responsible corporate citizens"" in the areas of labor/management relations, charitable support to the community through both financial and volunteer support, environmental sensitivity including recycling and responsible land use, and support of local work force and working conditions.\Create community awareness of corporate citizenship expectations to include a recognition program and incentive campaign.\Remaining work of the task force:\Further refine the objectives; identify key players and implementers for each task; define time lines for implementation and completion.\Education\Our Education task force has worked hard to develop a mini-vision and a number of objectives that could be established to accomplish it. We began by listing 37 objectives and then narrowed that list to three objectives that seemed to have the highest priority.\Objective 1: To optimize the learning process to assure ultimate learning and performance through the design and implementation of learning systems which support all individuals.\Action Plans:\Ensure and provide equal access to quality early childhood programs for all children, birth through kindergarten, to nurture developmental assets. Through memoranda of understandings use collaboratives of groups already involved in these kinds of programs in our community. The estimated cost would be $6,000 per child. Begin in 1996 and use neighborhood needs assessment, registration services outcomes and total program evaluation. Publish statistics in an annual report card.\Open area schools and neighborhood learning centers for learners at non-traditional hours and at non-traditional times. Use collaboratives of existing schools and agencies with written memoranda of understandings. Estimate of cost is $500 per learner. Start in fall of 1996 and measure through neighborhood needs assessment.\Ensure and provide opportunities for families to learn together. Estimate of cost $600 per learner. Begin in spring of 1997 and measure success by statistics to show entrance level of learners and academic movement each semester and publish them in an annual report card.\Plan and implement alternative learning systems to meet the needs of the non-traditional learner. Maybe open an El Paso County model alternative campus with attendant services to operate from 7 to 10 p.m., seven days a week. Use memoranda of understanding with existing schools and agencies. Details to be worked out.\Objective 2: To develop partnerships between the public schools and the community.\Action Plans:\Establish a Greater Colorado Springs Educational Partnership responsible for establishing partnerships to further the development of an exceptionally high-quality K-16 education system for the area. The partnership will focus on education and work force issues of communitywide importance that are regional in scope.\Early priorities for the partnership should be to: Assess the educational needs of the region; set educational goals and objectives for the region and develop short- and long-range plans to accomplish those goals and objectives; establish regional priorities for action; acquire and efficiently manage its assets through partnerships with local business, government, non-profits, the military and community members; establish an educational foundation to support its educational initiatives through grants, gifts and corporate sponsorships; and measure the degree of success in meeting its goals.\Establish the partnership by using to the extent possible those organizations that may already be working on the objectives above. Organize through memoranda of understanding and use shared resources, begin fall of 1997.\Establish a ""HEXAD ACADEMY"" a six-year learning program that is seamless. It would be an integrated sequence for what we now call the last two years of high school, the community college and the state four-year institutions. It would be for most students: beginning at age 16 they could complete their high school diploma, AA and BA degrees by age 22. This would be a collaborative between K-16 educational institutions starting in 1997, using shared resources.\Objective 3: To provide the public information about education.\Action Plans:\Implement a media campaign that focuses on youth and quality education. Build a collaboration with the Advertising Council and local media. Short-term plan.\Set up a business oversight committee to review management/spending of school districts and report as part of an annual report card. Use Citizens Goals to establish a collaborative of school districts, the Chamber of Commerce, etc. Medium-term plan.\Educate the community about the Building Accountability Advisory Committee process, which is mandated statewide and is an excellent tool for making a difference in education. Citizens Goals might act as a resource agency to coordinate training for area school districts. Short-term plan.\Share educational KPA plans with all area public and private school districts, and obtain feedback. Use mailing, phones and the area superintendents meetings. Also work with other KPA task forces to measure and publicize their objectives. Form a public information subcommittee. The Education KPA will do this and develop measurement plans. Short-term plan.\Co-chairs: James A. Null, 593-3386; Marijane Paulsen, 550-7551.\City Government\The City Government task force, a diverse group of concerned citizen volunteers, has been engaged since the beginning of the year in a thorough and critical review/analysis of City services, enterprises, revenue generation and tax policies, compensation polices and operating efficiencies to produce an action plan that will help facilitate the task force's vision for the future of the City and its infrastructure.\Objective:\The task force has concluded that the first priority for our city's annual budget is $20 million to $25 million a year for infrastructure. Other City services would be subordinate to infrastructure needs.\Progress Report:\Meeting nearly every Thursday evening since late January, the City Government task force has been educated on City and Utility Department infrastructure, revenue source/gennding proposals, etc.; and divided into sub-committees that have devoted considerable time studying the four key areas of interest:\Preliminary ideas/courses of action:\City services: Reduce/eliminate those City services ranked ""less essential"" by task force members and the City's technical and senior administrative staffs to help fund infrastructure.\Privatization: Privatize through lease arrangements the City's golf courses to provide ongoing capital the city could use to help offset projected budget shortfalls. Consider partial sale of Memorial Hospital for the same purpose.\Revenue generation: Generate capital improvement funds earmarked specifically for storm-water drainage needs (one of the biggest ""drains"" on the City's capital improvement budget) through creation of a storm-water enterprise and collection of ""storm-water drainage"" fees.\Compensation policy: Take immediate corrective action on the City's present compensation policy, which left unchecked, would consume all projected increases in City budget revenue (first year savings of up to $3 million).\Operating efficiency: Form a business/city/community team under the leadership of a respected business or civic leader (or small commission) that would focus on reviewing City operations, department by department, to identify further efficiency and privatization opportunities.\KPA task force meetings:\Task force meetings remain open to the public. Any interested/concerned citizen is encouraged to participate. Your involvement and/or feedback is critical to our success. We would appreciate your views on the preliminary ideas/courses of action above. Scheduled meetings are 6:30 to 9 p.m. Thursdays.\Call Charles Doolittle at 578-6600, or co-chairs, Lionel Rivera at 630-6000 or Jim English at 598-0454, with comments or for information.\Growth\Objectives for the Growth KPA:\Over the next 20 years, as Colorado Springs grows in population, we seek to guide the expansion of our man-made environment in a manner that enhances and reflects our unique natural environment while providing for human needs such as housing, transportation and infrastructure.\We recognize the value of continual, moderate growth for the economic health of our community and we want to absorb that growth in ways that will preserve our beauty and way of life rather than having growth overwhelm us.\Following are the Growth action plan objectives. Note that they are not listed in priority order, nor have they been completely refined. Much work remains to be done. The committee will meet again at 6:30 p.m. April 25, in the cafeteria of the City Administration Building. Public participation and comment is encouraged.\Objective: Maintain or improve the level of community infrastructure by recognizing that infrastructure must keep up with population demands. Anticipate and plan for infrastructure before growth occurs.\Actions: Encourage full use of existing facilities. Ensure new areas of development are coordinated with existing and proposed facilities. Design transportation corridors to help control urban sprawl. Encourage use of natural land features to reduce infrastructure costs within areas where it is efficient, such as watershed, drainage channels. Concentrate like businesses and services with their support services. Establish housing near work environments to reduce trip times and distances.\Objective: Create patterns of growth that reinforce, rather than destroy, the character of our community and its natural environment. Design a system specifically tailored to our community's economic, use. Use waterway and drainage channels effectively.\Objective: Develop ""Future"" communities: Create new patterns of development which meet public needs while respecting and perpetrating those attributes of our community that give it a unique sense of place and high quality of life.\Actions: Identify the most suitable locations for needed development, including the need for a range of housing types and employment centers. Encourage ""cluster"" development to conserve land and to establish a closer sense of community identity and pride while providing actual and visual openness. Improve housing opportunities, increase diversity of housing types and promote better development plans.\Objective: Encourage affordable housing to meet the needs of a variety of income levels. Encourage redevelopment of blighted areas.\Actions: Address the impact of growth on the supply of low- and moderate-income housing. Preserve the character of existing communities and promote community identity.\Objective: Promote aesthetics and preserve historic or cultural features.\Actions: Create historical overlay zones to allow growth without destroying the character of existing houses or historic structures. Eliminate commercial strip zoning to maintain visual quality, reduce traffic congestion and improve highway safety. Adopt higher standards for curb cuts, parking, signs and landscaping to upgrade appearance and safety of existing strip zones.\Objective: Promote environmental education and action for the purpose of fostering intelligent decision-making by the community regarding choices that affect our environment.\Actions: Encourage a broad range of environmental education and action focused on all sectors of the community. Develop a coalition of government, school, business and private gd federal sources.\Actions: Work with congressional delegation to return higher percentage of federal gas tax to state. Lobby for increased federal funds for specific transportation projects. Unify local delegation to increase state gas tax revenues returned to El Paso County. Establish user-pay systems for key transportation systems and encourage use of public funding mechanisms.\Objective: Better integration of master urban-land development and use plan with transportation systems.\Actions: Organize public and private partnership to reach consensus on land and transportation plan. Develop ""backbone"" transportation system upon which land uses are planned and developed. Improve the traffic calming balance between jobs and housing (mixed use).

119,"LEGISLATURE\DENVER - Your taxes will go down - by historic proportions - and you'll get a refund, too.\Charter schools will get more money and so will programs to prevent smoking and other health services.\But the 62nd Colorado General Assembly did not produce solutions to all of the issues raised in 623 bills introduced during its 120- day session.\Whether or not the state can go into debt to speed up highway construction will be left to voters in November.\It won't be any easier to get a concealed-gun permit, and late- term abortions are still legal.\The session was one of change. It was a time for the testing of waters by newly elected Gov. Bill Owens and inexperienced leaders in both chambers.\It was a time of intense learning by a huge crop of freshmen. A time when the strength of political conviction often counted for more than party loyalty. A time influenced by outside tragedy.\Most lawmakers heeded the governor's call to take things slow, to tackle taxes and traffic instead of ideological crusades.\There were few surprises or drastic changes to existing laws; most victories were small ones.\The exception, of course, was tax cuts.\Owens kept promise\Owens pledged during his campaign to lower taxes on individuals and businesses.\And with a surplus expected to reach $5.6 billion over the next six years, the General Assembly helped him keep his promise. The result is the largest permanent tax cut in the state's 123-year history.\Lawmakers passed at least $278 million in permanent tax cuts and another $200 million in temporary cuts that kick in only if there's enough in the surplus.\That pot of excess money - which the state can't spend without the permission of voters - keeps getting bigger every day. It's so full now that in addition to your tax break, you'll probably get a refund ranging from at least $86 for people earning less than $25,000 to $303 for anyone who makes more than $125,000.\Here's how the tax package breaks out: Income tax bills will be 5 percent lower for individuals and businesses. Married couples who don't itemize will save about $72. There will be extra savings for the working poor; people with interest, dividend or capital gains; and anyone over age 65 with retirement savings.\Businesses also can qualify for a rebate on portions of the personal property tax bill, and at least a dozen industries will get special tax breaks.\""That tax package is one I'll be proud to sign,"" Owens said Wednesday. ""I think it's fair to Colorado. It protects the needs of the state while being fair to taxpayers, who for several years have been paying more than the state is allowed to keep.""\Others are not as sure.\""It was the year for tax cuts, but whether it was good for Colorado is up for debate,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mike Feeley, D-Lakewood. ""We may have done some long-term damage to the state budget.""\Road-building detour\Another major issue facing lawmakers was transportation. Frustrated drivers want to know how long it's going to take to get Colorado traffic moving again. The question lingers.\The key to the governor's transportation package - highway bonds paid back with federal gas tax dollars - must go to the voters by order of the state Supreme Court. Even if it doesn't pass, Senate President Ray Powers argues that transportation got a boost this year when lawmakers agreed to give highways priority over all other state construction projects if money is short.\""The money we set aside in earlier years was in jeopardy and could have bumped up against other construction needs,"" said Powers, R- Colorado Springs. ""Now we have guaranteed $200 million this year - and it goes up $12 million a year after that - will go to highways.""\Lawmakers devoted considerable attention to traffic issues.\They made it more difficult for local law enforcement to use photo radar, cracked down on drunken drivers, imposed new rules on teen- age drivers and told parents to buckle up their kids.\Anyone whose vehicle has been towed will be glad to know companies now have to make a good-faith effort to track down owners of abandoned vehicles found on private property before selling them.\Charter schools cash\Six years after their creation, charter schools were embraced by lawmakers, who gave them 95 percent of their per-pupil funding, the ability to bond for construction and the right to keep leftover cash instead of returning it to the school district.\But two measures to expand alternative education failed. Applicants for charter status can't bypass the local school board by applying to the state. And traditional public schools will not be granted waivers that would free them of state regulations. An attempt to reimburse parents for private pre-school tuition also was rejected.\The state will spend about $3.1 billion to help run schools this year, a 2.5 percent increase, which is above the rate of inflation for the first time in years. Mindful of a pending lawsuit against the state for failure to help poor school districts with construction, Owens proposed using $380 million of the national tobacco settlement to fund grants and loans.\He threatened to veto any plan to spend the tobacco windfall - $2.6 billion over 25 years - unless it ""addressed the legitimate safety needs of Colorado's public schools.""\In the final hours of the session, lawmakers had agreed to fully fund the Children's Basic Health Plan for low-income kids. They also wanted to pay for smoking-related research, reading programs, a visiting-nurse program and school violence prevention. But the school funding question was a source of heated debate.\Otherwise, it wasn't a banner year for health care. There are new coverage policies for insurance companies that will help patients who are denied treatment, children with birth defects and those who need home care.\""I'm not sure we should do much more right now because the health- care environment is changing so rapidly,"" said Rep. Marcy Morrison, R- Manitou Springs, who persuaded colleagues to set up a health-care task force.\Property rights\Another critical area that will get a second look is growth. Efforts to control sprawl got short shrift this session from lawmakers, who were more intent on protecting the rights of property owners.\Local governments will be forced to toe the line on existing ""takings"" and ""vested rights"" laws, but successfully fought off an attempt to lock in development rights earlier in the process.\Residents of eastern El Paso County also failed to persuade lawmakers to intervene in a zoning dispute with county commissioners.\Gun debate muted\People who are frustrated with strict local gun rules or want easier access to concealed-weapons permits will have to wait.\A trio of controversial gun bills were abruptly spiked - two withdrawn by the sponsors and the third facing a certain veto - in the wake of the Columbine High School shootings.\""If we had gone ahead, we wouldn't have looked real good,"" said Senate Majority Leader Tom Blickensderfer, R-Englewood. ""After that, people became real hesitant to talk about anything relating to firearms or violence.""\And it appears the issue won't return any time soon. '""It's unlikely we'll hear them again next year, either,"" said House Majority Leader Doug Dean, R-Colorado Springs.\Workers' rights\Labor unions dodged the bullet by defeating bills to make Colorado a right-to-work state and prevent them from deducting political funds from the paychecks of state workers.\But workers' compensation rules were tightened. Supporters want to cut down on abuse. Critics say the bill favors insurance companies over working people.\There may be a ballot measure in 2000 to abolish the system and allow injured employees to sue their employers.\Lawmakers refused to raise the minimum wage and voted to forbid local governments from doing so.\But workplace harassment may result in punitive damages against employers.\DNA tests for felons\Lawmakers went after sexual offenders by raising the age of child victims, opening the records of violent juveniles to the public, instituting tougher registration requirements and allowing courts or parole boards to order a community be notified of sexual predators.\They also took an old idea - collecting DNA from every sex offender - and applied it to all convicted violent felons. Their genetic data will be kept on file at the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and be made available to any law enforcement agency.\Convicted prostitutes will be tested for HIV, and sentences must be tripled for those who knew they were infected before the offense.\Potpourri of issues\Lawmakers rejected attempts to increase competition in the telecommunications industry. They voted to deregulate the natural gas market. And the records of public utilities will remain open to the public.\Religious organizations will get no protection against breach-of- trust lawsuits by people claiming they were molested by clergy.\Sticking to the middle of the road on social issues, lawmakers did not vote to embrace covenant marriages or reject same-sex marriages from other states. It outlawed female genital mutilation but refused to increase penalties for hate crimes or to second-guess voters by making late-term abortions illegal.\""The governor set a modest, reachable agenda and will get almost everything he asked for,"" said House Speaker Russell George, R- Rifle. ""When it's done, he can claim success - and so can we, as a Legislature.""\- Story editor Bill Vogrin; Headline by Barry Noreen\INTERIM STUDY ISSUES\The General Assembly will study the following issues before the beginning of the next session in January 2000:\Senate Joint Resolution 34 Child care in Colorado: quality of care, background checks, compensation of employees and ways to encourage employers to offer on-premises care for employees.

120,"\The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) has launched a Colorado Road Usage Charge Pilot Program (RUCPP) website to test whether road usage charging — an approach where, instead of paying a tax on how much gas is purchased, drivers pay a fee for how many miles are traveled — could be feasible for Colorado.\""Colorado's population is expected to nearly double by 2040 to 7.8 million residents, bringing more demands for mobility, and on our transportation infrastructure,"" said CDOT Executive Director Shailen Bhatt.\""A healthy transportation system is the backbone of our state's economy and way of life. As the state's transportation funding gap under the current gas tax grows, we need to explore possible funding opportunities — such as road usage charging (RUC) — to ensure Coloradans the mobility they need to live, work and play.""\To learn why CDOT is exploring the RUCPP (a pay-by-mile charge), understand what RUC is (and isn't), receive updates on the status of the pilot, compare a driver's current gas tax paid with an estimated RUC, visit ruc.codot.gov . The website is also the place to express interest in being a pilot participant.\The pilot will research how a pay-by-mile system compares to current gas tax paid. Research topics include:\• mileage-reporting technologies along with a manual-reporting option;\• how these technologies work in Colorado's environment; and\• the difference between rural and urban drivers, and others.\With this pilot, CDOT will gain real-world experience about road usage charging as a funding alternative. Approximately 100 Colorado drivers will participate in the pilot study, which will begin in late fall and end in spring 2017. The research team will share its findings later in 2017.\CDOT is facing a nearly $1 billion annual funding gap over the next 25 years and is looking to explore transportation funding alternatives as the gas tax continues to become less reliable over time, due decreased purchasing power and more fuel efficient and electric vehicles. This pilot is the first step in an extensive process of evaluating the concept alongside other funding alternatives.\""CDOT is proud to be working with the public, stakeholders, elected officials, amd community and transportation leaders on the RUC pilot program,"" said Tim Kirby, CDOT's manager of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) and Regional Planning section.\""The Colorado Road Usage Charge Pilot Program will engage a diverse group of drivers, from rural to urban, mountains to plains, and cars and trucks to be participants. We look forward to learning from the RUC pilot participants' experiences to learn more about this potential funding alternative."""
121,"The last days of the General Assembly’s 16-week session were a flurry of self-congratulations on what lawmakers did and the usual plea for patience on what they did not.\The session significantly changed the state’s environmental, public health, political, business and criminal justice landscapes. And it was a good time to be a Democrat, controlling both legislative chambers and the governor’s office.\Have the latest legislative and other news sent to your inbox with The Gazette’s newsletters\Lawmakers gave communities more control over oil and gas operations, moved the state toward wedding its presidential pick to the national popular vote, and reformed the criminal justice system, lowering penalties for minor drug possession and waiving bail for minor offenses.\The Legislature provided free all-day kindergarten, passed a raft of bills to chip away at the high cost of health care and insurance, and added millions of dollars for transportation and education.\“I think we took on a lot,” said House Speaker KC Becker, D-Boulder, before her chamber gaveled the session to a close about 6:40 p.m. Friday.\Gov. Jared Polis said he “couldn’t be more thrilled that we got so much done.” Still, he added, “No Legislature will solve every problem in four months.”\His quest to raise money for preschool and child health programs through cigarette and vaping taxes died in the Senate, and a repeal of Colorado’s death penalty — which hasn’t been carried out for 22 years — was dropped a month ago.\Democrats had the power to pass anything they wanted. But Becker said, “When you know things have a better chance of passing, you have to take more time with them, be more deliberative, involve stakeholders more, and that’s what’s going on,.\“I think Senate Republicans especially ... have done a good job of slowing the process.”\That they did. Debates on bills dragged on for hours, and controversial bills went through the night to early morning. Bills and constituent emails were read at length and Supreme Court decisions recited with the rhetorical flourishes you’d expect from 100 politicians.\Senate President Leroy Garcia of Pueblo and Senate Majority Leader Steve Fenberg of Boulder echoed Becker’s views on Democrats’ successes on many fronts.\Significantly, Polis created the Office of Saving People Money on Health Care and put Lt. Gov. Dianne Primavera in charge of it, boosting her pay by more than $74,000. The return on that theoretically will be in the price of insurance premiums.\ Energy and climate \A bill high on the Democratic wish list was the climate action plan to cut greenhouse emissions from 2005 levels by at least 26% by 2025, at least 50% by 2030 and 90% by 2050.\House Bill 1261 passed Wednesday, as Republicans complained about its potential impact on the economy.\The Senate amended it to address disproportionately affected communities, to grant more credit for technology that cuts emissions and to instruct regulators to consider how new rules affect electricity reliability.\“I think climate change is so important, because I really believe we have a limited amount of time to address it,” said Becker, a bill sponsor.\Another Becker bill, Senate Bill 181, marked a watershed change for environmentalists opposed to oil and gas operations. The measure gives local entities control and recasts the oil and gas regulatory board to focus on public health, safety and the environment.\Opponents said the bill would eliminate jobs and tax revenue from extraction along the Front Range, as companies look elsewhere.\The last chapter on the issue has not been written, however, as Weld County opponents to the law work on a ballot question to undo constraints on the industry.\ Heat over red flags \Among the 2019 session’s early bills, none generated more controversy than the “red flag” gun bill, House Bill 1177, also known as the Deputy Zackari Parrish III Violence Prevention Act. It’s named for the Douglas County sheriff’s deputy who was gunned down Dec. 31, 2017, by a man believed to be mentally ill.\The bill allows a court to order that guns be seized from someone whom evidence shows can pose a threat to themselves or others.\The 2018 version had bipartisan support from its House co-sponsors, Reps. Alec Garnett, D-Denver, and Cole Wist, R-Centennial, as well as notable Republicans such as 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler and Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock.\Wist, the House assistant minority leader last year, lost his re-election to Tom Sullivan of Centennial, a gun control activist whose son Alex was killed in the Aurora theater shootings in 2012. Brauchler lost his bid for state attorney general.\Most of that Republican support,except Spurlock’s, evaporated with the 2019 version, which lengthened how much time a seized firearm could be held.\The bill drew opposition from pro-gun rights groups and opponents who packed the Capitol for both of its hearings.\Democrats in swing districts voted against the bill, including Senate President Garcia and Democratic Reps. Bri Buentello of Pueblo and Don Valdez of La Jara.\By the time the bill hit the Senate on March 7, a dozen rural counties had declared themselves “sanctuaries,” meaning they don’t intend to enforce the law. Eventually, 36 of the state’s 64 counties — including El Paso, Douglas and Weld — passed resolutions against the bill, which Polis signed into law April 12.\By then, recall committees were organizing against Polis, Garcia, Buentello and Spurlock.\The Rocky Mountain Gun Owners announced a lawsuit Thursday challenging the measure.\ Workplace pay and leave \Democrats passed the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act, after years of seeing the proposal die in the Republican-led Senate.\Senate Bill 85 passed the House 40-21, then passed the Senate 20-14, picking up support from Republican Sens. Don Coram of Montrose and Kevin Priola of Henderson.\The measure lets workers sue over sex discrimination on pay and bars employers from seeking an applicant’s wage history to determine pay.\Meanwhile, a paid family leave program got farther than ever in five years of Democrats’ efforts, but it didn’t cross the finish line. Instead, a task force will study the proposed insurance program to pay for a worker’s leave for up to 12 weeks for an illness or to care for a loved one.\Small business and Democratic skeptics, including Polis, wanted more information on whether the fund could bring in enough money to cover its claims.\With that information, the bill’s sponsors, Sens. Faith Winter, D-Westminster, and Angela Williams, D-Denver, plan to be back next year with legislation to authorize the program.\Williams said most Coloradans can’t pay for extended leave. “We know that Coloradans every day have some kind of life event that could put them into financial stress, that can lead to unemployment and just snowball into a lot of other items that doesn’t create an economically good working environment here in Colorado,” she said.\ Polis’ pupils \Polis vowed in his campaign to make a big splash in his first 100 days. As the session neared its end, he said he was “very proud of what we accomplished in the first 100 days.”\He pointed to one of his biggest pledges — funding of full-day kindergarten. Next year’s budget allots $175 million to ensure all-day kindergarten is available and free across the state this fall.\“Unlike a lot of things in government that seem slow, we’re talking about a few months from now,” Polis said, though some question whether schools will be ready in time.\Higher education also will see a budget increase next year, allowing the schools to hold tuition costs flat.\ A defused sex-ed bill \Lawmakers also passed House Bill 1032, a stripped-down version of the sex education bill that was introduced on the session’s first day and generated angry opposition and dozens of hours of hearings with hundreds of witnesses.\The bill was rewritten Thursday to delete some of the most controversial language, but it retained its core provisions on teaching consent and closing a loophole used by some schools to teach “abstinence-only” curriculum, which is barred under a 2013 law.\During the bill’s final moments in the Senate, Republican Leader Chris Holbert of Parker spoke to opponents outside the Capitol, some from Colorado Christian University and the Catholic Church, telling them to be sure they look at the new version, not one from two months ago.\Coram, the Montrose Republican senator, said he took “a lot of arrows” over his co-sponsorship of the bill, but it was the right thing to do. The Senate approved the much abbreviated measure on a 21-14 vote Friday. The House later OK’d the amendments and approved the bill 40-23.\ Movement on transportation \After last fall’s defeat of two ballot questions to finance transportation improvements, lawmakers tried various ways to fund the Colorado Department of Transportation’s 10-year, $9 billion projects wish list.\That included failed attempts to swap the state gas tax for a new sales and use tax and to tap into the general fund.\The good news is that transportation will see more than $300 million extra from the state budget next year. The bad news is that most of that is one-year funding, with dwindling gas tax revenues keeping the state falling farther behind growth.\Polis, nonetheless, said the $300 million for roads showed “the commitment of Democrats and Republicans to do everything we can with the resources we have to reduce traffic and promote safety. Obviously, any long-term solutions would likely go before the voters.\“They didn’t bond with new revenue. They didn’t want a sales tax. They said, ‘Do more,’ and this Legislature has really stepped up, and we’re very supportive of that.”\ New way to pick presidents \Democrats decided to commit the state to a new system of casting its Electoral College votes.\Senate Bill 42, which Polis signed in mid-March, commits Colorado electors to vote for whomever wins the national popular vote, regardless of who wins the state vote.\That’s assuming enough other states approve identical legislation to make a difference in the national outcome.\Republicans have attacked the measure, seeing it as a response to Donald Trump’s election in the Electoral College despite losing the national popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots to Democrat Hillary Clinton.\A petition drive is underway to halt the measure’s implementation pending results of a statewide referendum.\ Vaccinations bill dies \After hundreds of parents testified for and against a bill to toughen immunization reporting requirements, the Senate quietly let the bill die Thursday.\House Bill 1312 would have required parents or guardians who want to exempt their children from any vaccinations to fill out a state form rather than simply inform their local school.\The bill didn’t take away exemptions, but its goal was to increase children’s vaccination rate. Supporters said it was critical, given the national measles outbreak.\Polis, however, had said he might not sign the bill based on its requirement that parents obtain the form in person from a local health department or the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.\For a list of other bills that passed this session, visit gazette.com.\The Gazette’s Conrad Swanson contributed to this story.\Also passed in the 2019 session:• House Bill 1039, allowing transgender Coloradans to obtain new birth certificates instead of amended ones and easing rules to get such documents.\• HB 1106, barring landlords from charging rental application fees if they can’t prove they are used solely to process applications.\• HB 1110, setting up a task force to make recommendations on media literacy curriculum for elementary and secondary public education.\• HB 1124, blocking law enforcement from arresting an immigrant on federal orders without a court order.\• HB 1129, banning licensed mental health therapists from providing “conversion therapy” to gay youths.\• HB 1168, setting up a “reinsurance” program to help keep costs down for health insurance providers with high-cost claims.\• HB 1210, allowing local governments to set a minimum wage higher than that required by the state.\• HB 1216, capping the cost of insulin and authorizing the state to find out why the drug costs so much.\• HB 1224, requiring jails to provide free menstrual hygiene products to inmates.\• HB 1225, barring imposition of bail for various petty offenses and traffic cases.\• HB 1264, intended to increase transparency for the conservation easements program, which some landowners say has cost them hundreds of thousands of tax credit dollars.\• HB 1228, doubling state affordable housing tax credits to $10 million a year for five years.\• HB 1234, allowing home delivery of marijuana products.\• HB 1266, allowing felons to vote while on parole.\• HB 1327, asking voters to approve betting on sports events and to set a 10 percent tax to support water planning and combat gambling addiction.\• Senate Bill 7, adding guidelines and protections around sexual misconduct and violence at Colorado colleges.\• SB 100, allowing victims of revenge porn to seek civil damages.\• SB 139, opening more driver’s license offices to serve undocumented immigrants."
122,"Millions of dollars poured into campaigns for four ballot initiatives came to naught Tuesday, after grass-roots groups and lawmakers agreed to withdraw the initiatives from November election contention.\The initiatives, known as 88, 89, 121, and 137, targeted oil and gas development in Colorado and straddled both sides of the issue. They were at the heart of a last-minute compromise on Monday between advocacy groups and Gov. John Hickenlooper.\The governor asked that the ballot measures be dropped hours before groups planned to submit lists of signatures to the Colorado Secretary of State's Office on Monday. In exchange the state would back away from a lawsuit with the city of Longmont over its 2012 ban on hydraulic fracturing, a controversial oil and gas extraction technique.\The official withdrawal of all measures didn't happen until around 4 p.m. on Tuesday, when both groups signed official notarized letters declaring their intentions to withdraw their ballots. After holding out for hours on Monday, Rep. Frank McNulty, R-Highlands Ranch, finally agreed to withdraw 121, because it ultimately seemed the best way to defeat 88 and 89, he said Tuesday. Coloradans for Safe and Clean Energy, a group supporting 88 and 89, agreed to rescind its measures late Monday night.\Tuesday's announcement ended months of intense campaigning for both sides, in which donors tossed more than $10 million into consultants' fees, signature gathering and advertising. All groups were left with thousands -- in one case, millions -- of dollars in their coffers after their campaigns abruptly ended Tuesday, according to finance reports filed to the Secretary of State's Office last week.\Protecting Colorado's Environment, Economy and Energy Independence, the issue committee backed by the oil and gas industry, raised more than $9 million to combat restrictions to oil and gas development, according to finance records filed last week to the Secretary of State's Office. Andarko Petroleum and Noble Energy, two of Colorado's top oil and gas operators, were the biggest contributors to the campaign, collectively raising more than $4 million.\Coloradans for Safe and Clean Energy, backed by Democratic Congressman Jared Polis, raised more than $900,000 and spent around $270,000 in June and July just gathering signatures for initiatives 88 and 89, according to state finance records.\McNulty's group, Energy Bans Hurt Communities, was left with $36,919.34, which McNulty said will be used to round off legal and other campaign costs. Polis' group was left with $444,995.72 -- members did not return calls Tuesday to answer questions about their plans for the money. The industry-backed group, Protecting Colorado's Environment, was left with more than $3 million.\With Polis at his side, Hickenlooper announced the deal at a news conference on Monday. Reactions to his last minute move were mixed -- initially, grassroots groups refused to drop their ballot measures. Some were outraged by Polis' sudden change of heart, after the lawmaker raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to get signatures for 88 and 89.\The ballot measures were evenly split between oil and gas industry advocates and their opponents. Initiatives 88 and 89 would have changed setbacks between occupied buildings and wells to 2,000 feet, and amended the Colorado constitution, respectively. Initiative 121 would have guaranteed that oil and gas tax revenue goes only to communities without bans. Initiative 137 would have required fiscal impact considerations for all statutes.\In lieu of the four ballot measures being put to vote, Hickenlooper created an 18 person special commission of residents, politicians and industry representatives. The group will be charged with studying oil and gas development in Colorado.\The nascent commission's plans were still poorly formed on Tuesday, and even appointed-chair Gwen Lachelt knew very little about the task force's goals and timelines. The group will meet until the end of the year, with the goal of offering recommendations on oil and gas development to the legislature in 2015.\Sitting on the task force will be six local politicians and residents, six industry representatives and six ""respected Coloradans,"" said Lachelt, who is a La Plata county commissioner.\As of Tuesday, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, currently embroiled in a suit with Longmont, had not yet responded to the governor's request, but expects to discuss the issue this week. Lawsuits involving the Colorado Oil and Gas Association -- one of which includes Fort Collins -- will move forward, the association said on Monday."

124,"Label: AUTO DEALER NOTES\ According to CNN's election-night coverage, 91 percent of the automobile industry's political monetary support went to President Bush. Now that the voting is over, however, auto groups undoubtedly are examining what a Clinton administration will mean to them.\ The gas tax, the luxury tax, free-trade policies and CAFE standards were the principal automotive issues discussed by the candidates during their campaigns. The budget deficit and a sluggish economy, of course, were shared general concerns.\ President-elect Clinton opposes the Ross Perot-proposed 10-cent gas tax for the next five years, which was estimated to raise $158 billion. Perot planned to use these funds to create jobs and reduce the United States' dependence on foreign oil. Clinton countered Perot's proposal by saying the gas tax ""would be a burden on the middle class.""\ Clinton supported repeal of the luxury tax during his campaign and expressed mixed views on the North American Free Trade Agreement. In the last presidential debate, Clinton said he was ""in the middle"" of Bush and Perot on this issue, believing it does ""more good than harm if . ."" The ""ifs"" had to do with protection of the environment, Mexico enacting labor-law standards, and reinvestment in the U.S. economy by making a commitment to re-educate and retrain American workers who might lose their jobs.\ The combination of a President Clinton and a Democratic Congress worries those who liked Bush's open-trade policy. One auto executive says the real issue is not who the president is, but who sits in Congress. Another notes, however, that transplant companies, which arrived in the United States during the 1980s, have never operated under a Democratic president.\ The most visible industry issue during the campaign probably was the Corporate Average Fuel Economy. Both Bush and Perot opposed higher CAFE requirements primarily because they feared it would result in significant job losses. Clinton, on the other hand, supported an increase from the current 27.5 mpg to 45 mpg, stating this standard ""should be the goal of automakers and incorporated into national legislation."" In the final debate he emphasized the word ""goal"" in raising fuel-efficiency guidelines, stating he never said ""we should write it into law if there is evidence that goal cannot be achieved."" In fact, Clinton cited a study by the National Science Foundation that said it would be difficult to reach fuel-efficiency standards in excess of 37.5 mpg by the year 2000.\ The director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation believes the industry ""desperately needs a government that is going to be a little less focused on regulation"" and more attuned to the coordination of policies. He believes there is movement in that direction and that it seems to be ""reasonably bipartisan.""\ The automobile industry looks to the new administration with hope that Clinton's health-care reform and economic development plans work. It awaits President-elect Clinton's proposals for change, optimistic that they may include a harmonization of government policies so emissions, CAFE and safety can be improved.\ David Solon is president of the Colorado Springs Automobile Dealers Association."
125,"Fuel prices tied to economic volatility\As summer approaches and America moves into the peak driving season, the higher prices we pay at the gas pump will result in higher costs for Colorado's agriculture industry and on basic items such as groceries.\Recent estimates by the Energy Information Administration indicate that drivers can expect to pay an average of $1.76 per gallon of regular unleaded gas from April to September. That is up 20 cents from a year ago.\Motorists in Northern Colorado and along the Front Range can expect high prices throughout the summer, as well, partly due to additives included during refinement. Colorado requires the sale of oxygenated gasoline in the contiguous metropolitan areas from Fort Collins to Denver.\Ultimately, Americans will experience the consequences of increased fuel prices at the supermarket and at the mall, because nearly 80 percent of consumer goods are trucked around the country. With diesel fuel prices also on the rise, and expected to sell at 14 cents more per gallon than a year ago, we can expect higher costs for life's basic necessities.\Higher diesel fuel prices will further add to the burdens faced by farmers and ranchers who, in Colorado, are struggling with reduced productivity from years of severe drought.\Because gasoline is such a basic component in our nation's economic vitality, we must work to lower prices.\Over the past year, I have been fighting in Congress to prevent government-imposed gas price increases in the form of higher taxes. In April, the House passed a six-year highway construction bill that was originally slated to include a substantial increase in the federal gas tax.\I led a group of representatives who ensured this tax hike was not included in the final version of the bill, because we understand the trickle-down effects will cost families and businesses. Had I not succeeded, motorists would pay an immediate 5.4 cents per gallon more at the pump, an increase that would have also been yearly indexed to inflation.\It would be foolish for the federal government to exacerbate these problems with gas-tax increases.\It is no surprise America is heavily dependent upon foreign oil, and we predominately import from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.\Furthermore, because these OPEC countries frequently conspire to set limits on oil production, and gas prices in America are heavily dependent upon their decisions, great fluctuations in prices can occur rather quickly. Recent announcements by OPEC indicate that throughout the summer its member countries will cut oil production by 1.5 million barrels a day from the level of production of last March.\Should our ability as a nation to purchase oil from the OPEC cartel diminish or should they decide to further cut oil production, farmers and ranchers would face higher costs and, ultimately, families would find basic necessities more expensive.\In Congress, I have been fighting to pass legislation that will help reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil, such as the Energy Policy Act. Last year, the House passed this important legislation because it contains a balanced portfolio of measures to help conserve energy, as well as increase domestic production, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. In addition, this bill promotes a cleaner environment with tax credits for renewable energy and alternative-fueled vehicles.\In particular, this bill will benefit Colorado's corn growers because it expands the small-producer ethanol tax credit and allows cooperatives to receive the benefit. In addition, it extends the excise-tax exemption on ethanol.\In a letter to the president, I requested that he make passage of this legislation a high priority and to express to the nation the importance of a comprehensive national energy policy during his annual State of the Union Address.\The rising price of fuel should be a call for our nation to become more secure economically by stiffening our resolve to oppose raising the gas tax and becoming less dependent on foreign sources of fuel.\Marilyn Musgrave was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in January 2003, and she represents Colorado's 4th Congressional District.

The reason that fewer citizens as of late have been able to enjoy this local icon is our stinking economy, and after more than 5 years of the current federal administration (i.e., Barack Obama) no one could be more responsible for that dismal current state of affairs.\Hard working Americans of all backgrounds, ethnicities, and their communities, who are not continually tyrannized bounce back stronger than ever from such temporary setbacks. That is who we are and it is long past time for us to reclaim that heritage and identity as our own.\Let's be honest, the oppressive governments of our world regularly cause more destruction and human misery than any accumulation of natural disasters. If you are not sure of that fact, for crying out loud stop texting for two minutes and go educate yourself! Instead of having funds available to support a local taxpayer and employer we are forced to send them to Washington, D.C., one of the wealthiest locales in the entire world, where the officials we elect to represent us use our misappropriated resources to further entrench their redistributive, self-serving and parasitic malignancy that afflicts us, and worst of all whose misguided policies stand to propagate entire generations that know nothing of the life, liberty, and ability to pursue happiness which are our rights.\Tom Jennings, Colorado Springs\-\Nation's debt will be passed on\Our grand/great-grand children are going to ask, ""Grampy-grammy, why did you do this to us?"" They'll be talking about our nation's debt passed on to them. How could this happen to a great nation such as ours? The answer lies with gutless politicians who care more about getting re-elected than about what is best for our country.\How do we get out of the mess we are in? Not by taxing the rich (or the poor). Two actions need to be taken. First, the size and cost of the federal government must be reduced. Agencies, which have proven to be of little benefit, must be abolished. Department of Education, Department of Energy, Department of Commerce, and others fall into this category. Also agencies such as the Federal Highway Administration that spends billions passing federal gas tax money back to states from whom it is collected. Eliminate the federal gas tax and have the states collect the money.\Second, economic growth must be encouraged by elimination of many federal governmental regulations that are blocking the full development of our energy resources. Despite what some shallow sighted letter writers are saying about new coal mines, coal and natural gas offers us the opportunity to develop energy exporting industries that would solve our problem with balance of payments to foreign countries and create thousands of good paying jobs. There are many ways to eliminate dusty roads, and I have yet to see a train trailing a cloud of dust. Approve the Keystone Pipeline!\Voting true conservatives into political offices will restore the greatness of our country.\Dick Prosence, Meeker\-\Indoor shooting facility will be safe\In the recent article ""Colorado Springs City Council denies appeal to halt indoor shooting range,"" by Monica Mendoza, many people voiced their concern over the idea of building an indoor shooting facility in Colorado Springs. Even though building an indoor shooting facility is very uncommon, it is a safe idea for Colorado Springs.\Danger: This is the number one word people associate with shooting. Some people think of death and violence as soon as the word ""gun"" is mentioned. For these people, thinking of guns in a neighborhood environment would be appalling. However, this new Majestic Mountain Range will be incredibly safe. The building itself will be fitted with thick concrete walls and an insulated steel frame, protecting against stray bullets from exiting through the walls. The building will also include classrooms, allowing for the proper safety education of gun safety.\Also, nonmembers will not be allowed into this new facility. In order to become a member, shooters will have to pass strict safety checks and evaluations. Stringent government guidelines will be followed at all times in this new facility, as the company's liability could be damaged if they are not followed.\And finally, guns can bring danger, but they also bring safety. Why does the military carry around guns? Why do the security guards at schools carry them around? It is for their, as well as other people's, protection. Guns possess power. Indeed, this power can be used for bad intentions, but it can also be used for good intentions.\It is clear that this new shooting facility will be very safe. No one needs to worry about being in danger as this new company will do everything to remain safe.\Ethan Slater, Colorado Springs\-\'Improvements' could be detrimental\I believe that the current recreational land use plan of the Bear Creek watershed is beneficial and symbiotic to the cutthroat trout. Despite individuals and agencies best intentions, the very acts of ""improvement"" to the area, in my opinion, will be detrimental to the habitat of the trout. Activities such as dredging to develop pools and waterfalls, cutting into the riparian steam areas, using hydraulic and motorized devices such as bobcats and tampers as well as manual shoveling and picking will increase sediment into the creeks, raise water temperature and have a negative effect on the fish.\The very shallow black topsoil around the steam is held mainly by the roots of the grasses and cutting new trails and having many individuals working this area will destabilize the soil and increase the potential for sedimentation into the creek. There is a reason the fish have existed in this area for years and the variables of food supply and habitat are not well understood but appear to be beneficial and favorable for this fish. I believe that Alternative A, with the exception of reopening High Drive, is the best option. The heavy equipment, vehicle traffic and activity to repair the flood damaged road may increase stress and sediment in the area and damage the stable environment which the fish have existed in for years.\Jim Heidelberg, Colorado Springs\Credit: Letters"

State Rep. Perry Buck, R-Windsor, has pledged to bring back an effort to pay for dozens of road projects across the state, including the expansion of I-25 from Loveland to Johnstown. The proposal has stalled twice in the past year, both in the 2016 legislative session and in an interim session. It's also one of what is sure to be several different proposals in the General Assembly, including an $8 billion package with some kind of new tax to pay for it.\Last year's pitch in a nutshell: The state would bond out up to $3.5 billion to pay for roadwork throughout Colorado. The state's existing 22-cent tax on each gallon of gasoline sold would then cover bond repayment.\Buck said she'd support other options -- adding that this isn't a partisan issue as much as a state of Colorado issue -- but couldn't get behind raising the state sales or gas tax.\Democrats think the accounting doesn't quite add up. Rep. Jeni Arndt, D-Fort Collins, said the gas tax is ""dying"" as more people drive fuel-efficient cars. And if the gas tax won't cover bond obligations, she thinks an already strained state general fund will be plundered.\""If we take a bond and pay it back through the general fund, that comes directly from K-12,"" Arndt said.\House Republicans and Democrats appear poised to fight again over how to pay for transportation this session. Speaker Crisanta Duran, D-Denver, said in her opening remarks to the session that she hopes to ask voters to sign off on a plan that ""won't take funding from schools,"" while minority leader Patrick Neville, R-Castle Rock, repeated the GOP mantra of Colorado having a spending problem, not a revenue problem -- signaling a hard stance against new taxes in favor of ""greater fiscal responsibility,"" even if it means spending is cut elsewhere.\Ultimately, transportation, like a great many things in the Capitol, will be determined by navigating and negotiating over Colorado's fiscal policy, Colorado State University political science professor John Straayer said. Limitations chiefly imposed by the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights mean any number of things could happen, from a bond proposal like Buck's to asking voters for a new tax to to ensure dedicated cash for the projects. Or maybe it will just be additional and more costly toll roads, Straayer said.\""I don't know that there's another way to get anything done in this,"" he said.\State Sen. John Kefalas, a Fort Collins Democrat, said he is willing to fight for multimodal options in any transportation bill, which would include building rail from Fort Collins to Denver.

It's unclear what will replace the federal law, or what kind of timeline the process may have. Regardless, any change to that could have potentially dramatic affects on hospitals, insurance companies and health care prices.\""We're all kind of wondering what's going to happen in the month or less, or 100 days,"" Ginal said at a recent town hall. ""We know there's going to be some kind of repeal or reform.""\Colorado, which runs its own exchange, is in better shape than those relying on the national exchange when it comes to preserving health insurance for its residents, she said. Ginal also acknowledged that the Connect for Health Colorado marketplace, the state exchange system, lacks competition to keep rates reigned in.\Meanwhile, Grantham said at the start of the session that a bill to repeal the exchanges will be one of the first priorities. Given the split control of the General Assembly and a Democratic governor, that is unlikely to happen.\Ginal also plans a new version of a bill that died last session that would increase transparency in prescription pharmaceutical prices, which she hopes would drive down or at least stabilize prescription drug prices. Last year's version would have required a cost analysis be released for treatments that cost $50,000 or more. This year, she wants the state Division of Insurance to release payout data that shows how much Coloradans spend on prescription drugs.\Ginal also put out the idea of making it legal for Coloradans to travel to Mexico or Canada to purchase prescriptions, a practice that is illegal under federal law. Not that federal prohibitions stopped Colorado from legalizing marijuana.\Kefalas wants to take aim at free-standing emergency rooms. He said they can look like an urgent care, but carry the heavy costs of an emergency room.\He hopes to pass a two-year moratorium on the opening of new free-standing ERs while new rules to govern the facilities are hammered out.\Public safety\The black smoke billowing forth from certain diesel trucks survived restriction efforts last session by Rep. Joann Ginal, D-Fort Collins.\Ginal is rebranding the effort, which previously referred to the colloquial term ""rolling coal,"" as a set of restrictions on ""extreme exhibition of exhaust or smoke"" from vehicles. In her push last session, she said she didn't want to target modifications that allow light diesel trucks to blast exhaust plumes, only the behavior of the drivers who choose to direct the smoke at other drivers, cyclists or pedestrians.\Last year's bill created a $35 fine and added points to the driver's license if soot-shooting was used to obscure roadways.

129,"""Should both pass, I believe the courts will need to determine which takes precedent.""\Amy Ford\CDOT spokeswoman\If you've driven Colorado's highways within the last year, you've likely cursed under your breath while sitting in stop-and-go traffic from Fort Collins to Denver, up to the mountains along Interstate 70 or even from Colorado Springs to Denver.\Just about anywhere you go in Colorado, you're probably driving on roads that haven't kept up with population growth and the daily traffic load. On that, there's little disagreement.\But how the state should pay for needed transportation infrastructure is up for debate this election season.\Propositions 109 and 110, dueling measures on the November ballot, would address the state's transportation needs in different ways if approved by voters.\One depends on a tax increase. The other takes the money from the state's general fund.\One fixes only state highways. The other fixes highways and funnels money to cities and towns to deal with their own transportation needs and improvements to multimodal transportation, such as bike lanes.\The Colorado Department of Transportation, or CDOT, has identified an annual $1 billion funding shortfall needed to meet the state's transportation needs, including widening Interstate 25. Colorado cities and towns have another $750 million in maintenance needs for municipal streets and bridges, according to the Colorado Municipal League.\Colorado's 22-cent-per-gallon gas tax, which helps fund transportation projects, hasn't been raised since 1991. And it won't keep up with the state's projected population, which is expected to double by 2050, the Colorado Transportation Commission said in a statement.\Between the funds CDOT gets from the gas tax and 36 percent of vehicle registration fees, Colorado drivers pay, on average, $211 per year to fund transportation, according to CDOT, which analyzed Propositions 109 and 110. As a state agency, however, it did not take a position on either ballot question.\Polling indicated a lack of statewide support for raising the gas tax, so transportation advocates sought other funding mechanisms, said Fort Collins Area Chamber of Commerce President and CEO David May. The chamber, which has been working to secure funding to widen north I-25 for five years, backs both initiatives.\The Colorado Municipal League, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that represents the interests of 270 cities and towns, supports 110.\""It is imperative that a comprehensive solution be taken now to ensure our state's commuters, residents and the millions that visit Colorado experience the same quality of life we have come to expect here,"" CML wrote in an endorsement of 110.\If you need an easy way to remember which is which, here's a mnemonic device:\Nine is No tax: Proposition 109 requires no tax.\Ten is a Tax: Proposition 110 requires a tax.\What would it do? Prop 109 would authorize up to $3.5 billion in bonding authority to be paid back over 20 years with money from the state's general fund. Introduced by Jon Caldara's Independence Institute, the money would only fund improvements to state highways and bridge expansion.\What projects get funding?The proposition lays out 66 specific funding projects.\How would Northern Colorado benefit? Widening I-25 from Colorado Highway 7 near Erie to Colorado Highway 14 in Fort Collins; reconfiguring and improving the U.S. Highway 34-U.S. Highway 85 interchange in Greeley.\Who is backing it? City of Colorado Springs, Fort Collins Area Chamber of Commerce, Independence Institute\Key arguments for it: It does not raise sales taxes, which is politically viable, and it requires a commitment from the Legislature to pay the bonds through the state's general fund.\Key arguments against it: It falls short of the funding needed for the targeted projects, which CDOT estimates would cost $5.6 billion. In the end, it would provide only a $2 billion net increase over current requirements, even though $3.5 billion is bonded, because it replaces $1.5 billion in existing state funding for CDOT.\Who is financing the campaign? As of the Sept. 12 campaign filing deadline, Fix Our Damn Roads had raised $431,436, with all but $100 of that coming from cash and in-kind donations from the Independence Institute.\What would it do? Raise the state's sales tax an additional 0.62 percentage points, or 62 cents on a $10 purchase. It would generate up to $767 million in the first year and allow the state to bond up to $6 billion to pay for transportation projects around the state. The funds would be divided between state highways, cities, counties and a dedicated multimodal fund.\The state's sales tax rate is currently 2.9 percent. Prop 110 would bring it to 3.52 percent, in addition to local and county taxes. Fort Collins' sales tax, including state taxes, is currently 7.3 percent; with Proposition 110, it would be 7.92 percent.\Of the total raised, 45 percent would be used by CDOT for statewide projects; 20 percent would be funneled to city governments, 20 percent would go to county governments and 15 percent would be used to fund multimodal projects throughout the state. The tax sunsets in 20 years.\What projects get funding?The Transportation Commission has adopted a $7 billion list of 111 projects that would be funded through the tax.\How would Northern Colorado benefit? Three projects are included that directly benefit Weld and Larimer counties, including widening parts of I-25 from Colorado Highway 66 near Longmont to Colorado Highway 402 south of Loveland and from Colorado 402 to Colorado 14 in Fort Collins.\Who is backing it? Fort Collins Area Chamber of Commerce, Colorado Municipal League, Colorado Transportation Commission, dozens of cities and counties, Denver South Economic Development Partnership, Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce.\Key arguments for it: Because it raises the sales tax, the burden is shared by residents and visitors to Colorado. It shares the funds with municipalities and counties and provides money for transit/bicycle/pedestrian uses. It also preserves $1.5 billion in existing state funding for CDOT, resulting in a $7 billion net increase over current requirements.\Key arguments against it: It's a sales tax and pushes some cities, like Colorado Springs, to a higher tax burden than they feel comfortable with, said Mayor John Suthers.\Colorado Springs passed its own 0.62 percent sales tax increase three years ago to fix roads. Adding another 0.62 percent sales tax would bring its sales tax to 8.87 percent. ""Getting close to 9 percent doesn't sit well,"" Suthers said.\If 110 passes, Suthers said his city likely won't ask its voters to renew its sales tax increase when it comes up for renewal in two years. Colorado Springs would end up trading about $400 million for local road construction for about $20 million funded through 110, he said.\If 110 passes, cities and counties may lose their flexibility to add sales tax initiatives for local projects, Suthers said.\Who is financing the campaign? As of the Oct. 1 campaign finance report, Coloradans for Coloradans, the committee registered to support Proposition 110, had raised $5.1 million, with the largest support coming from the Colorado construction industry, Kiewit Infrastructure Co. of Englewood, Visit Denver, KP Financial Services, National Association of Realtors and the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce.\If neither proposition passes, the state will revert to Senate Bill 1, passed in this year's legislative session, which authorizes a 2019 ballot measure that would ask for bonding authority of about $3 billion to be repaid by the general fund over 20 years.\This is where it gets complicated. The two propositions would work together for the most part, meaning there would be additional revenue for transportation projects, said Amy Ford, a CDOT spokeswoman.\But the two conflict in one specific area. Proposition 109 (no tax) eliminates the third and fourth year of transportation funding — about $1.5 billion — set aside by Senate Bill 267, passed by the Legislature in 2017.\Proposition 110 (tax) does not eliminate those dollars. ""Should both pass, I believe the courts will need to determine which takes precedent,"" Ford said.\Also, Ford said, ""should both pass we will need to go back and do a full analysis of the dollars available from 109,"" look at the overlap with Proposition 110 projects, how much additional money would be needed to fund all Proposition 109 projects, where money might be shifted to other priority projects that are not included in the Proposition 110 list, Ford said.\Proposition 109 has a specific list of 66 projects that total $5.6 billion, she said, while Proposition 110 funds projects already approved by the Colorado Transportation Commission.\""It would be a challenge,"" Ford said.\Local government and business leaders from Larimer and Weld counties have successfully been working on getting funding to improve north I-25 for nearly five years.\The group has secured about $590 million in funding to add a climbing lane on southbound north 1-25, new bridges and interchange improvements at Crossroads Boulevard, and an additional lane between Colorado 14 and Colorado 402.\But fixing the issue will require adding two lanes each way between Longmont and Fort Collins, at a price of about $1.7 billion.\""In an environment of limited money, the only way north I-25 could be completed would be by helping the state solve its transportation funding problem,"" the chamber stated in endorsing both initiatives.\Sales tax rates\The list below shows what the new sales tax rates of various Colorado cities would be if Proposition 100 were to pass, adding a 0.62 percent tax to existing state, county, city and special districts.

130,"Label: EDITORIALS\ President Clinton has not only backed away from Candidate Clinton's promised middle-class tax cut, but he has floated the possibility of raising gasoline taxes, which, of course, would hit middle and lower-income earners the hardest.\ Oh, well, the president has at least become an equal-opportunity taxer: He remains consistent in his belief that the rich should pay more in income taxes.\ On the latter issue, in a weekend radio broadcast, Clinton recently explained: ""Those who got the most and gave the least during the past dozen years"" should pay more.\ Thus, the New Democrat has bought, hook, line, and sinker, the Old Democrats' characterization of the '80s as a decade of greed - a moral and a factual distortion.\ Where was the president during the booming 1980s? How did he miss seeing the entrepreneurs who worked 18-hour days to create 20 million new jobs? Their profits were their just reward for creating industries and jobs.\ The 1981 and 1986 Reagan tax cuts encouraged the ""rich"" to make money by investing and creating jobs. This broadened the tax base, allowing the rich to pay more because they made more. There is more than ample evidence that, in fact, the ""rich"" paid more than their ""fair share"" in the last decade.\ Federal Reserve Board Governor Lawrence Lindsey reported only last month that the federal government netted $45.2 billion more in income taxes in 1988 than in 1981 - but the wealthiest 1 percent actually paid $50.2 billion more. Reported The New York Times: ""In short, the top 1 percent paid the entire increase in tax payments - and then some. The not-so-rich. . .got a $5 billion tax cut."" (The data came from the Democrat-controlled Congressional Budget Office.)\ ""So,"" asked the Times, ""how did the rich end up paying a bigger share of the U.S. tax bill? Their incomes surged, and that more than offset the lower rates."" Supply-side economics, though much derided by the Clintonites, has been vindicated. Cut tax rates, and both incomes and taxes on incomes will rise.\ Conversely, if Clinton raises the income tax rate on the wealthy, while imposing a gas tax on the middle class and the poor, he will hammer everyone. The rich, allowed to keep less of their earnings, will have less to invest in job creation. The middle-class and poor will have fewer jobs - and less after-tax money for such essentials as food and clothing for their children. Recession could return with a vengeance.\ It is envy that begrudges the wealthy their profits, and it is economic ignorance that fails to see that the rich become so by investing their wealth, by creating new wealth, which supports both the private economy and the government.\ Reap the harvest under the sea\ So maybe the joke in the Stuart Anderson commercials about those ""wily crustaceans"" raised by ""the lobster ranchers"" will come true after all. The California Fish and Game Commission approved separate plans recently for a commercial kelp forest and a mussel farm off the Southern California coast.\ Since offshore drilling platforms attract fish and other sea life, and with commercial salmon farms taking up some of the slack after some wild rivers were dammed, can lobster ranches be that far into the future?\ Most beachgoers view kelp as strictly a nuisance, but it produces algin, a substance used for thickening ice cream and preventing clothing dyes from running together. Some people swear by it as a food.\ Mussels are - depending on your taste - good to eat. Harvesting them 120 yards off the shore has got to be less expensive than standard fishing practices. California officials are concerned that mussels raised so close to humanity will absorb bacteria from pollutants.\ But what if all the coast off Southern California is declared a marine preserve, as some advocate? Will such commercial projects then be verboten?\ That's not an idle concern. Underwater farming is a growing field, and it makes sense to permit people the freedom to explore the possibilities. Many commercially useful substances can be found only - or produced most efficiently - under the sea. And undersea commercial activities could furnish information, techniques, and technologies that can be applied to intelligent preservation of undersea environments.\ The best way to encourage such activity would be to find a way to formalize private property rights under the sea, of course. That might be unlikely, but at least we should avoid forbidding efforts to make that portion of nature's bounty that resides underwater available to human beings."

Removing these agencies would free up money for repairs and new roads. Use cash reserves for projects and work harder to obtain more federal funds.\State's role in preserving open space, protecting the air and cleaning up toxic materials:\Colorado Springs doesn't have a serious problem with its air quality. State is within its rights to make laws controlling the disposal of toxic materials and to set standards for a clean environment. But enforcement should come at the city and county level. All three levels of government - federal, state and local - should work to preserve open space although it's mainly a city and county responsibility.\State's role in providing choice for parents of schoolchildren:\State should have the right to consider laws that broaden ability of parents to have choice on where they send their children to school.

Open-space preservation and park grants from Great Outdoors Colorado should continue.\State's role in providing choice for parents of schoolchildren:\State's role should be to continue to set minimum standards and to fund schools.

132,"Bob McCluskey\Question 1: What is the most important issue facing District 52 and how do you plan to address it?\Answer: The economy and lack of enough higher-paying jobs. The national economic crisis is hurting families in House District 52. We need to create new higher-paying jobs for hardworking citizens in Fort Collins.\I have passed legislation before, and would again, to strengthen and increase flexibility in job-reskilling opportunities.\I would carry legislation to invest in clean-energy technology. In House District 52, we have a unique chance to build upon the cutting-edge research being done in the district at the small engines lab on North College Avenue. As we develop new technologies for the new energy economy, we must capitalize on the potential to create more good-paying jobs in Fort Collins.\We need to create an environment to help entrepreneurs prosper by cutting any unnecessary red tape.\Question 2: What is the most important issue facing Fort Collins and how do you plan to address it?\Answer: We need to find new ways to stimulate the Fort Collins economy.\When I was on the Fort Collins City Council from 1993 to 1997, we often talked about how important the current quality of life was to the citizens of Fort Collins. I believe that a good quality of life starts with a good job.\To enable companies currently in Fort Collins and those that would potentially come to create additional good jobs, we must do more to develop a business-friendly environment.\I support keeping our tax burden low so companies would be more able to expand jobs in Fort Collins.\I would support further reductions in the burdensome business personal property tax.\I would look for new and innovative strategies to support our small businesses and then get government out of the way.\Question 3. What can be done about transportation along the Interstate 25 corridor between Denver and Northern Colorado?\Anwser: The transportation system on I-25 from Fort Collins to Denver is more than just highway miles or mass transit. It's about bringing shoppers to our local stores. It's about allowing our local manufacturers to get their goods to market. It's about enabling our people to look into job possibilities outside of Fort Collins.\To improve our current transportation system we will need to find more resources on a sustainable basis. Clearly an improved economy would be able to provide part of the needed dollars.\Another potential strategy would be to develop a new ballot proposal. First, we would need to undertake a new statewide grassroots effort to determine if the citizens of Colorado agree that we have a system that needs additional funding. During that process we need to engage people on what is the right balance between more road capacity improvements or more mass transit projects.\With the results drawn from the grassroots process we could then move forward with a sustainable long-term solution for our transportation system.\Question 4: What economic issue affecting Fort Collins concerns you the most and what can the state do to address that issue?\Answer: Lack of enough primary jobs and underemployment. Fort Collins lost many jobs in the economic downturn during the early 2000s. Of those jobs, higher-paying jobs with benefits were slower to return when the economy grew. We have gained more jobs back than lost during that period but at a lower average income.\Initially, the state Legislature should make more funding available for job reskilling. This would enable existing companies in Fort Collins to hire locally and new companies to have the skilled work force they need.\Next, the Legislature should reduce the business personal property tax. In a changing economy, many businesses must be able to change their manufacturing equipment frequently. This tax puts Colorado companies at an unfair position to compete in national and international markets.\The state should also increase funding for basic research in renewable energy at CSU. This would enhance opportunities for new startups and good jobs available in Fort Collins.\Question 5. Considering the lack of higher education funding in Colorado, what can be done to address that concern to ensure CSU best serves Fort Collins?\The current Colorado budget structure dictates that when state revenues decline that the first cuts and typically the largest cuts come from higher education.\To combat the current situation I support establishing a reserve or rainy day fund in the Colorado budget. I supported this concept when in the Legislature and still feel that unless we take proactive steps that we will lose the ability to provide a reasonable level of service to our citizens in good and bad budget years. By setting up this fund in good years we can live within the dollars we have to provide a more consistent funding base.\Beyond the base, I would support a coalition of all institutions of higher education coming together to develop a plan to educate our children for the new economy and what additional resources would be necessary to achieve that goal. In developing this plan I feel that we must find other means of new revenue other than on the backs of current and future students.\We must remember that the potential for new job creation and opportunities for our children in Northern Colorado will be heavily influenced by our ability to find a better, more sustainable, funding source for C.S.U.\Question 6. What sets you apart from your opponent?\Initially, I am different from my opponent by growing up in Fort Collins and graduating from the Poudre R-1 School District. After receiving my undergraduate and MBA from Stanford University I returned to the family small business, Poudre Valley Creamery. A major difference is that I worked in the private sector for 30 years during which I created jobs, purchased healthcare for our employees, and met a budget.\I am also the only one in our race to be elected to a public office in Fort Collins. Besides being elected to the Fort Collins City Council, I have served as the chairman of the Fort Collins Parks and Recreation Board, Poudre Fire Authority and Economic Development Subcommittee of the UniverCity Connections. In each of these positions I had to represent all voices in the community and not just one viewpoint.\In my two terms in the Colorado House of Representatives I carried and passed important legislation for Fort Collins. In working on important issues pertaining to police impersonation, Internet predators, and hospital infection reporting I was able to truly reach across the aisle and work hand in hand with both Republican and Democratic legislators to pass legislation that impacts Fort Collins citizens.\Lastly, I have been fortunate to be able to reach back into the community as new issues surfaced in the Legislature. Drawing upon people I have known through business, public and private boards, and social acquaintances has given me a beneficial insight into the consequences of legislation on the people of Fort Collins.\John Kefalas\(Kefalas provided a combined response for the questions.)\Questions:\1. What is the most important issue facing District 52 and how do you plan to do to address it?\2. What is the most important issue facing Fort Collins and how do you plan to do to address it?\3. What can be done about transportation along the Interstate 25 corridor between Denver and Northern Colorado?\4. What economic issue affecting Fort Collins concerns you the most and what can the state do to address that issue?\5. Considering the lack of higher education funding in Colorado, what can be done to address that concern to ensure CSU best serves Fort Collins?\6. What sets you apart from your opponent?\h3>\Answer to 1), 2) & 4) : The most important issue facing District 52, Fort Collins, Colorado and the United States is the economic meltdown we are currently experiencing. I feel it in my own family. The job market is uncertain. Health care costs are rising rapidly. Banks are failing. People are losing their homes. And now we're bailing out Wall Street.\In the state legislature, we've passed laws to promote sustainable economic development, and it is working. Fort Collins is weathering the storm better than the state as a whole, which is outperforming the US economy. Stimulating a New Energy Economy by supporting the clean technologies of the future and opening the market to utility-scale solar energy development is creating over 8,000 new jobs and spurring $700 million in private investments in the last two years alone in Colorado. We made $26.5 million available for universities like CSU and promising start-up companies to help move new technologies out of the lab and into the marketplace. We cut the business personal property tax for 30,000 small businesses, making it easier for them to grow and create jobs. We realigned educational standards to meet the needs of a changing world economy, while investing in pre-schools, all-day kindergartens and higher education. We passed the American Dream Protection Act to help homeowners facing foreclosure stay in their homes.\But the work is unfinished. If I am re-elected, I will continue the fight to restore the Colorado Earned Income Tax Credit to reduce taxes on hard-working Coloradans while advancing an economic, job-creation agenda that reduces poverty and helps families get ahead. I will continue to promote comprehensive health care reform that relieves the burden on families and small businesses and reform that moves us towards quality, affordable health care for all. I will work to find new funding sources for transportation.

133,"Bob McCluskey\Question 1: What is the most important issue facing District 52 and how do you plan to address it?\Answer: The economy and lack of enough higher-paying jobs. The national economic crisis is hurting families in House District 52. We need to create new higher-paying jobs for hardworking citizens in Fort Collins.\I have passed legislation before, and would again, to strengthen and increase flexibility in job-reskilling opportunities.\I would carry legislation to invest in clean-energy technology. In House District 52, we have a unique chance to build upon the cutting-edge research being done in the district at the small engines lab on North College Avenue. As we develop new technologies for the new energy economy, we must capitalize on the potential to create more good-paying jobs in Fort Collins.\We need to create an environment to help entrepreneurs prosper by cutting any unnecessary red tape.\Question 2: What is the most important issue facing Fort Collins and how do you plan to address it?\Answer: We need to find new ways to stimulate the Fort Collins economy.\When I was on the Fort Collins City Council from 1993 to 1997, we often talked about how important the current quality of life was to the citizens of Fort Collins. I believe that a good quality of life starts with a good job.\To enable companies currently in Fort Collins and those that would potentially come to create additional good jobs, we must do more to develop a business-friendly environment.\I support keeping our tax burden low so companies would be more able to expand jobs in Fort Collins.\I would support further reductions in the burdensome business personal property tax.\I would look for new and innovative strategies to support our small businesses and then get government out of the way.\Question 3. What can be done about transportation along the Interstate 25 corridor between Denver and Northern Colorado?\Anwser: The transportation system on I-25 from Fort Collins to Denver is more than just highway miles or mass transit. It's about bringing shoppers to our local stores. It's about allowing our local manufacturers to get their goods to market. It's about enabling our people to look into job possibilities outside of Fort Collins.\To improve our current transportation system we will need to find more resources on a sustainable basis. Clearly an improved economy would be able to provide part of the needed dollars.\Another potential strategy would be to develop a new ballot proposal. First, we would need to undertake a new statewide grassroots effort to determine if the citizens of Colorado agree that we have a system that needs additional funding. During that process we need to engage people on what is the right balance between more road capacity improvements or more mass transit projects.\With the results drawn from the grassroots process we could then move forward with a sustainable long-term solution for our transportation system.\Question 4: What economic issue affecting Fort Collins concerns you the most and what can the state do to address that issue?\Answer: Lack of enough primary jobs and underemployment. Fort Collins lost many jobs in the economic downturn during the early 2000s. Of those jobs, higher-paying jobs with benefits were slower to return when the economy grew. We have gained more jobs back than lost during that period but at a lower average income.\Initially, the state Legislature should make more funding available for job reskilling. This would enable existing companies in Fort Collins to hire locally and new companies to have the skilled work force they need.\Next, the Legislature should reduce the business personal property tax. In a changing economy, many businesses must be able to change their manufacturing equipment frequently. This tax puts Colorado companies at an unfair position to compete in national and international markets.\The state should also increase funding for basic research in renewable energy at CSU. This would enhance opportunities for new startups and good jobs available in Fort Collins.\Question 5. Considering the lack of higher education funding in Colorado, what can be done to address that concern to ensure CSU best serves Fort Collins?\The current Colorado budget structure dictates that when state revenues decline that the first cuts and typically the largest cuts come from higher education.\To combat the current situation I support establishing a reserve or rainy day fund in the Colorado budget. I supported this concept when in the Legislature and still feel that unless we take proactive steps that we will lose the ability to provide a reasonable level of service to our citizens in good and bad budget years. By setting up this fund in good years we can live within the dollars we have to provide a more consistent funding base.\Beyond the base, I would support a coalition of all institutions of higher education coming together to develop a plan to educate our children for the new economy and what additional resources would be necessary to achieve that goal. In developing this plan I feel that we must find other means of new revenue other than on the backs of current and future students.\We must remember that the potential for new job creation and opportunities for our children in Northern Colorado will be heavily influenced by our ability to find a better, more sustainable, funding source for C.S.U.\Question 6. What sets you apart from your opponent?\Initially, I am different from my opponent by growing up in Fort Collins and graduating from the Poudre R-1 School District. After receiving my undergraduate and MBA from Stanford University I returned to the family small business, Poudre Valley Creamery. A major difference is that I worked in the private sector for 30 years during which I created jobs, purchased healthcare for our employees, and met a budget.\I am also the only one in our race to be elected to a public office in Fort Collins. Besides being elected to the Fort Collins City Council, I have served as the chairman of the Fort Collins Parks and Recreation Board, Poudre Fire Authority and Economic Development Subcommittee of the UniverCity Connections. In each of these positions I had to represent all voices in the community and not just one viewpoint.\In my two terms in the Colorado House of Representatives I carried and passed important legislation for Fort Collins. In working on important issues pertaining to police impersonation, Internet predators, and hospital infection reporting I was able to truly reach across the aisle and work hand in hand with both Republican and Democratic legislators to pass legislation that impacts Fort Collins citizens.\Lastly, I have been fortunate to be able to reach back into the community as new issues surfaced in the Legislature. Drawing upon people I have known through business, public and private boards, and social acquaintances has given me a beneficial insight into the consequences of legislation on the people of Fort Collins.\John Kefalas\(Kefalas provided a combined response for the questions.)\Questions:\1. What is the most important issue facing District 52 and how do you plan to do to address it?\2. What is the most important issue facing Fort Collins and how do you plan to do to address it?\3. What can be done about transportation along the Interstate 25 corridor between Denver and Northern Colorado?\4. What economic issue affecting Fort Collins concerns you the most and what can the state do to address that issue?\5. Considering the lack of higher education funding in Colorado, what can be done to address that concern to ensure CSU best serves Fort Collins?\6. What sets you apart from your opponent?\Answer to 1), 2) & 4) : The most important issue facing District 52, Fort Collins, Colorado and the United States is the economic meltdown we are currently experiencing. I feel it in my own family. The job market is uncertain. Health care costs are rising rapidly. Banks are failing. People are losing their homes. And now we're bailing out Wall Street.\In the state legislature, we've passed laws to promote sustainable economic development, and it is working. Fort Collins is weathering the storm better than the state as a whole, which is outperforming the US economy. Stimulating a New Energy Economy by supporting the clean technologies of the future and opening the market to utility-scale solar energy development is creating over 8,000 new jobs and spurring $700 million in private investments in the last two years alone in Colorado. We made $26.5 million available for universities like CSU and promising start-up companies to help move new technologies out of the lab and into the marketplace. We cut the business personal property tax for 30,000 small businesses, making it easier for them to grow and create jobs. We realigned educational standards to meet the needs of a changing world economy, while investing in pre-schools, all-day kindergartens and higher education. We passed the American Dream Protection Act to help homeowners facing foreclosure stay in their homes.\But the work is unfinished. If I am re-elected, I will continue the fight to restore the Colorado Earned Income Tax Credit to reduce taxes on hard-working Coloradans while advancing an economic, job-creation agenda that reduces poverty and helps families get ahead. I will continue to promote comprehensive health care reform that relieves the burden on families and small businesses and reform that moves us towards quality, affordable health care for all. I will work to find new funding sources for transportation. I will continue to protect our natural environment and water quality, which is also critical to our tourism, brewing and computer industries. Unlike my opponent, who supports damming the Poudre River for Glade Reservoir, one of my highest priorities is to protect the Poudre River flowing through the heart of Fort Collins.\I will keep working to bring well-paying jobs to Fort Collins and Colorado as a whole by supporting our P-16 educational systems.

We can't deny that infrastructure takes money — for materials, labor, engineering, equipment and maintenance. We have tax and bonding measures for transportation on this year's ballot, and will have bonding on the ballot next year if both fail. If any of these measures pass, we can do billions in near-term new construction. If they all fail, we must make do with our current constrained budget until we craft a solution, and I think it needs to address revenue. The state gas tax has lost purchasing power because it isn't indexed to inflation and more people are buying less fuel because they're driving fuel-efficient vehicles or electric cars. We could look at alternatives to the gas tax, like mileage-based fees. I don't believe we should fund transportation by raiding other state departments, because they have funding challenges of their own. I also don't prefer major bonding without new revenue, because bonding costs interest and we don't know when the next recession will hit.\How do you propose addressing the state's below-average per-pupil funding for its schools? Voters passed Amendment 23 in 2000 to better fund education, yet state funding is currently far below the Constitutional amendment's formula due in part to the Recession-era decision to create what was once called the ""negative factor."" As with infrastructure, we shouldn't deny that quality education costs money. I believe that if we want to address per-pupil funding, as posed in the question, we need some type of revenue solution. There is a tax measure on this year's ballot, and if passed it would really help address per-pupil funding. If it fails, the state budget process might still result in incremental increases for K-12 if Colorado continues with strong economic performance, or if we have windfalls like we did this year. However, these are not long-term solutions, and another recession could put us right back where we were during the last recession.\Beyond improving infrastructure and school funding, what do you see as the most pressing issues the state legislature should address? Environment, climate change, women's reproductive rights, public safety, oil and gas, health care, water, housing, homelessness, justice for all (regardless of race/ethnicity, sex/sexual identity, or class), an economy that works for everyone, access/affordability in higher education."
135,"DENVER - State transportation funding should be increased by $1.5 billion a year through a combination of fee increases and hikes in the state gas, sales and severance taxes, a panel appointed by Gov. Bill Ritter recommended Thursday. \The recommendation, which comes after eight months of meetings, now goes to Ritter, who must decide whether to push for the tax-increase proposals to be placed on the 2008 ballot. The firstyear Democratic governor is expected to receive similar requests from panels on health care and education and has said he will move forward with only one ballot issue next year. \Blue Ribbon Transportation Commission members also crafted alternative plans with spending increases of $500 million, $1 billion and $2 billion per year. They tabbed the $1.5 billion plan as the preferred option, saying that a $2 billion increase would be too much to ask of voters, but that anything smaller than $1.5 billion would not make a significant difference in the state's deteriorating system of funding transportation. \The Colorado Department of Transportation currently gets about $1 billion a year for roads and other needs. \""To me, an investment in transportation is probably first about safety and second about fiscal responsibility,"" said former Colorado Transportation Commissioner Dan Stuart, the only Pikes Peakarea resident on the panel. ""If we fail to invest now, we pay a whole lot more later. And I think both of those things are things El Paso County can understand."" \The panel was formed after gas-tax revenues that have funded state highways since 1931 began to decline in 2005, partly because of better fuel efficiency and more alternativefuel vehicles. It considered options that included increased tolls and establishing a cuttingedge fee-per-mile-driven program, but while it recommended studying the latter option, it suggested funding road needs immediately in more traditional ways. \Members recommended raising the 22 cents-per-gallon state gas tax by 13 cents per gallon and allowing it to grow yearly with inflation, increasing the 2.9 cent state sales tax by 0.35 cents and increasing the severance tax on companies that extract minerals from the ground by 1.7 percent. It also suggested the state increase vehicle registration fees by $100 a year and create a $6 daily ""visitors fee"" on hotel rooms and auto rentals. \About $538 million of the revenue would go to maintenance and safety efforts that would increase the quality of road surfaces, cut traffic congestion, fix shoulders and maintain bridges. Another $293 million would be go to local roads and streets, while $107 million would provide new funding for urban and rural transit, environmental needs and bike and pedestrian pathways. \The biggest chunk of the money -- $562 million -- would go toward mobility needs and would be divided up in the following way: \- About $60 million would be used to speed up construction of projects on major roads such as Interstate 25 and Powers Boulevard for which voters approved bonds in 1999. \- $251 million a year would go to interregional transit projects such as creating a Front Range commuter rail. \- $251 million would be put toward highway expansion or transit to help with the most congested highways in the state. \The biggest fight on the 32-person commission was about whether to put more of the mobility funding toward buses and trains or toward more driving lanes. \Panelist Mick Ireland, Aspen's mayor, argued that the plan must serve not just as a way to build blacktop but as a statement about how the panel thinks future transportation needs will be met through use of transit. \""The almost exclusive emphasis on highway capacity has failed us. It's failed our highway system, it's failed our environment, it's failed us fiscally,"" Ireland said. ""If it was working, we wouldn't need a blue-ribbon panel."" \But panel co-chairman Bob Tointon, a Greeley construction company executive who helped to steer the compromise of a 50/50 split, argued that voters would be slow to accept a tax package that put so much money toward a form of transportation that most don't use. \""I think we have to accept that we, regardless of how much money we put into transit, aren't going to have a transit system that a lot of people will use in the next 15 years,"" Tointon said. \CDOT Executive Director Russ George said staffers will put together a full report that will be available by the end of the year."
136," DENVER - Maintaining Colorado's highways and transportation systems will be one of the biggest challenges facing the state's next governor.\ The Colorado Department of Transportation's 2030 plan estimates the state is facing a roughly $48 billion shortfall in funds needed to maintain the transportation infrastructure in place. That doesn't begin to touch expansion of the system to deal with Colorado's growing number of drivers.\ To make matters worse, CDOT's stream of state funding has been all over the map in recent years. The agency saw its budget slashed 41 percent in three years during the recent recession, a trend that has been reversed in the past two years.\ Additionally, revenues from gasoline taxes across the nation and in Colorado -- one of the primary sources of highway funding -- aren't growing much, if at all, as vehicles begin to get better gas mileage.\ Colorado voters have telegraphed what they don't want -- highway projects financed by debt. In 2005, voters defeated Referendum D, which would have jump-started 55 strategic projects throughout the state by selling bonds.\ Democrat Bill Ritter supported Referendum D, and Republican Bob Beauprez did not.\ Beauprez and Ritter say they will make it a priority to solve the looming problem of how to maintain and expand Colorado's aging roads, highways and bridges.\ Beauprez has an aggressive proposal: get rid of the gas tax and in its place institute a roughly .8-cent increase in the state sales tax that would be dedicated to transportation spending.\ ""It would be universally equitable across the people of the state,"" Beauprez said. ""That would be a funding source that would increase as the economy grows, not decline as we currently have.""\ Some critics, however, are not convinced it is an equitable way to collect revenue. At least with the gas tax, the people who drive the most pay the most. Some critics charge that an across-the-board sales tax forces people who don't drive a lot to subsidize those who do.\ Ritter has not put out a formal plan for funding transportation. Instead, he's vowing to make it one of the top priorities of his administration.\ ""We have to find a sustainable way to go forward,"" he said. ""I have committed to appointing a commission in the first 90 days that will... put all funding streams on the table. They can look at the ones that are best and come back to me and make recommendations about how we go forward.""\ Part of the new commission's role would be to hold a transportation summit to help collect ideas from across the state.\ One of the transportation areas where Beauprez and Ritter split paths is on how best to address traffic on Interstate 70, the main link between the Front Range and mountain resorts. I-70, usually clogged during summer and winter weekends, is key to the state's $7 billion-a-year ski industry.\ Ritter wants to ensure any improvements to I-70 include some form of mass transit -- a train, a monorail or some other solution.\ ""We must design projects that improve mobility, honor the environment and protect the livability of adjacent communities,"" Ritter says on the campaign Internet site. ""I believe we need to preserve a transit envelope as part of a long-term I-70 transportation solution.""\ Beauprez, however, takes a different approach. He wants to look for a new way to move people into the mountains, shifting the focus from I-70 as the main artery. I-70, he says, just doesn't have enough room for expansion even if improvements are made.\ ""Pushing more and more into just a little bit larger mouth of the same funnel is not a solution,"" he said. ""I think it is time we look at other pathways, a second corridor, and see if we can't identify one and come up with a funding mechanism to get it built.""\ CONTACT THE WRITER: 1-303-837-0613 or kyle.henley@gazette.com\ ONLINE > Getting there\ You can view the transportation plans offered by gubernatorial candidates Bob Beauprez and Bill Ritter by visiting their campaign Web sites:\ www.ritterforgovernor.com/issuesTR.cfm\ www.bobbeauprez.com/issues/bob_beauprez_on _transportation.asp</ picture>"
137,"Gov. John Hickenlooper and Don Hunt, executive director of the Colorado Department of Transportation, have done a great job in scraping together and freeing up state funds for transportation improvements. They came through again Friday.\Hickenlooker and Hunt unveiled a plan called Responsible Acceleration of Maintenance and Partnerships (RAMP), and it means Coloradans will see accelerated availability of $300 million each year in transportation funding for the next five years.\It spells opportunity for much-needed improvements in and near Colorado Springs, but politicians throughout the region will have to defend our interests.\""Very optimistic this region is going to benefit,"" said Les Gruen, who represents this region on the Colorado Transportation Commission.\The program contains the word ""acceleration"" because this is not money in addition to anything we had ultimately planned for. The funding comes from pent-up state funds we did not anticipate using soon because transportation officials were building up a reserve.\The reserve was needed because Congress, throughout the recession, has placed the future of the federal gas tax in question.\In July, after a series of short-term extensions, Congress passed a two-year extension of the Surface Transportation Act - which determines how much funding states receive - and a four-year extension of the gas tax.\The more permanent extensions of federal funding mean Hickenlooper and transportation officials are less interested in building and maintaining reserves and more comfortable embarking on urgent projects.\The challenge for Colorado Springs will involve obtaining a fair share of the funding in a state political environment that heavily favors the I-70 corridor through Denver and ski country.\As RAMP was announced, eight proposals were viewed at a Department of Transportation technology forum for building high-speed transit through the I-70 mountain corridor as a means of easing congestion. These are not proposals that would tap RAMP funds, but talk of monorails and magnetic levitation systems underscore the heavy attention paid to a corridor that CDOT data show as less congested than I-25.\Colorado Springs Mayor Steve Bach had a conference call Friday morning with Hunt and Gruen. Bach reminded them of four pressing transportation needs in Colorado Springs that could benefit greatly from early availability of funds. He also reminded them that voters here just extended a tax to fund the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority, which means we are using local money to pay for a lot of work that might otherwise put strain on state transportation funds. He believes extension of the regional transportation tax should benefit the Pikes Peak region, because transportation officials are placing emphasis on the need for public/private partnerships in regard to distribution of RAMP funds.\Bach urged Gruen and Hunt to make high priority the need for major improvements at I-25 and Cimarron, I-25 and Fillmore, Powers and Old Ranch Road, and Powers and Steward.\""I think I got a very positive response,"" Bach told The Gazette. ""I wanted to confirm that these are urgent priorities. These locations all pose urgent public safety risks. While I received a positive response in our conversation, I do not have firm commitments yet.""\We thank Hickenlooper and Hunt for improving state government's ability to build and maintain Colorado roads and bridges, which are essential to our state's ability to grow and prosper. We thank Mayor Bach for never ceasing to defend the needs of this city and the surrounding region.\Bach and Gruen cannot get the results we need all by themselves. State and local politicians throughout the Pikes Peak region should go out of their way to advocate for our fair share of transportation funds, especially given Friday's announcement of RAMP."

World class highway system is vital to Colorado.
\
Guillermo Vidal
\
Creating a Transportation system that ensures our quality of life for generations to come is one of the biggest challenges facing our state. In order to maintain Colorado's economy as the best in the nation, our transportation solutions must go beyond fixing potholes and laying more asphalt. We must be bold in our vision and strategic with our actions. The transportation system we develop must help us preserve our environment, yet at the same time enable economic development and quality growth for our communities. The system must safely and efficiently move people and goods while accommodating the special needs of tourism and agriculture.
\
There are many unanswered questions as we look to the future. For example, how do we juggle funding in order to properly maintain our roads and bridges, expand their capacity and make them safer? Should we build light rail, bikeways or other modal facilities with the funding that has traditionally gone to expanding and repairing our highways? How do we meet the changing mobility needs of our growing urban and rural areas?
\
Clearly we must work together to create a cohesive transportation vision for Colorado in order to answer these questions. This is what Governor Romer calls a ""smart growth"" policy. He is challenging us to dream for our state a 20, 30 and even 50 year future. He is laying forth a plan that will enable us to create a better Colorado for our children. However, in order to prepare ourselves to make these decisions for our future, we must understand the current status of our transportation infrastructure.
\
A great misconception exists among our citizens that there is plenty of funding to invest in our roads. Coloradans do pay a 20 cent per gallon tax which is the 11th highest gasoline tax in the nation. However, most states supplement their gas tax with general fund revenues and sales taxes in order to fund their transportation needs. Colorado uses only gasoline tax revenues to fund transportation improvements, making our cost per person one of the lowest in the nation. In fact, Colorado's funding for its transportation needs has been diminishing over the years. Nevertheless, many citizens complain we ought to have adequate funding to prevent our roads from being in such disrepair.
\
Why are roads in such poor condition? The main reason is most of our highways were built in the 1960's and 70's and are either close to or have exceeded their 20-year design life. There is simply not enough funding available to address every road in need of reconstruction. The second reason is perhaps more subtle, but it has had a no less devastating effect on our roads. Because of our growing economy, every region of our state has experienced considerable growth. This has resulted in a much higher use of our highway system. In fact, during Governor Romer's tenure, use of our highway system has gone up 21%. The state's population has grown 10% and the number of registered vehicles has risen by 11%.
\
Compounding the problem is the fact the amount of funding available to meet these demands has decreased by more than 14% since 1987. Newer cars get much better gas mileage so the amount of money we get from gas tax has actually gone down. Additionally, Colorado gets much less in federal funding than in the mid-1980's. We have more people, more vehicles, more miles being traveled on our roads, and less money than ever to deal with our transportation problems.
\
Has our state government been slow in addressing these problems? Is there ANYTHING we can do to improve conditions in spite of these problems? The fact is, we have been working to resolve these these problems for many years. Since 1987, the Governor has tried three times to increase funding for highways. In 1987 and 1988, he introduced bills to address these needs and both times the bills failed to pass in the Legislature. Finally in 1989, after calling a special legislative session, he succeeded in getting 1/3 of the increase he had been seeking.
\
To stretch funding even more, the Governor organized an ""Efficiency Task Force"" charged with eliminating unnecessary costs within the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT). This effort was extremely successful as 100 jobs were cut and $5.4 million in savings were transferred to the construction budget. In addition, CDOT has been particularly successful in obtaining special funding from the Federal Government for such projects as Glenwood Canyon, C-470, and the reconstruction of the Mousetrap. This funding amounts to an additional $365 million that has come to Colorado since 1987. Had we not secured this extra funding, our road conditions would be even worse.
\
Our strategies are not limited to the ones I've just mentioned. Last year, the Transportation Commission established a policy doubling the amount of funding earmarked for resurfacing projects. Since July of last year, CDOT has spent over $127 million maintaining, resurfacing and reconstructing roads. This was the largest amount spent on these activities in the history of CDOT. This resurfacing policy will continue over the next five years. But our vision must be broader. We cannot continue to emphasize resurfacing as the only answer to deteriorating roads. CDOT has been working with local communities across Colorado to develop a Statewide Plan that embraces just such vision; one that also addresses mobility, capacity and safety needs.
\
Keeping Colorado's economy strong and healthy is a priority. A world-class transportation system is a vital strategy in that effort. But we must understand the investment we must make to create this system goes far beyond squeezing whatever efficiencies we can from CDOT.

140,"What a beautiful spring!\The ""it's spring, just kidding"" nature of Colorado's weather is one of the many things I like about living here.\In keeping with the theme of variability, this month's column is a potpourri of topics that have been on my mind. So, here you go.\Homelessness is the only issue that matters in Fort Collins, or so it seems as homeless advocates share their grievances at every regular session of the City Council. The real stories of need are almost drowned out by the accusatory and abusive tone of the aggrieved directed at city leaders.\In truth, the council and city staff deserve a lot of credit for trying to understand the situation and take reasonable actions.\One council member routinely defends the city's prohibition of camping in open lands. Councilman, let me assure you that business and property owners feel the same way about people trespassing on, urinating on, defecating on and trashing their properties.\While trying to protect the natural environment, don't forget to defend the environment we live and work in.\Even permissive San Francisco has its limits. A March poll by the San Francisco Chamber found that more than half of respondents believe the city is going in the wrong direction. The No. 1 issue fueling dissatisfaction: homelessness and attendant behavioral issues.\Remarkably, the issue even out-polled housing affordability.\To the leaders of Woodward, thank you for preserving the savable historic structures of the old Coy-Hoffman farm on your new corporate headquarters campus. That was your stated plan from the beginning, and you honored it to the best of your abilities after assessing the safety and soundness of the structures.\Progress is being made on a plan to widen the most congested portion of North Interstate 25. A plan is afoot to build a managed lane each direction in the next few years between Colorado Highway 14 in Fort Collins to just beyond Colorado 402 south of Loveland.\Doing so will cost about $235 million, if the money can be assembled.\Another opportunity to accelerate the widening of I-25 is the Fix Colorado Roads Act, which will be introduced soon in the Legislature. The bill would refer a measure to the fall ballot asking voters to approve up to $3.5 billion of bonding for transportation projects.\Repayment of the bonds would come from several sources including the state's general fund and gas tax revenues, among other options. Our own area legislators will need to get behind the bill for it to have a chance to pass.\Why the community needs to stay focused on economic development is evident with the announcement in mid-April that Intel will cut its worldwide workforce by 12,000 people. The local impact is expected to be modest, but it's a reminder that we are a workbench for Silicon Valley, and some decisions are beyond our control.\To offset that, we need to concentrate on supporting a climate that is conducive to primary employer retention, expansion and attraction.\There you have it. Enjoy a great, if variable, spring!\David May is president and CEO of the Fort Collins Area Chamber of Commerce. Reach him at davidmay@fcchamber.org.\Fort Collins Area Chamber of Commerce\David May"
141,"LindsayRenickMayer@coloradoan.com\In their first appearance together, Colorado's three gubernatorial candidates remained civil Friday while passionately addressing Referendum C, higher education and their visions for the future of the state.\Democrat Bill Ritter joined Republicans Bob Beauprez and Marc Holtzman in a forum at the Fort Collins Board of Realtors' 23rd Annual Government Affairs Luncheon. The three began with 10 minutes each to speak in general and then took on specific questions from the audience.\The most divisive topic seemed to be the passage of Referendum C.\""I think nothing frames what really will be the biggest issue in this campaign better than our debate in this state over the passage of Referendum C,"" said Ritter, former Denver district attorney. Ritter pointed to Referendum C dollars that the Legislature appointed to pre-kindergarten programs, tourism and higher education as evidence that the money is being put to good use.\Beauprez, one of Colorado's U.S. representatives, disagreed.\""The problem I have with C is it changed nothing,"" Beauprez said. ""All it did was keep more of your money and let the state spend it in the same old way without changing any of the circumstances that they say got us ... into the problem in the first place.""\Holtzman, former president of the University of Denver, blasted Referendum C and said as governor he'd return the excess revenue beyond the $3.1 billion Referendum C was originally meant to bring in.\""I believe Referendum C was a disaster for Colorado,"" Holtzman said. ""That money belongs to the people of Colorado, and I'm going to do everything in my power to return that money where it rightfully belongs.""\Economic issues will present the biggest challenges for the new governor, said Lew Wymisner, assistant director of the Larimer County Workforce, who attended the luncheon.\""The city of Fort Collins is hurting,"" Wymisner said. ""While the private sector is rebounding from the recession, government entities are still not out of the woods yet. It's still interesting times in terms of the economy.""\Ritter's campaign message is based on investing in the future by supporting people, infrastructure and institutions.\Holtzman hails Ronald Reagan Republican values and said the government must create an environment in which people can achieve and prosper, then quickly get out of their way.\Beauprez discussed four areas of infrastructure he said must be strengthened: transportation, water, education and health care.\""Government doesn't grow economy; people do that,"" Beauprez said. ""But government can provide the right kind of environment in which people who are willing to take the risk might be rewarded with a little bit higher livelihood and success.""\Beauprez argued that his ties to Washington make him a stronger candidate than his opponents.\All three emphasized the importance of funding higher education and developing partnerships between private and public entities for the sake of improved economic development.\""We sit in a town with a major research university,"" Ritter said of Fort Collins. ""If we as a state don't have a role in investing in that, we in the state will lose our cutting edge.""\The two Republicans also touched on immigration policy.\""As governor, I'm going to get tough on this issue,"" Holtzman said. ""This has nothing to do with compassion, but fairness and the rule of law.""\Transportation was also a hot topic.\Holtzman talked about increasing the number of lanes on Interstate 70 and Interstate 25, expanding the state's airports and building incentives for alternative energy sources. He said as governor he would present the voters with a detailed package of improvements, including a specific timetable for the projects to take place.\Transportation improvements need to be done in a way that align with the 21st century, Ritter said. This includes looking at commuter trains from Fort Collins to Pueblo and how transit can help highway commuters.\Beauprez called the gas tax out of date and said the state needs to seek a new funding source, which could come in part from creative private-public partnerships.\While some audience members might have made up their minds about the candidate they favor, Wymisner said he was still collecting information to make the best decision.\""It's nice to be exposed to more than a 30-second or one-minute sound bite,"" Wymisner said.\The Fort Collins Board of Realtors also awarded CSU president Larry Penley with their 2006 Citizen of the Year award at the luncheon.\""I'm very proud to be the president of CSU,"" Penley said. ""This, we believe, is a great economic engine of Northern Colorado, Colorado itself and this country."""
142,"Label: STATE\Growth far outpaces crime as the most important problem facing Colorado, according to a poll of 600 registered voters, including 400 along the Front Range.\The poll results, released Wednesday, showed nearly 36 percent of people interviewed ranked growth as the state's top issue. Crime was second at 21 percent. Education and transportation were far below.\The poll by the Norwest Public Policy Research Group at the University of Colorado in Denver focused mainly on transportation problems, most of which spring from the state's rapid growth.\Among its other findings:\Respondents ranked traffic congestion as the most difficult transportation problem facing themselves or their families.\More than 70 percent said maintaining existing roads was a ""high priority"" and nearly 68 percent of those said they'd be willing to pay higher taxes to keep maintenance up.\Just 18 percent said building new roads was a high priority; 34 percent said widening roads was a high priority.\About 75 percent said using sales taxes on auto parts for transportation projects was a good idea. No other money-making plans - including raising gas taxes or charging tolls - had more than a 56 percent approval rating.\The poll was paid for by the Denver-based Coalition for Mobility and Air Quality, an organization of engineers, planners and contractors pushing for more revenues for transportation improvements.\While the poll shows people are aware of transportation problems and the lack of money available to fix them, they disagree on which ones should be solved first.\But most people, the poll shows, agree on the way to solve the problems most important to them personally: raise taxes.\""We got a real strong sense that if you felt a problem was a priority, you're willing to consider more taxes to address it,"" said Peggy Cuciti, co-director of the polling group.\But taxes and fees would have to soar to cure everyone's pet peeve. State transportation officials say Colorado needs more than $31 billion to cover needs for the next 20 years but will get only about $11 billion in that time.\""Traditionally, throughout the history of the U.S., there's never been enough money to solve the transportation problems,"" said John Hanlon, a transportation planner with the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments. ""The money gets divided into too many small interest groups and too many different regulatory entities.""\State Sen. Ray Powers, R-Colorado Springs, said the poll affirms his belief that the best way to boost highway spending is to take money generated by existing taxes on auto parts and earmark it for transportation.\But Gov. Roy Romer has said he would veto such a proposal because it would take money from the general fund that he says is needed for education.\""I think what people are saying is they don't want to see taxes raised, they want to use existing dollars,"" Powers said. ""I think the governor has some kind of highway or gas tax in mind.""\POLL HIGHLIGHTS\In your opinion, what is the most important problem facing Colorado today?\Growth 35.6 percent\Crime 20.9 percent\Education 9.3 percent\Transportation 5.9 percent\Pollution 5.0 percent\Environment 2.7 percent\Water concerns 1.9 percent\If a transportation project is proposed to decrease congestion or accommodate growth, how much should its impact on air quality and the environment be considered?\A great deal 68.8 percent\Some 23.7 percent\A little 3.8 percent\None 3.6 percent\Do you believe that the condition and performance of the state's transportation system will decline if we continue to rely only on existing revenue sources?\Yes 62.5 percent\No 24.0 percent\Don't know 13.5 percent\What is the most difficult transportation problem for you and your family?\Congestion/traffic 31.0 percent\No problems 21.7 percent\Lack of mass transit 18.1 percent\Road conditions 11.0 percent\Other 4.7 percent"

We should focus federal government research and development efforts on promising technologies. Temporary gas tax relief is appropriate. Federal government policy drove up the\cost of gas. A short-term break\from the gas tax is a Band Aid, but an appropriate one. We should encourage the development of more nuclear reactors.\Economy: First, government\simply needs to get out of the way.\With years of experience dealing\with issues that are important to businesses large and small, I know that the United States owes its prosperity to our free market free\enterprise system. I believe that\government can't create wealth,\but it can certainly destroy it. Therefore, the only proper role for government in our economy is to foster an environment in\which American entrepreneurs\can use their creativity and their\willingness to take risks in order to create jobs, make new products, deliver wanted services, and, yes,\earn profits.\Second, we must cut deficit\spending and reduce our national debt.\Third, we must pursue free trade policies that reward our best trading partners but crack down on countries that treat free-trade like a one-way street.\Fourth, we must rein in reckless regulation, which creates cumbersome red-tape that hurts employers, particularly small business.

144,"DENVER - Rep. Joann Ginal, D-Fort Collins, asked lawmakers Thursday to fund a study on the health impacts of the onslaught of drilling and hydrolic fracturing close to front-range communities.\""Many Colorado families that live near oil and gas sites are concerned, they're very concerned,"" Ginal said. ""They want to be heard and I'm listening.""\Ginal said scientific data about potential health effects prompted five communities to vote to either ban or delay further oil and gas exploration in their jurisdictions.\""House Bill 1297 will finally bring some clarity to this debate about the safety of oil and gas extraction close to where people live,"" she said.\The House Health, Insurance and Environment Committee heard several hours of testimony about the bill from industry experts opposed to the bill and residents affected by nearby oil and gas exploration who urged further study. In the end, the committee delayed a vote until the next meeting.\The study would cost an estimated $200,000 a year for the next three years to implement.\Republicans on the committee said further study was unnecessary and that the bill was slanted against the industry.\""It seems to me that there is a broad, in-depth, unvaried opinion on this question already in the scientific literature, specifically when we look at peer-reviewed studies. A well-regulated industry does not pose public health threats to our citizens,"" said Rep. Frank McNulty, R-Highlands Ranch. ""Is this an instance where we have this body of science out there that indicates there is no threat ... trying to find a different outcome that fits the scenario that people might want it to fit?""\The debate Thursday over Ginal's bill is just one example of how the oil and gas industry has found itself front-and-center this political season.\The issue has been boiling since 2012 when voters in Longmont changed the city charter to prohibit fracking. The Colorado Attorney General and oil and gas companies subsequently sued the city saying regulation of natural resources is limited to state-level oversight.\In 2013, four other front-range jurisdictions followed Longmont, holding elections on the issue and either banning or putting a moratorium on fracking.\And while courts are poised to decide the issue, the public may get the chance first.\Two groups have introduced 16 ballot initiatives that deal mostly with granting local-governments control over the regulation of oil and gas development. Some introduced Thursday deal with set-back requirements from housing developments, schools and hospitals for oil and gas operators.\A well-organized opposition to those ballot initiatives is popping up, led by some of the state's largest oil and gas producers.\An issue committee was launched in January to oppose the ballot initiatives. The group, Protecting Colorado's Environment, Economy and Energy Independence, has already reserved $299,125 worth of TV ad time on KMGH Channel 7between September and November.\Rick Ridder, spokesman for the group that has filed all but one of the petitions to put local control on the November ballot, said he expects a long battle.\Ridder said they are in the process of winnowing their petitions down to the strongest. The Secretary of State's Office must first set a title and the language of the initiative and then, in theory, Ridder's group could begin collecting the roughly 97,000 signatures required to put the issue on the ballot.\But Ridder said he expects the language to be appealed to the Colorado Supreme Court.\""We're in the middle of a process that will last six to eight weeks,"" Ridder said. ""It all comes out of citizen's sentiments that they have a lack of ability to control what goes on with oil and gas drilling in their communities, in their neighborhoods, close to schools or close to hospitals. This is a citizen response to the activities the oil and gas drilling.""\Jon Haubert, director of communications for Coloradans for Responsible Energy Development, said his relatively young group is focused on educating the public about fracking issues. But the group did come out against ballot measures that could mean crippling local policies for the oil and gas industry, he said.\""It's just not possible or practical for hundreds of local governments to enact differing standards for the protection of natural resources, such as clean air and clean water, which are of statewide significance,"" Haubert said in a statement last month when the first of the local-control ballot titles was filed.\McNulty and Rep. Jerry Sonnenberg, R-Sterling, introduced a ballot initiative of their own on Thursday, one that would bar the five communities with fracking bans or moratoriums from receiving oil and gas tax dollars, specifically severance tax.\""If you adopt Sierra Club-type energy bans that hurt our communities and our schools, don't expect energy revenues to pick up your tab,"" McNulty said in an e-mail announcing the ballot initiative.\All of the ballot titles and early campaigning may be for naught, as there's still rumored to be a bill introduced late this legislative session that would deal with the local control issue.\In the meantime, Ginal's bill to study the health impacts of oil and gas has a long road ahead of it, through the House and the Senate and eventually to the governor's desk.\-\Contact Megan Schrader\719-286-0644\Twitter: @CapitolSchrader\Credit: BY MEGAN SCHRADER megan.schrader@gazette.com -"

Northwest Colorado's Piceance Basin - 5 million acres framed by cliffs and hogbacked mountains - overlies roughly 300 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, enough to supply the nation for 50 years. It's also ideal mule deer habitat; state wildlife managers once called it ""the deer factory."" But as drilling ramps up, deer numbers plummet.
\
Wildlife ecologist George Wittemyer of Colorado State University's Warner College of Natural Resources is halfway through a five-year study, working with other researchers to observe how deer behave and reproduce amid the vast network of roads and well pads. But neither the university nor the government is funding it. ExxonMobil is.
\
In 2010, the company gave the university $5 million to study energy development impacts on western Colorado's sage grouse, mule deer and other wildlife, spawning 20 new research contracts. Shell, BP and others have also recently poured millions of dollars into CSUs research. Warner College is even named for alum Ed Warner, who donated $30 million in 2005 after making a fortune pioneering hydraulic fracturing, or tracking, which has opened hard-to-reach oil and gas reserves worldwide.
\
It's good timing: As natural resource program enrollment grows, many universities face state-funding declines. It's not new for academia to consort with industries like agribusiness, mining and timber, especially at land-grant universities, initially established to provide affordable higher education in applied sciences and engineering. But given the nation's current oil and gas frenzy, the energy money is raising questions about academic integrity, and has left CSU and other schools navigating new ground - a task some are handling better than others.
\
""To be successful and to get social acceptance, (companies) know they have to protect the environment. They're coming to us to do (energy-related) studies on restoration, water, wildlife health and biodiversity, forest health,"" says Joyce Berry, Warner College dean. The university must maintain professional standards and boundaries. ""Our reputation depends on it.""
\
AT FIRST, WITTEMYER WAS SKEPTICAL, but so far he says industry money is like other sponsored research grants; it adheres to academic-integrity rules, and ExxonMobil does not control his research methods or findings. In a way, it makes sense for energy companies, rather than the public, to pay for studying industry's impacts and their mitigation. Wittemyer says it also helps him examine companies' real-world practices. Besides, he admits, his department couldn't afford the expensive tools and methodology otherwise.
\
Federal contributions to CSU have remained steady despite the recession, especially for natural sciences and climate change. Research funding at Warner College has risen 24 percent over the past five years (to $77 million in 2012), mostly from federal agencies like the National Science Foundation.
\
But applied science research - on environmental mitigation, for instance - receives less support. This past June, for example, a U.S. House committee rejected a White House request for $4.25 million to research drilling's water-quality impacts; critics say health and environmental studies aren't keeping up with development.
\
Meanwhile, declining state higher-ed funding (see chart next page) is forcing tuition hikes and hiring and salary freezes at many institutions. At CSU, state support has fallen nearly 30 percent over the past five years, while in-state tuition has skyrocketed 56 percent. At the same time, faculty and graduate teaching assistant staffing at Warner dropped 10 percent because there's no money to refill vacated posts.
\
""We need new funding models to provide an affordable education,"" says Hal Salwasser, former dean of Oregon State University's College of Forestry, another land-grant school. ""It's going to be coming from more private sources. I don't know of a school in the West that is not on that trajectory.""
\
State timber taxes funnel millions annually to Oregon State's forestry research, and some companies have endowed faculty chairs and made other private contributions. But that coziness can spark controversy. In 2006, an OSU graduate student coauthored a paper in Science refuting the idea that logging burned trees stimulates new forest growth. Timber officials and some professors unsuccessfully demanded that it be withdrawn, leading critics to decry the college's industry ties. The episode triggered discussions about research principles, but didn't lead to any formal changes - or reduce timber industry support or collaboration. ""They don't get to pick the professors or the students or the research design,"" Salwasser says.
\
IN 2010, the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, identified over 50 ""partnerships"" between universities and energy companies, with contributions ranging from $1 million to $500 million. Government investment in energy research and development is just a fraction of what it was in the 1970s, so such collaborations have helped foster ""critical advancements"" in technology. But, the report warned, ""Industry funding can have a powerful distorting influence on the quality, topics, and credibility of academic research when it is not properly managed.""
\
Recent controversies have underscored that point. The industry-supported Shale Resources and Society Institute at the State University of New York-Buffalo closed just a few months into its operation, after its first report concluded that Pennsylvania's tracking regulations effectively protected the environment and people - meaning that New York's proposed rules were safe - even though independent data showed accidents had increased under Pennsylvania's rules. Several report authors including Timothy Considine, now of University of Wyoming, also failed to disclose that they had worked for the gas industry. Similar issues have muddied tracking studies at University of Texas-Austin and Penn State, intensifying scrutiny of industry-funded research and earning it the moniker ""frackademia.""
\
The pace and scope of industry-academy alliances - which sometimes include delayed stock options for professors, or give corporate funders significant control over studies and results - have outstripped many schools' policies on financial conflicts of interest, disclosure of past work and intellectual property, says Cary Nelson, past president of the American Association of University Professors and co-author of a recent report recommending guidelines for such relationships. Some schools and professors now simply refuse energy money. ""The tracking industry has acquired some of the reputation of the tobacco industry,"" says Nelson, referring to cigarette companies that sponsored studies refuting the links between smoking and cancer.
\
The University of Wyoming's Haub School of Natural Resources, for example, has avoided industry research funds by attracting other private contributions to fund programs. Its Energy Mitigation Initiative, funded by non-industry backers, conducts similar studies to the ExxonMobil projects at CSU, although it only has a $200,000 budget. But the school still relies on state coal, oil and gas tax dollars, distributed through the Legislature, for part of its budget. Last May, academic freedom and industry influence clashed at Wyoming after lawmakers disapproved of a campus art installation that connected fossil fuels, forNeatdie-off and climate change. The circular ground display of fallen logs, called Carbon Sink, was promptly removed, along with other artwork. The Legislature then passed a law requiring the governor and university energy-resources advisers to approve future art displays at a new gymnasium.
\
CSU isn't rejecting industry, partly because departments, including Warner College, have collaborated with companies since the 1970s, says Dean Berry. But the investments and connections are growing. Last October, BP gave a CSU chemist $5 million to study ourecovery technology. Also in late 2011 and 2012, Houston-based Noble Energy, now working northeastern Colorado's Niobrara shale, and Halliburton contributed $250,000 and $53,400, respectively, toward the Colorado Energy Water Consortium through CSU's College of Engineering to study water issues related to drilling in the West.
\
Two years ago, Royal Dutch Shell endowed a chair for restoration ecology at Warner, giving $2 million to fund its research programs. Mark Paschke, who now occupies the chair and serves as the college's associate research dean, says Shell's generosity dates back to 2004, when it began supporting CSU's long-term studies of restoration practices at Piceance Basin well pads, after the U.S. Department of Energy stopped funding them.
\
CSU conflict-of-interest policies require researchers to disclose private consulting and other potential financial entanglements, says Paschke. Shell exercises no control over how he uses his research money, structures his studies, or releases his findings, he adds. But other schools that have faced criticism over disclosures and results, such as University of Texas, are overhauling conflict-of-interest and research-review rules.
\
To uphold academic standards at CSU, a review committee - including Warner College faculty, Colorado Parks and Wildlife staff, and a company representative - doles out ExxonMobil's funds and oversees research. It gives members 90 days to comment before an author publishes work - a month more than the federal government's standard review period, but not excessive, says Nelson. Nelson's organization recommends 56 such principles, which also address the use of confidentiality clauses in contracts, acceptance of gifts, and how to report conflicts of interest and protect the transparency of research and results. To ensure their effectiveness, schools must prevent companies from stacking review boards with members biased against particular topics or outcomes, or embargoing research and results they dislike.
\
If public funding continues to decline as schools tackle more complex environmental challenges, there may be no choice but to accept more industry money. ""We want to be the ones to help solve these really difficult issues,"" says CSU Warner College Dean Berry. So transparency and research review rules will have to continually adjust to prevent any undue influence.
\
College-namesake Warner, a Libertarian-leaning eccentric and self-proclaimed ""environmentalist who hates the environmental movement,"" says anti-industry prejudices are unfounded. ""Most research that academia and industry do together is arm's length and good science, and as long as it's subject to peer review, we can make sure it's not influenced by business ... or by 'feel good' science and environmentalists saying, *We love Bambi.' ""

Federico Peca served as mayor of Denver from 1983-91, U.S. secretary of transportation from 1993-97 and U.S. secretary of energy from 1997-98. He sat down with Daily Camera editorial page editor Dave Krieger on Dec. 1, 2014, in the Denver offices of Vestar Capital Partners, where he is a senior advisor, to discuss energy and transportation issues.
\
Here are edited excerpts of that conversation:
\
/>
\
Q:When you came to Boulder a little more than 18 months ago to give a speech about energy security, the price of oil was about $90 a barrel. A year and a half later it's down to $70. What's going on?
\
A: A lot of things are going on. Let me take you back even further. When I was secretary of energy in the 1990s, oil traded at $12. That was a crisis for Venezuela, for Mexico, for a lot of oil producers. American oil companies were also being hurt. We had to deal with shut-in wells in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico because small producers were going bankrupt and they were shutting in their wells.
\
So the conversation came up, ""What's a reasonable price for oil for most actors to be happy?"" And by most actors we meant the oil-producing nations, Texas producers, and so forth. And the thought back in the 1990s was somewhere between $23 and $25 a barrel would be a satisfactory price. So what happened? Mexico, which was not a member of OPEC, sent its energy minister to an OPEC meeting and said, ""We'll contribute Mexico's production to the pool of OPEC oil, but let's do something together and let's reduce supply."" Slowly, they started to cooperate and the price went up to $30, $35, and then it kept going. So the point is that so long as you have OPEC making decisions like that, it can manipulate the price of oil.
\
Let's fast-forward to today. Oil spiked to $140 a barrel a few years ago, and now it's down again, for a couple of reasons. One, because the economy in Europe is basically flat. The economy in Japan could be into recession. China's economy has slowed down. Our consumption was reduced here because we went through a recession also. So demand went down. Energy efficiency improved. All the new cars that are on the market in the U.S. are far more fuel efficient than they were back in the 1990s. So that has affected demand.
\
Supply has exploded, largely because of U.S. producers -- fracking, shale oil. So OPEC meets, and everybody is trying to figure out what OPEC is going to do. OPEC is not of one mind on this subject. Saudi Arabia, primarily, did not want to reduce its production and get the price of oil to go up because it wanted to keep market share. That's one theory. I have other theories about that. There are some rumors of geopolitical forces at work here. Saudi Arabia is not thrilled with Russia as an actor in the Middle East.
\
But the indirect byproduct is that American producers get hurt. At a certain price point -- $70, $65 a barrel -- there are certain parts of the country where even hydraulic fracturing is not profitable. So what happens if the price of oil continues to come down, as it did when I was secretary of energy and it hit $12 a barrel? American companies quit producing. And what happens when American companies quit producing? We start importing more oil and reducing our energy security. The one thing that Saudi Arabia and I think many of the Middle Eastern countries would love to do is to keep us on the hook, to ensure that we continue to need their oil.
\
Q: Let's talk about the environmental side. We have five communities along the front range that don't want fracking within their borders. Should there be limits on fracking?
\
A: Yes, absolutely, there should be limits. There are limits on everything we do in the United States. People can't just put up cable or telephone wires wherever they want. So, sure, there should be regulation and limits on where oil and gas companies can drill and how they pipe, where they refine and how they conduct their business. That's simply the nature of doing business in the United States these days.
\
I think the real question is can there be a reasonable balance so that the interests of local communities -- and by interests I mean environmental interests, safety interests, property value interests -- and the interests of the producers and drillers are balanced in a way that both win? I think there are ways to do that. This state already has a fairly comprehensive set of laws that have certain kinds of limitations on fracking and oil and gas drilling, probably some of the strongest in the nation. The commission the governor has put together I think makes a lot of sense. I'm hopeful they can come up with a reasonable compromise to balance both interests.
\
There are some who would say we shouldn't allow fracking altogether, we shouldn't allow any more drilling altogether, because it pollutes the air, it's a fossil fuel, we ought to get out of it. Well, that would be terrific if we could do it in about 40 or 50 years, if we plan for it, if it's done in a strategic and methodical fashion.
\
There's a natural progression if you look back in history to how the world has gone from one energy source to the next. So when people say, ""Well, we're always going to be using oil and gas,"" I ask, why? But if we do it in a very methodical way, so that you don't disrupt the economy, you don't disrupt the investments that people have made, that companies have made, there is a way for us to begin to invest in cleaner, alternative fuels over a period of years and then gradually phase out our over-dependence on fossil fuels. But we have to agree as a nation we want to do that as a matter of national policy. And we have not been able to do that. And we have to be able to agree from administration to administration that this will be a consistent policy of the United States.
\
If I were advising a big oil and gas company, I would say, ""Why don't you start investing more in alternative fuels? Don't be so reliant on oil and natural gas. Start looking at alternative fuels and think ahead 50 years, like the Chinese do, and say, 'In 50 years, do we want to be an oil and gas company or do we want to be an energy company that produces all kinds of energy?'"" Smart, forward-leaning companies do that kind of analysis. Those are the ones that survive and prosper.
\
""I believe we have a serious climate change crisis facing the world. I believe that ... it is largely man-made."" -- Federico Peca, on the environment
\
* * *
\
Q: Let's talk about the climate. There are many different versions of how bad it is now and how bad it's inevitably going to get before we transition away from fossil fuels. Do we have 40 years to stop burning fossil fuels?
\
A: I believe we have a serious climate change crisis facing the world. I believe that, while I'm not a scientist, not an engineer, I believe that it is largely man-made. While I understand that there are cyclical patterns of weather and formations in the world that go back centuries that might have some effect, I think I've got enough common sense to understand that this is largely man-made and driven by humanity.
\
I have confidence in the people of the planet to save themselves. One of the reasons the Japanese automakers are so supportive of hybrid vehicles and now the fuel cell technology that Toyota is rolling out in California, is they see what's happening to their island. For them, it's very real. It's very personal. So they're very much into energy efficiency in reducing toxic emissions, greenhouse gases. Others are beginning to recognize it also. I was just in China a month and a half ago. There were places in Beijing and Shanghai and even into the interior of China where I had trouble breathing. The Chinese know that. You see the pictures of people wearing masks in downtown Beijing and they tell people to quit driving and quit burning stuff when they're having international meetings there. They know that it's a health problem for their nation. So they finally have agreed to start taking steps. People have criticized what they have done, but at least they're doing something. I think India's going to figure it out, too.
\
So I believe we have to do something. And I think we still have to pursue what the United Nations is trying to pursue and what the president is trying to pursue, and others, and that is to come up with agreements among the nations of the world, to lay out a plan, and there are plans already out there, that could get us there. And no, I don't agree that it's too late. I think there are always things we can do to save the planet and to reduce these emissions.
\
I remember when I was mayor of Denver, we violated the carbon monoxide standard, I think, 41 days out of the year. When I left office, we got it down to one day. Now, we had to do bans on wood-burning fireplaces and also stoves, too, I think. We had the alternate days of driving with your license plate. We had ride shares. We had telecommuting that we encouraged. We started paving alleys because that was contributing particulates into the air, causing the haze and the brown cloud. We did a lot of things. We started using oxygenated fuels during the winter season. So we had to do a lot of things and some people weren't happy, but we got it down to one day. Now we're having to deal with ozone and some other issues.
\
My point is there are always people who will say it's too late or we can't do something because it's an insurmountable problem, and I've seen this nation time and time and time again, accomplish great things when we set our minds to it, when the community says enough's enough.
\
I think as a nation and as a planet, we're going to figure this out. And it may take a crisis, it may take some real soil erosion, it may take some coasts being wiped out around the world. It might take some parts of our country. We've got islands off the Florida coast that are worried about this kind of thing. But at some point I think most people will finally come to their senses and begin to take action. Now, the longer we wait, the more dramatic the action's going to be. No question about that.
\
* * *
\
Q: Let's go back to the local control issue. Should a home-rule city like Longmont or Lafayette or Boulder or Fort Collins be able to say ""No, we don't want drilling within our borders""?
\
A:Well, I am not an expert on constitutional law as it pertains to home-rule cities. I'm hopeful this governor's commission will come up with the right kind of balance which protects not just home-rule cities but any city, any municipality that may not have home-rule status.
\
But there are also some other factors at work here. The companies that are doing the drilling, sometimes people may perceive them as being these mechanistic, androidal entities that don't care about what they're doing. There's something called reputational risk that most American companies worry a lot about. Because they know that reputational risk can damage, if you're a publicly traded company, your stock price, and frankly, things happen to companies that don't care about their reputation. So I think that if you come up with some reasonable rules and a reasonable balance, I think most of the parties will find a way to reach a consensus where most people will be satisfied.
\
Will everybody be satisfied? No. There are some people who will never want another oil and gas rig drilling anywhere in America. You could put it in the middle of the desert and they are simply opposed to that for very strict environmental reasons. There are other people who are on the other side, who will say if Exxon Mobil wants to drill in downtown Denver, they should be able to do it. Those aren't what I consider to be the reasonable majority of people in the middle. I think the majority of people in the middle are going to find there's a way to reach a compromise here.
\
Some mistakes have been made along the way. I think one of the mistakes made by some members of the oil and gas industry was a reluctance to share the ingredients and the materials they were injecting into the ground on the basis that somehow that was a trade secret. That was a mistake. There are a lot of corporations that share very important financial information and other information with the federal government, with state governments, in many other sectors . . . . From the beginning, when a number of companies were reluctant even to do that, I think that cast a cloud of suspicion on them and they could have avoided that.
\
Q: Boulder is pretty far down the road now in pursuing municipalization of its electric utility. You've been a mayor and you've been secretary of energy. Give me the pros and cons of that.
\
A: I've followed it from a distance, so I can't say I've followed all the intricacies of what Boulder has done. I would simply say this: Any community that wants to move in that direction first has to ask itself, what is its goal? What are you trying to accomplish? In most cases, when municipalities do this, their concern is that the price of electricity is too high and their customers and their constituents are being taken advantage of. And also, for companies in that city that are in an uncompetitive position compared to a competitor in a surrounding county that has lower electricity prices.
\
So if the purpose is to rein in prices because prices are escalating too quickly, that's a very legitimate reason to do something. Generally speaking, the fact is that Colorado electricity rates are not out of line with the nation as a whole.
\
If the reason is to have more, as a matter of public policy of the people of Boulder or any community, that it wants to move more quickly towards renewables, that's a different kind of reason, but it's also a legitimate reason. If it is to have more control over its destiny, and not be exposed to the forces of a multi-state corporation, that might be another reason. So different communities might have different reasons, but I think the community first has to agree on what its priority is. What problem is it trying to fix? Is there a problem? And if there is, then you set about trying to figure out how to do it.
\
Once you've decided that you have a legitimate, well-understood and universally-accepted purpose for doing this, the next question is can you do it in a way that is financially responsible. The last thing you want to do if you take over a system is to end up with rates that are higher for your constituents than they were under the base-case scenario. You'll have some very unhappy voters and secondly you'll have companies that will start leaving. So, if you're going to go down that path, the people who are planning this have to have a fairly high degree of confidence that they're going to end up with competitive rates, or maybe even lower rates.
\
And thirdly, if the goal is to have more renewable or alternative energy, then there's a way to do that, but again you've got to assure yourself that you can do it in a way that doesn't cause rates to go up for the taxpayer. Because unless you can answer all those questions with some reasonable assurance, and you can never have absolute certainty, then I think there are risks to doing it. On the other hand, if you can answer those questions with reasonable certainty, then I think it's a very plausible and reasonable thing for a community to do.
\

\
Q: One point opponents raise is the question of competence. Is a city government going to run an electric utility with the same competence as a company that is devoted entirely to that purpose and has decades of experience at it?
\
A: It is a legitimate question. Now, there are examples of cities that have been running their power companies for years very competently. It's a unique skill set. You've got to have people who are very knowledgeable about a lot of very complicated issues. Are you going to build your own power plants? Are you going to build your own solar or wind installations or are you going to buy power from other places, and if so, how are you going to do that? Are you going to invest in a renewable energy plant in the middle of the Mojave Desert and then have that electricity imported into the city? These are all highly, highly technical questions that are not for novices. That's point No. 1.
\
Point No. 2 is the financial side of this. Running this kind of a utility is very complicated from a capital investment perspective, from a maintenance perspective and then from a perspective of setting reasonable rates so you can bring in enough revenue to make sure your operation is run profitably. The good news is you don't need a margin of return that a utility needs. But you still need a profit because you're going to have to have reserves to maintain the infrastructure that you now own. So a lot of very complicated issues. But a lot of cities have done this and they've done it very well. The last thing you want to do, however, is end up in a situation where any community that does this all of a sudden ends up with higher rates compared to neighbors, and then people are going to start leaving the city, or start to complain.
\
The other point I want to make is that if you look at other areas, like water, the Denver Water Department is a highly sophisticated enterprise, probably one of the best water systems in America, I would say run far better than a lot of private water companies that I'm aware of. So it is not necessarily true that a governmental entity cannot run a utility of some kind, and we've seen examples both in water and electricity where municipalities have done it and done a very good job and served their customers quite well.
\
Q: Let's talk about transportation. Everybody in this metropolitan area sees the vast number of wasted manhours and womanhours in the traffic jams that we have -- central Denver, the Boulder Turnpike. CDOT recently announced the Boulder Turnpike will be privatized over the next 50 years. What's wrong and how do we fix it?
\
A: No. 1, we have to embrace technology more aggressively than we have in the past. One of the reasons there is so much traffic congestion in metropolitan communities is because of accidents, almost more so than volume. Where there is an accident, it's so difficult to go and take the vehicles out of the middle of I-25 or I-70 or the Boulder Turnpike, wherever you are, that you have backups for hours in some cases. There's two or three ways you can deal with that. One is you set up special command centers, and some cities have done this, where as soon as an accident happens, the command center knows about it and is able to get in through other access points to relieve the accident and let the flow of traffic resume. Another solution that I think is coming, and I talked about in the 1990s when I was secretary of transportation, is collision-avoidance vehicles.
\
In the air, we have TCAS systems (traffic collision avoidance system), so that airplanes don't crash, and we've forced the airlines to spend money in installing this collision-avoidance equipment, and it works. We can have the same with automobiles.
\
That's on the highway side and the vehicle side. But that's not enough. You have to give people options. So those options are everything from light rail, a better bus system, more biking, trails. We've got to develop communities where people can walk to work. A lot of young professionals in this metropolitan area don't have cars. They rent these cars, these eco cars, when they need them and they walk to work. This generation is very different. So we've got to do a better job of planning so people don't have to use their vehicles as much.
\
The other issue is the role of the private sector. One of the reasons that we're privatizing light rail and privatizing highways is the federal government hasn't lived up to its responsibility to pass a new highway bill. When I was secretary of transportation, we passed a six-year highway bill with 300-something billion dollars with bipartisan support. So all the governors and all the states and the cities would know how much money they were going to get from the federal government and then they could increase the state gas tax or invest as we did in a new airport, but at least there was a sense of security and a sense of knowledge about what the federal government was going to do.
\
This Congress can't even pass a highway bill. The last highway bill was for eight months. I think it expires in March or April of next year. So how can you plan? What's happening is, cities, counties and states are privatizing because they can't count on federal dollars. The Congress has been unwilling to increase the federal gas tax since 1996. You could have added a CPI index to the tax so that it gradually goes up with inflation, so you don't have to come back year after year after year. That way it keeps up with the needs of the country, the needs of the state.
\
For some reason we have a group of people in Washington who seem to have lost a vision of the nation and having a national priority for the American people. So that's why we flounder in all these things and people are left to their own devices.
\
""For some reason we have a group of people in Washington who seem to have lost a vision of the nation and having a national priority for the American people."" -- Federico Peca, on government dysfunction
\
* * *
\
Q: You've mentioned that dysfunction on a number of these issues. Do you have any view on how that gets solved? It's certainly been this way now for a while. When you were in Washington, the partisanship was pretty fierce and it has not abated since then. Do you see a solution?
\
A: The difference was we got things done. We got a highway bill passed. We reformed welfare. We eliminated the federal deficit. We reduced the federal debt. When George Bush became president in 2000, he had a budget surplus. The debt was being reduced. So Washington can function with the right kind of people who are willing to sit down and compromise and have a national vision. We seem to have lost that in Washington today. What has to happen now? The American people have to stand up and start demanding more from their elected officials. The American people, the people of Colorado, need to get all their members of Congress in one room and tell them to start cooperating or we're not going to support them anymore in any election; we're not going to finance their campaigns.
\
Q: Is that realistic given the balkanization of districts? So many districts are safe now.
\
A: I had a conversation with a group of business people about five years ago. There was a retreat somewhere and they asked me to go speak. And we talked about this, dysfunction in the Congress. I said, ""Why don't you get all the Colorado delegation and put them in one room and tell them unless they start cooperating, we're not going to give you a penny more for your elections?"" One person asked the question, ""Can we do that?"" I said, ""It's your money.""
\
There are a lot of reasonable CEOs and business people in the state and in the country who want our country to succeed and they would like Washington to function and they would like the extremists to go away. Now there are some who don't care, but there are many who do. I think you get the people who have a shared vision about what your country wants to be and you get them to agree.
\
The same is true of voters. It's not just about money. It's about voting. That means we as voters have to demand more of our elected officials. That means we as voters have to be more knowledgeable about how our elected officials behave in Washington compared to when they're back home, telling us one thing here and doing something else in Washington. We've got to hold people accountable. So it's really up to us. Democracy, as people have said, is not a spectator sport. In presidential elections, we have only 60 percent of the American people voting. That means 40 percent are not. You go to Iraq and there's 90 percent turnout.
\
So we know how to fix this. We've got to participate. We've got to get control of the politics of the nation. We have to get engaged again. We have to care again and do something about it. We have to make the sacrifice of being more knowledgeable about what's going on in Washington and what our elected officials are doing or not doing and we have to express our point of view and we have to demand that people start doing what is best for the state or best for the country. It's really up to us.
"
147,"Label: COLORADO LEGISLATORS\DENVER - A combination of skill, seniority and connections have landed El Paso County's lawmakers key leadership roles in the 1997 Colorado General Assembly - positions that almost guarantee they'll have a significant influence on the major issues of this year's session.\For the past five years, the Republican-controlled Legislature has tapped local lawmakers for two of its four top positions.\Jeff Wells, now in his fourth term in the Senate, was first elected majority leader in 1986, while Chuck Berry has served as House speaker since 1991. In addition, a number of El Paso County legislators also are in charge of various committees.\The Gazette takes a look at what to expect from the county's eight representatives and four senators.\Here's a look at what to expect from El Paso County's representatives and senators:\THE HOUSEOF REPRESENTATIVES\CHUCK BERRY\Position: Speaker of the House\Pet issue: Putting counties in charge of welfare programs\Quote: ""We don't want to replace a huge federal bureaucracy with a huge state bureaucracy.""\As House speaker, Berry has kept a low profile, preferring to lead from behind the scenes and delegate responsibility to other members.\For the 46-year-old attorney, this session will mark a dramatic departure from that style. This is Berry's last term in the House and, he says, his last chance to champion causes close to his heart. But it's also no secret Berry is looking at a bid for governor in 1998 - and perhaps issues that can score him points in a statewide campaign.\He's taken on what many believe is the year's major issue - welfare reform. Berry is sponsoring one of the two major Republican bills on the issue.\He'll reintroduce a bill, vetoed last year by Democratic Gov. Roy Romer, that would prohibit localities from raising the minimum wage. He'll also work on a bill that would place additional limits on workers compensation benefits.\DOUG DEAN\Position: Vice chairman of the House Education Committee\Pet issue: Chemical castration for sex offenders\Quote: ""It's the most humane thing to do not only for society and the children but also for the prisoner because they can actually lead a normal life.""\This second-term representative will champion a bill that would require child molesters who are repeat offenders to be castrated through chemical injection as a condition of parole.\Dean, 36, who has a small painting contracting business, also will sponsor legislation to encourage private and nonprofit groups to set up foster care homes. And, at the urging of El Paso County Sheriff John Anderson, Dean will sponsor legislation that would give sheriffs financial rewards for stopping prisoners who are illegally collecting welfare and unemployment benefits.\MARY ELLEN EPPS\Positions: Chairwoman of Health, Environment, Welfare and Institutions Committee; member of the Finance Committee\Pet Issues: Long lines for driver's licenses, unsolicited magazine subscriptions\Quote: ""I've gotten subscriptions for everything from Parenting to Ebony to Time - and I didn't order any of them!""\The bill that could win her the Most Popular Legislator title is neither complex nor erudite as issues go: It would allow people to renew their driver's licenses by mail and would apply to people with no traffic violations during the previous five years.\The 62-year-old veteran lawmaker also plans to take on the magazine industry again for pursuing payment for unsolicited subscriptions. Her measure would impose fines on companies that mail subscriptions to those who didn't order them.\DOUG LAMBORN\Positions: Member of the Legislative Council, Judiciary and Appropriations committees\Pet issues: Parental rights, tax credits, late-term abortions\Quote: ""I just don't think it's appropriate, in an overzealous attempt to find children who have problems in the eyes of social workers, for them to be asked about their parents' possible substance abuse problems or firearms' possession or religious beliefs.""\A conservative both fiscally and socially, this 42-year-old attorney will sponsor legislation this year that would increase tax exemptions for pensions and offer tuition tax credits to those who send their children to public or private colleges and universities in the state.\Lamborn also wants appellate-level judges in the state to undergo Senate confirmation. He thinks public schools should get permission from parents before they perform any psychological testing on children. He will reintroduce a bill, which was killed last year, that would restrict late-term abortions.\RON MAY\Positions: Chairman of the Transportation Committee, member of the Business Affairs and Labor Committee\Pet issues: Highway funding, information management\Quote: ""The schools think they ought to get every penny that comes in. I'll be fighting for all the highway funding dollars we can get for capital construction.""\During his four years in the House, this 62-year-old computer consultant has focused most of his energy on a handful of issues - most notably the condition of roads and the state government's antiquated information management systems.\This year, May will co-sponsor a bill to divert more proceeds from the state's tax on vehicles into road repair and construction. But perhaps his most ambitious idea is for a new quasi-private central agency to serve as a clearinghouse for information from 23 state agencies. Information collected by the proposed Colorado Information Network Authority would be available within minutes on the Internet.\ANDY McELHANY\Positions: Member of the Business Affairs and Labor, Transportation and Capital Development committees\Pet issues: Tax credits, deadbeat parents.\Quote: ""Most people are shocked to find that the age of consent in this state is 15 years old.""\Last year, the 56-year-old real estate broker sponsored the law that revokes the driver's licenses of parents who refuse to pay child support.\This year, he plans to take on this issue of statutory rape. He wants to raise the age of consent from 15 to 18, a proposal that should have little trouble passing.\McElhany also wants tax credits for businesses that donate technical equipment to schools and libraries. And he's working on a bill that would encourage retired doctors to volunteer at health clinics in exchange for a guarantee that they would be exempt from liability.\MARCY MORRISON\Positions: Vice chairwoman of the House Committee on Health, Environment, Welfare and Institutions\Pet issues: Consumer protection in health care, social services reform\Quote: ""The (managed health care) industry is growing up, and as it matures it needs to polish off the rough edges. Every day there seems to be a headline with a new merger or company. We have to make sure consumers are well served.""\This 61-year-old community activist, who got her start in politics on the El Paso County commission and school board in Manitou Springs, will begin her third term as a legislator.\This year, she will continue to focus mostly on improving access to health care and reforming the social services system. She proposes to set up consumer protection standards for the managed health care industry. Another Morrison measure would assist people with intractable pain, making it easier for them to obtain prescriptions, for example.\Morrison also will push for renewed funding of a handful of centers that help parents find services such as child care and employment information.\BILL SINCLAIR\Positions: Member of the Education and Finance committees\Pet issues: Condition of roads, state regulations\Quote: ""I told my constituents if they were going to measure my efficiency by the amount of legislation I pass they have the wrong instrument. I think there is too much legislation right now.""\The newest member of the El Paso County delegation is a retired Air Force officer who has built a consulting business helping churches manage their finances.\Sinclair, elected to replace retiring Rep. Bill Martin, R-Colorado Springs, doesn't expect to propose a lot of new legislation in his first year. Most of his time will be spent learning the system, studying issues such as welfare reform and tapping into his politically active constituency in central Colorado Springs.\THE SENATE\CHARLES DUKE\Positions: Vice chairman of the Senate Committee on State, Veterans and Military Affairs, member of the Education and Transportation committees\Pet issues: States' rights, the U.S. Constitution\Quote: ""We have enemies of our Constitution even in the Colorado Legislature. I want to make sure we expose them so the people know who they are.""\A staunch defender of states' rights, the U.S. Constitution and far-right populist causes, Duke has rarely had a quiet session in his eight years at the Capitol. But so far, his proposals are surprisingly low-key.\Concerned that students are woefully ignorant of the foundations of American democracy, Duke will sponsor legislation requiring public schools to teach students about the U.S. Constitution as well as important historical documents - such as the Declaration of Independence and the Federalist Papers.\Another bill would require companies that do state highway projects, such as overlays and repairs, to give the state a warranty on their work.\RAY POWERS\Positions: Vice chairman of the Transportation Committee; member of the State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee\Pet issues: Highway funding, criminal sanctions on gangs\Quote: ""The objective is to choke the life from gangs that choke society. Current laws allow these thugs back on the street. I want them in jail.""\Powers, just elected to his fifth term in the Senate, plans to reintroduce a bill, vetoed last year by Romer, that would take part of the money raised from a state tax on vehicles and spend it on highway construction. It would mean about $150 million extra for roads - money that is currently going to the general fund. In case the governor vetoes the bill again, Powers has another proposal in the wings to refer the measure to voters.\Responding to past abuses of the El Paso County pension fund, Powers wants to prohibit public retirement funds from investing more than 10 percent of their funds in real estate. At the same time, it would allow them to invest up to 65 percent of a fund in common or preferred stocks rather than today's limit of 50 percent.\At the request of Colorado Springs Police Chief Lorne Kramer, Powers will carry a proposal making it a felony for a person to participate in a gang if he or she has knowledge that the gang is involved in criminal activity. It also seeks to punish those who supply firearms to gang members.\MARYANNE TEBEDO\Position: Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on State, Veterans and Military Affairs\Pet issues: Highway funding, giving more power to local government\Quote: ""This is going to be a session that requires a lot of homework. It's also going to require us to dust off our principles and ideologies and see if we want local government to be the driver of our welfare system or . . . state bureaucracy.""\Tebedo, who begins her third term in the Senate, is best known for her push to make it easier for people to carry concealed weapons.\But her primary concern this session is repairing the highways. She'll propose two constitutional amendments involving the roads. The first would require that money from gas taxes go solely to highway maintenance and construction. Right now, some goes to pay for tax collection and the Colorado State Patrol. The second proposal would allow the state to spend all gas-tax revenues on highway construction and maintenance rather than having the money build in reserves under Amendment 1, Colorado's spending-limitation law.\Tebedo also wants more standards for opticians and more money for counties affected by gambling. And in an effort to control the cost of automobile insurance premiums, she's proposing a cap on the medical fees paid by auto insurers.\JEFF WELLS\Position: Senate majority leader\Pet issues: School finance, child support\As Senate majority leader, it's Wells' job to keep the Senate running on schedule and help make sure Republicans have their votes in line on important issues.\But during the years he has also developed two specialties: school finance and child support. As he has in the past, he'll either carry or co-sponsor the major school funding bill of the year. He'll also sponsor a bill that makes mostly technical changes to child-support laws.\He'll also embroil himself in the controversy surrounding the Colorado High School Activities Association's decision to keep a 19-year-old Greeley student with Down syndrome from playing high school football because of his age. Wells wants to give local school boards more leeway to make exceptions."
148,"America's Mountain may become a mountain of expense for Colorado Springs.\Pikes Peak represents 14,110 feet of adventure, recreation and gold-era prosperity. It's a Paul Bunyan-sized magnet that draws 500,000 tourists a year and millions of dollars for local hotels, restaurants, gas stations and attractions.\It also represents a potential multimillion-dollar liability for the city if a Sierra Club lawsuit is successful.\Environmentalists argue the peak's alpine wetlands and streams are being choked to death by gravel. The culprit: the 13 miles of the Pikes Peak Highway that remain unpaved.\It's generally believed the road has stayed unpaved to preserve an 82-year-old annual auto race to the top.\The lawsuit against the city and the U.S. Forest Service, alleging a violation of the Clean Water Act, has trained a spotlight on the struggle between efforts to preserve a natural resource and desires to preserve local tradition - namely the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, which runs each July 4 on the gravel road.\Environmental problems - erosion from gravel runoff - have continued, despite recommendations over the years that the highway be paved:\In 1952, the U.S. Forest Service called for paving and other erosion work.\In 1992, the city's master plan also called for paving, citing its potential to reduce erosion and save money on maintenance.\In 1997, a consultant hired by the city blamed erosion for damage to wetlands and recommended a series of upgrades, including paving.\For decades, the city said it had no money for the work.\And as those decades progressed, the cost to fix the problem has grown from an estimated $345,000 in 1952 to $14 million today.\Some city officials acknowledge the ""political ramifications"" of ending the hill climb have stalled paving in the past, along with a shortage of funds.\The hill climb, second to the Indianapolis 500 as the nation's oldest continuously run auto race, pays little to use the road for a week each summer but brings international fame to the region.\Direct political influence is hard to pin down, but there's no question the race enjoys a legacy difficult to ignore. It was started by one of the city's most illustrious forebears, Spencer Penrose, builder of The Broadmoor hotel and creator of the El Pomar Foundation.\Whatever the outcome of the lawsuit, the stakes are enormous.\If the city prevails, the mountain will continue to suffer, environmentalists say.\""We think it's unacceptable that the city is basically trashing this national monument,"" said Mike Freeman, an attorney with Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund in Denver, which represents the Sierra Club.\""It's a symbol of the West,"" Freeman said, ""a national treasure where hundreds of thousands of people come every year.""\If the city loses, it could be ordered to do what's necessary to stop the erosion, including paving and other drainage projects, and also to pay the Sierra Club's attorney fees.\Springs Mayor Mary Lou Makepeace contends the city's goal, like the Sierra Club's, is to preserve the mountain and the road ""probably does need paving.""\But, she added, ""The citizens of Colorado Springs shouldn't be the ones to bear the cost. It is a national attraction.""\Makepeace said a shortage of money is the reason the road hasn't been paved.\Colorado Springs, which leases the highway from the U.S. Forest Service, denies environmental violations have occurred from the 1.5 million tons of gravel that have been put on the road since 1970.\The Forest Service, in court documents, admits ""highway maintenance practices"" have contributed to the erosion of gravel from the highway. The agency, however, contends the lawsuit should be dismissed because the city is pursuing a course that will bring the highway into compliance with federal law.\The legal battle over the problem is now in the evidence-gathering phase.\Gravel creates problems\In the last decade alone, more than 15,000 truck loads of gravel have been dumped on the road to maintain it. Rain, grading and normal use have subsequently pushed the gravel down the mountain.\The consequences: The Forest Service reported in 1993 that sediment from erosion had exceeded acceptable levels by 345,000 percent in one mountain stream. Biological productivity of some others has plunged by 85 percent.\The first 6 miles of the 19-mile highway are paved, and Forest Service researchers calculated sediment buildup from the gravel area is 78,000 percent greater than that of the paved section.\""These should be pristine high mountain streams, but instead they're channels of gravel,"" said Sierra Club member Jim Lockhart.\For example, in one spot within 100 yards of the Halfway Picnic Area about 10 miles up the highway, erosion has carved a ridge near the road into a 19-foot-deep chasm.\Past studies assert erosion is significant.\When the Forest Service issued the city its 30-year permit in 1990, it demanded the city comply with all federal environmental laws and compile a master plan for erosion control no later than Dec. 31, 1991.\In a March 13, 1991, letter, the Forest Service reminded the city that ""other uses such as racing events are secondary to our mission.""\Despite that, hill climb representatives were invited to join city and Forest Service officials in compiling the plan.\Completed in September 1992, the report's conclusion was nothing new. It recommended paving the highway and drainage-control projects.\Moreover, the committee found that besides reducing effects on the environment, paving poses ""significant annual savings for maintenance.""\Mount Evans, the state's only other fourteener to have a road to its summit, is paved, and the difference is like night and day, said Sierra Club member Lockhart.\He and others cite both the environmental and monetary benefits.\""Mount Evans has none of the environmental problems that Pikes Peak has,"" he said, attributing the difference to paving.\""Unequivocally, the paved surface on Mount Evans is environmentally sound,"" agreed Sierra Club member Gail Snyder, a member of the Pikes Peak Highway Advisory Commission, a citizen board that advised staff on how the highway is run.\The commission was suspended after the lawsuit was filed because the city didn't want the club, via Snyder, to be privy to discussions about its legal strategy.\""You're not having to constantly put gravel down to maintain the road as a driving surface,"" Snyder said.\Unlike Pikes Peak, the Mount Evans highway is closed during winter months, so its budget and operation are impossible to compare with that of Pikes Peak, city officials say.\By the city's own estimates, paving Pikes Peak would save money.\A 1991 staff study concluded paving would have saved $2.5 million from 1992 to 1998.\Today, however, the city estimates only a slight or no cost advantage to paving, saying one maintenance cost would be traded for another.\""Hauling gravel is an issue, but so is filling potholes,"" said Hans Schalk, the city's highway manager. ""If we could do erosion control so that sediment doesn't get off the road, it wouldn't need paving.""\Schalk recently estimated maintenance of the dirt road at $450,000 a year vs. paving at $275,000 a year, noting the latter does not take into account periodic overlay, which can cost up to $1.5 million or more.\""If that's added, the cost is virtually the same,"" he said.\To date, not a foot of pavement has been laid, even though an exhaustive $400,000 study by Drexel Barrell & Co., a Boulder consulting firm hired by the city, also recommended paving.\Why has the city dragged its feet?\""Because the city has been in the hill climb's back pocket for 50 years,"" said John Hazlehurst, a former councilman who argued unsuccessfully to pave the highway before leaving office in 1997.\Hill climb officials deny getting special treatment and point to the master plan's recommendation as evidence.\But there's no question the hill climb has a sweet deal.\Penrose improved road\Penrose, an Easterner who made a fortune milling Cripple Creek gold and Utah copper, seemed to own Pikes Peak. And maybe he did.\Even before building The Broadmoor, Penrose spent $250,000 to construct a road to the peak's summit in 1915.\The goal: to attract tourists to supplant the declining gold-mining industry.\It worked. Tourism picked up, and in 1916 Penrose started the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.\Penrose tired of the highway, however, and turned it over to the state in the mid-1930s. When the state couldn't afford to maintain it, the city assumed control in 1948 and soon signed its initial agreement with the Forest Service.\In 1937, Penrose established the El Pomar Foundation - a charitable trust containing almost his entire fortune.\Since Penrose's death in 1939, El Pomar has grown into the Rocky Mountain region's largest foundation. It has assets of more than $420 million and has made grants exceeding $223 million in education, health care, human services, the arts and the environment.\Until about a decade ago, El Pomar and the hill climb had board members in common.\""Through the years, there's been a close association with El Pomar"" by the hill climb, said El Pomar's chairman and chief executive officer, William Hybl.\""The El Pomar Foundation has had an interest in the hill climb and thinks it's a good event for the community.""\In 1996, El Pomar donated $25,000 to the race's museum.\But the foundation - like the hill climb - has given nothing to help fix the highway.\City officials said El Pomar, in response to an oral inquiry, said it's not in the business of funding construction projects.\Still, Hybl said the board will consider any application from the city.\Hill climb organizers oppose paving the highway for economic and safety reasons.\Paving would change the character of the race and perhaps kill it, supporters say.\The race carries a $1.6 million payroll - the equivalent of 103 full-time jobs. It raises $158,000 annually in city, county and state sales tax generated by the race, according to a 1996 study by David Bamberger & Associates. The event also generates an estimated $4.8 million a year in local sales.\Jim Bensberg, chairman of the hill climb's public relations committee, said the race is ""part of the Pikes Peak lore"" that draws attention to the region.\He also noted the race is sponsored by heavy-hitters like Chevrolet and Pennzoil. Because of the race, he said, the peak is a testing ground for auto technology, which further promotes the region.\Pennzoil's interest in the race is so intense it proposed a new product, called PennzSuppress, to reduce dust on the peak. The hill climb hopes it will negate the need for asphalt. It's now being tested on sections of the road, but consultants Drexel Barrell & Co. concluded PennzSuppress achieved ""no significant improvement"" of the road's stabilization.\Hill climb spokesman Buster Cogswell worries paving will have financial ramifications for the highway operation.\""If pavement causes tourists to speed up, and we have accidents and problems because of unsuspecting black ice, then there will be pressure to close the road during the winter,"" he said.\Cogswell contends that if the road is closed some months, revenue would drop. Lost revenues from wintertime might close the road year-round, he said.\But there's not much revenue to lose during January, February and March, records show.\From 1990 through 1995, those three winter months accounted for 5 percent of all days the road was open for travel. In some years, the road has shown losses of up to $50,000 in January alone.\A study done by two highway commission members in 1996 concluded the only months the highway showed a profit were July through September. Losses from January through June and October through December 1995 totaled nearly $700,000, the report said.\Hill climb backers acknowledge erosion exists but say adding small dams and holding ponds would reduce the problem.\""Pavement doesn't slow the velocity of water,"" Cogswell said. ""If anything it speeds it up.""\He said the race has been wrongfully accused of undue influence over the paving decision.\""We don't really know what's in the minds of people making those decisions,"" said Cogswell, a former city councilman. ""I can tell you there's very little contact between us and the city fathers making these decisions.""\But there's no question the hill climb benefits while paying little for the road's use.\Its only direct cost is $1,000 per day for tire tests - about $15,000 per year, city officials said.\The other charge - $30,000 to cover the cost of tolls lost while the road is closed to visitors during the race - is paid with the lodgers and auto rental tax (LART).\So far, the council hasn't formally considered the idea of charging the hill climb, although staffers and a citizen advisory panel have suggested a $100,000 fee.\Politics have played a role\Bill Guman, a City Council member since 1993, blames the city's inertia in fixing environmental problems on three factors, foremost among them the hill climb.\""In past years, it (resistance to paving) was politically driven,"" he said. ""There were some political ramifications involving the hill climb.""\The other two reasons: the ""huge cost factor,"" and ""interjurisdictional coordination problems"" between the city and Forest Service.\The city says finances are so short that doing the erosion and paving work from the highway's existing $2.5 million budget year after year would take up to 40 years.\Schalk said the highway operation isn't eligible to tap into city tax coffers, because it's a self-supporting enterprise.\As such, it's not eligible for money through the Springs Community Improvement Program, a citizen-based effort that has compiled an $88-million list of projects for an April bond issue ballot question and won approval in November for $6.6 million in other projects.\The city also wants to turn to other government agencies for help, but it may be a steep climb.\Although the city received a $1 million grant to replace the 35-year-old Summit House, it's gotten no funds for the erosion and paving.\It doesn't help that the region's congressional representative is cool to the idea of funding.\U.S. Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colorado Springs, called the Sierra Club's lawsuit frivolous.\""He thinks it will be very difficult to get federal money for the erosion factor,"" said Hefley aide Lee LaMora.\City officials have turned to Gov. Roy Romer, Democratic National Committee chairman, who may have pull within the Democratic administration. Romer wrote a letter supporting the highway erosion-control work, but it's unclear how influential that will be.\The city is doing better on another obstacle.\Relations with the Forest Service have been substantially smoothed out.\""I feel like that based on my experience with the folks with the city, there's a sincere commitment to get the work done,"" said forester Tim Grantham.\In fact, the city has agreed to pay the salary of a Forest Service employee who will concentrate on revegetation and restoration of the highway corridor.\While city officials promise to carry out some recommendations made in the Drexel plan, they're hedging on the most long-standing and controversial recommendation of the plan - paving. The 1997 Drexel study calls for paving or some alternate way to stabilize the road.\The Drexel report calls for a 10-year construction schedule - one the Sierra Club could embrace - but Schalk said the city may be years from getting started.\""One of the key points we want to make is, even if they gave us the money right now, we still have to do the design process, the geotechnical work, et cetera,"" he said.\Indeed, the city submitted a proposal to the Forest Service for drainage-control work in July 1997 and is still waiting for its approval.\The Forest Service, which predicts a decision early next year, blames the delay on government red tape over, ironically, projects that pose potential environmental disruption.\""The more important issue (other than paving) is dealing with the drainage issues,"" Makepeace said. ""Everybody agrees that the drainage needs to be improved. We're as concerned about that as anybody.""\The Sierra Club believes it's been patient long enough. It negotiated with the city for years before filing the suit.\Considering the club's track record of winning many of the dozens of cases it files each year, the pressure is on the city.\Already, major media outlets are following the story, including the New York Times and National Public Radio.\While the hill climb undoubtedly has spread the word about America's Mountain, the lawsuit is doing the same - with more dubious results.\""It's one of those things that, I recently went to the National League of Cities meeting, and everyone knew we were being sued,"" Councilman Randy Purvis said.\""And everyone asked, 'So are you going to pave the highway?'""\- Pam Zubeck may be reached at 636-0238 or zubeck@gazette.com\HISTORY OF THE PEAK\July 14, 1820: First recorded ascent of the peak by Dr. Edwin James of Maj.

149,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."
150,"Big Government proponents, including both Democrats and Republicans, often justify their proposals as essential to encourage technological innovation and economic growth. Far from improving the economy, however, unnecessary regulations and excessive taxes proposed by state, local and federal officials too often serve as obstacles to the creation of new products and services that can dramatically improve the quality of life and boost economic prosperity.\Consider these four examples taken from recent headlines:\- Food truck tax. Last October, food trucks in the District of Columbia began paying a 10 percent tax on everything they sell. This levy allegedly was needed to level the playing field between the new way of eating lunch (having it come to you) and the old way (going to a sit-down restaurant). Who pushed this tax that made food truck offerings more expensive? The restaurant owners trade association.\- Uber Car Service. Uber allows customers to reserve limousines or taxicabs from their mobile phones, which is often more convenient than grabbing a cab on the street. Naturally, the heavily regulated taxicab companies see Uber as potent competition, so in many cities they have lobbied state and local officials not merely to regulate Uber but to put it out of business. The fight is far from over, but the fouryear-old Uber is spending money on lawyers that could have been invested in improved services.\- Internet sales tax. Passed in the Senate last month, critics argue that this tax is being used to hold back buyers from purchasing cheaper goods in the comfort of their own home. Proponents respond with the familiar argument about leveling the playing field, this time on behalf of Main Street businesses. But why not let customers decide whether to shop digitally or on foot? Why inject government as the arbiter of market choices via tax levies, credits or penalties for any of the competitors?\- Hybrid tax. Federal officials enthusiastically push hybrid autos like the Chevrolet Volt and Toyota Prius because they consume less gas and produce fewer emissions than traditional large sedans. But some state governments have gone in the other direction, trying to squash the hybrid car industry. States like North Carolina and Virginia propose hybrid taxes to make up for lost gas tax revenue. So one level of government spends billions promoting specialized vehicles that other levels of government see as threats to their fiscal health. Drivers, who paid more for more economical, environmentally safe vehicles, are caught in between.\In each of these cases, regardless of the announced justifications for their actions, government officials stepped in with measures that limited consumer choice, increased the costs of goods and services and added to the heavy regulatory burdens that slow economic growth and discourage market innovation and progress. Too often in such a politico-economic environment, the difference between winning and losing for everybody involved isn't making more customers happier, but retaining the most influential lobbyists and public relations experts. These considerations should pose a challenging question for recent college graduates who got their degrees but can't find a suitable job in the career field of their choosing: Would they have more opportunities from which to choose if government stopped making so many choices for them? -- The Washington Examiner"
151,"Gas prices are not going to fall anytime soon and will come down only if Americans wean themselves off oil and begin using more alternative fuels, Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Mark Udall said Monday. \Bob Schaffer, Udall's Republican opponent, fired back, saying that several things can be done now to lower fuel costs. \The squabble illustrated one of the clearest policy differences between candidates trying to woo middle-of-theroad, unaffiliated voters for Colorado's open Senate seat. \Udall, an Eldorado Springs congressman, has criticized Republican Sen. John Mc-Cain's calls for a temporary halt in the federal gas tax. \On Monday, standing beside Democratic Congressman Ed Perlmutter of Wheat Ridge in front of a biofuel/E-85 gas pump, he said the way to halt rising gas costs is to push fuel alternatives that are produced in America. This could be done through a so-far-unsuccessful bill to create minimum renewable-energy usage standards for utility companies nationwide, Udall said. \Congress should also redirect subsidies for oil companies to technologies dealing with environment-friendly fuel, he said. \""We have to do much more on the conservation side. That's the American way,"" Udall said at the Hill Petroleum station. ""There's a lot of savings there. There's a lot of jobs to be created that can't be outsourced."" \Schaffer, a former congressman from Fort Collins, responded that there are several short-term solutions to bringing down gas prices. The federal government should sell off some of the supplies in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve and should work with Canada and Mexico to explore ways of increasing North American production, he said. \Udall argued that even if private companies were allowed to drill into all 68 million acres of federal land they have leased to explore, they have not built enough refineries to process the fuel and ease the supply crunch. Schaffer blamed Democratic policies that have increased regulation of refinery construction but have not offered incentives or tax breaks to ease the regulatory costs on businesses. \""The higher energy prices we're paying right now are deliberate,"" said Schaffer, a former energy company executive who revealed in campaign filings last month that he received a $227,000 severance package when he left his job. ""Almost every aspect of these prices is an example of bad decisions made by politicians over the past several years."" \Udall emphasized that because oil and gas are finite resources, Americans have to consider not just the immediate economic consequences of fuel choice but have to think 30 and 50 years out. \-- \CONTACT THE WRITER: (303) 837-0613 or ed.sealover@gazette.com"
152,"DENVER - Formally introducing a centerpiece of their 2009 agenda, Democratic lawmakers Friday unveiled a supplemental transportation bill that its Senate sponsor said would create 10,000 jobs by June while addressing road safety, including repairing 126 bridges in poor condition.\Dubbed FASTER, or Funding Advancement for Surface Transportation and Economy Recovery, the bill would raise $214 million in its first year from road and bridge ""safety surcharges"" on every vehicle registered in Colorado, ranging from $29 for motorcycles to $71 for vehicles over 16,000 pounds. Owners of most cars and light trucks would pay $31 per vehicle. Additional revenues would come from doubling fees for permits for oversize vehicles, increasing fines for unregistered vehicles and a new $ 2-per-day fee on rental cars.\In later years, the typical surcharge would rise to $41 and the total revenue to $265 million. The bill devotes 60 percent of the fund to state transportation infrastructure, 30 percent to city and county road-and-bridge projects, and 10 percent to mass transit projects.\""If we can create jobs while creating a safer environment for everyone in the state of Colorado,"" Sen. Dan Gibbs said, ""then let's do it.""\The bill does not specify which bridges would be first in line for repair. But six of the bridges judged deficient by the state Department of Transportation are in El Paso County, and two more are in Teller.\Tim Harris, a spokesman for CDOT's Region 2, which includes the Pikes Peak region, said he expected that repairs on the eight bridges -- three on Interstate 25 in El Paso County, three on U.S. 24 in El Paso, one on U.S. 24 in Teller County and one on Colorado 67 in Teller -- would be ""accelerated"" if the proposed legislation is passed.\The bill would also create a commission to study mileage-based alternatives to state registration fees and gasoline taxes. The idea would be to replace the 22-cents-a-gallon state gas tax with a fee based on miles driven, measured, perhaps, by something as simple as an annual odometer reading. The problem with such a scheme is that it would not capture miles driven on Colorado roads by out-of-state vehicles, and would not discount miles driven out of state by Colorado-registered vehicles. Vehicle-mounted tracking devices would solve the problem, but at considerable expense.\Gibbs, D-Silverthorne, who is sponsoring the bill with Rep. Joe Rice, D-Littleton, described the bill as ""a work in progress"" and said he welcomed Republican input. But it has no Republican cosponsors.\Republicans have argued that fee increases should not be the sole source of new transportation funding, and that some of the money should come from cuts to other state programs. Democrats want to avoid cutting other programs, especially with the state facing a budget shortfall of at least $631 million in the current fiscal year.\Gibbs repeatedly emphasized that FASTER would put more Coloradans to work. ""This is really our first major economic development package of the legislative session,"" he said.\--\CONTACT THE WRITER: 476-1654 or dean.toda@gazette.com"
153,"Three months ago, Wasson High School student Nancy Lee had little interest in politics or elections.\""I wasn't too interested in voting,"" Lee said.\But Tuesday night, Lee was one of the students from Kids Voting who organized an hourlong televised debate between gubernatorial candidates Bill Owens and Gail Schoettler. Now she's looking forward to voting this fall as part of the student-based voter-education program and later when it counts.\So is Drew Houston, a sophomore at Widefield High School. ""When you vote, you're being heard,"" she said. ""That's your voice.""\The students have been studying elections and organizing the debate since July.\Tuesday night, they posed questions to Republican Owens and Democrat Schoettler before an audience of about 125 other students and adults. The debate was broadcast on KKTV Channel 11.\Among the wide range of topics were questions related to public school class sizes, the minimum wage, racial harmony and the environment.\With their answers, Schoettler and Owens recited many familiar themes from their campaigns.\Schoettler, Colorado's lieutenant governor, supports a ballot measure that would allow the state to spend about $200 million of the tax-limitation surplus on roads and schools. Owens, the state treasurer, wants to give the money back to taxpayers.\Owens supports a tax credit for parents who send their children to private schools. Schoettler opposes such a plan.\Schoettler supports abortion rights, including partial- birth abortion and allowing juveniles to have an abortion without parental consent. Owens opposes partial-birth abortion and supports requiring parents of pregnant juveniles to be notified before an abortion is performed.\But the debate also triggered discussion on several issues that have not been the major talking points of the campaign.\Owens criticized Schoettler for supporting a proposal to open a radioactive waste site in eastern Colorado. He provided a copy of an Oct. 1, 1997, letter from Schoettler to then Energy Secretary Federico Pena urging his support for the project.\Schoettler wrote in the letter that the site could be used to dispose of waste from the former Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility in Denver instead of shipping it out of state at higher cost.\In the debate, Schoettler said the state needs a place to take that waste if it's going to clean up Rocky Flats.\She then jabbed at Owens for his pledge to cut taxes.\She noted that as a state legislator in the mid-'80s, Owens voted for a 3 percent sales tax on food and for an increase in the gas tax, effectively accusing him of hypocrisy.\Owens responded that his intention is to hold down tax rates and make state government live within its budget. He supports a tax cut to eliminate future surpluses.\Andrew Willey, a senior at CIVA, a District 11 charter high school, said he was impressed by the candidates' participation in the student-sponsored debate.\""They were very open,"" he said. ""They were very interested in what we had to say.""\Melissa Hall, a junior at Community Prep High School, said her work with Kids Voting gave her a greater understanding of the political process as well as more to think about.

Results from a survey created by rural Colorado lobbyists show that transportation is important to rural residents.
\
Progressive 15, an advocacy group for Adams, Arapahoe, Cheyenne, Douglas, Elbert, Kit Carson, Larimer, Lincoln, Logan, Morgan, Phillips, Sedgwick, Washington, Weld and Yuma counties, released results from a survey it conducted in conjunction with two other groups representing rural Colorado: Action 22 (southern Colorado) and Club 20 (Western Slope).
\
The three rural groups, along with Metro Denver Mayors, formed the MPACT 64 coalition, where they discussed transportation issues.
\
According to the release, recent transportation polling results contradicted the long-held view that rural residents hold transportation as important and ""they are willing to identify ways to fund road maintenance and safety measures in those areas.""
\
That led the rural organizations to put together a survey that they sent to their constituents. They received more than 400 total responses from residents in all but eight counties in the state that they say uphold the idea that rural residents would support a tax increase to fund road maintenance and safety measures in rural Colorado.
\
""The three rural organizations recognize that, in the scheme of things, the survey results would not be considered 'scientific,'"" the report states. ""However, it is interesting to note that survey participants were not only those that think about transportation every day but included educators, engineers, certified nursing assistants, accountants and home makers who took the survey along with many others.""
\
The overall survey responses rank transportation third on a list of what state spending priorities should be, behind education and business/jobs. The other responses were, in order, health care, environment, and corrections/prisons. The breakdown of responses by area show the answers from Progressive 15's represented counties differ only in the No. 1 and No. 2 spots.
\
Respondents were also asked to rank how important transportation is to listed parts of the economy. The Eastern Plains responses list it as most important to agriculture, followed by energy, economic development, quality of life, health care and education.
\
All of the areas were consistent in the top two responses to the question on how transportation dollars should be spent. Maintenance topped the list, followed by safety.
\
In total, nearly 64 percent of survey respondents said they were willing to pay more money for transportation to improve the state system; in the Progressive 15 territory, about 58 percent said yes.
\
An increase to the gas tax was the most popular mechanism for raising transportation funds, with almost 61 percent from Progressive 15 survey responses willing to consider such an increase.
\
""Given the results of the Action 22, CLUB 20, Progressive 15 survey, these three organizations will continue to advocate for increasing transportation funding in the manner reflective of their member responses. The rural advocacy groups will continue to work with transportation partners to educate Coloradans on transportation issues with the goal of improving transportation funding on a statewide basis,"" the report states.

155,"CONTRIBUTIONS SLOW/ Report unfairly characterized donations\Yes Santa, Virginia bites the hand that feeds her. Shame on The Gazette. On Jan. 10, The Gazette took the generous past deeds of MCI WorldCom and tried to turn them into extortion (""MCI WorldCom cuts back grants""). The Gazette elected to humiliate MCI WorldCom because it did not elect to continuously fund certain agencies to which it had once been generous. So much for spreading the wealth around.\This question is meant to be rhetorical, but I think I know the answer already. If someone has a windfall year and makes large donations to these causes but has a reversal of fortune the following year, will The Gazette hang them out to dry the following year when they can't repeat that performance? Or what if they just wish to spread the windfall around. Maybe the organizations should send an annual bill to MCI or, better yet, make their required contribution into a sort of tax. So much for being thankful for what was given.\The Gazette is definitely a ""glass is half empty"" kind of organization and does great injustice to those causes by making them sound like children who, having once received an endowment, feel suddenly entitled to that endowment on a continuous basis regardless of the desires, goals, or situation of the source.\Rodney J. Cleckler, Woodland Park\MILITARY PREPAREDNESS/ Where is the sense in not using weapons?\In regard to the story in the Jan. 5 Gazette about the United States Army's use/non-use of Apache attack helicopters (""Taken out of the fight""): This brings up a major issue for the military where the main weakness is the fear of casualties. I believe that if we spend billions to create Apaches we should use them in combat.\I think the U.S. has forgotten what war is all about. It is about casualties. When people sign up for the armed forces, they should know they might be sent to die. Our nation was bought with the lives of patriots, our nation was held together by the lives of soldiers, and our modern world was won with the lives of many courageous men and women.\We must never forget this, for if the life we know is to survive as we know it, people may have to pay the ultimate price to protect it.\Brian D. McNeillie, Colorado Springs\PERSONAL SAFETY/ Let others know when you go out with someone new\This is a letter commenting on the report, ""No common thread found tying together Colorado Springs' 26 homicides in 1999,"" in the Jan. 2 Gazette.\On thing struck me while reading about these tragic cases. Out of the five unsolved killings, three were women. Why? That's a good question.\They were probably like a lot of us: Single and or separated/ divorced, living alone or with their children. The other thing we all have in common is the urge to go out and start a new life and start dating again. The difference is that these women ended up dead. Wake up ladies of Colorado Springs.\If you meet someone in a bar, convenience store, stop light, or wherever, use your head. Before you go anywhere with them make sure someone else knows. Tell the bartender, a friend, even your neighbor. Get current driver's license and job information. Take the time to be safe and if that person doesn't like it, go home alone.\Remember, there are three more killers of women and they haven't been caught. This is because no one saw them leave with that person, let alone knew who they were. Except the person who was killed. The odds of the killers being caught are slim. My heart goes out to the families. Those women were someone's mother, sister, aunt and best friend.\Sheila Kaye Irvin, Colorado Springs\MEDIA BIAS?/ Gazette's story placement is questioned\As in the past, The Gazette stresses and highlights the really newsworthy items on the front page; ""Oh my heavens,"" a story on horoscopes; ""Get outta her way man,"" a feature on girls snowboarding, in the Jan. 6 edition.\While hidden away on page A5, among the large ads, is a really newsworthy item that impacts all of our citizens and the entire nation (""Group alleges bias in gun control stories""). The U.S. Constitution, principally the Second Amendment to the Constitution, is under attack from the media and gun control groups. The attack is spelled out and certain individuals and media organizations are identified in a report by the Media Research Center, which The Gazette felt should be relegated or buried deep inside the paper without the front page leader. This, while the groups attacking the principles of the Second Amendment, through efforts to influence our legislature adversely in this matter, get top billing.\If The Gazette is truly making an attempt at impartial journalistic excellence, then the facts contained and revealed in this article certainly deserve front page attention more than the aforementioned stories that were highlighted on the front page. Or maybe mediocrity suits The Gazette and it should be listed among the news organizations cited in the Media Research Center's report.\F. Henry Seitz, Colorado Springs\COMMUNITY THANKS\Area residents made holidays nice for sick kids\On behalf of Memorial Hospital and the Pediatric and Pediatric Intensive Care Units, I would like to thank those members of the community who generously donated to the children during this holiday season.

We need to save unspoiled environments now. We know what happens once man gains access: pollution, the legal and illegal killing of animals, fires, and eventually, the large scale exploitation of resources by business interests.\We need to preserve the balance in these unspoiled areas.\Joan Nordberg, Woodland Park\IN RESPONSE/ Tax cut plan is the only real answer to an ever- expanding state government\So, it looks like the supporters of ever-increasing, unlimited government are already beginning the same hysterical tactics against the new TaxCut2000 plan they used to try and scare everybody about the Taxpayer's Bill Of Rights. The Gazette report of Jan. 3, ""Bruce ads: Help! I'll pay!"" notes that the analysis done by the Legislative Council shows that the TaxCut2000 initiative would force ""lawmakers to cut about $851 million from the projected budget by 2004.""\What the story failed to state clearly is that $851 million is the cumulative figure, not for one year. And that by 2004 total state revenue will exceed $18 billion per year. Even if one assumes the state figures are correct, that means that total government revenue will have grown more than $5 billion dollars from the current fiscal year. So the TaxCut2000 impact is only an average of a little more than $212 million per year. TaxCut2000 is barely a tiny dent in the growth of state government.\And we have the lame duck, statist Sen. Ray Powers making some of the more ridiculous statements of the year: ""Being a Republican, I have no problem with cutting taxes. But you have to do it in a manner that doesn't do too much damage to the state."" What taxes have you cut lately, senator? The legislature and the governor have done nothing in the last three years and have nothing planned for the future. They keep trying to portray the legislative mechanisms they have passed or proposed as tax cuts, rather than as mechanisms to refund the excess revenue the state has been and will continue collecting. The refunds are not tax cuts granted by the legislature, but refunds of excess revenue voters granted themselves when TABOR passed in 1992. TaxCut2000 is the only real tax cut currently being proposed. Powers and the rest of the big-government statists of his party appear to not be Republicans and definitely not for smaller government or even slowing government growth. More hypocrisy and attempting to trade on the accomplishments of others is what they appear to stand for.\Powers went on to raise the specter of some vague impact on roads. What balderdash. TaxCut2000 does not affect the state gas tax which is dedicated for roads. It is a $25 tax cut for utilities, vehicles, income and property. The kind of tripe Powers and the other statists and liberals are serving up we do not need. Find out the facts by going to the TaxCut2000.com Web site, e-mailing taxcutter@msn.com, or calling (719) 550-0010.\This is the first time in the history of Colorado that the voters will get to vote on their own, real tax cut. Do not hesitate. Carry a petition and gather the signatures.

156,"We can all agree that traffic is becoming a problem in Fort Collins. The proposed Referred Issue 2C on the city's November ballot is the wrong answer. \Issue 2C is a convoluted attempt to patch road problems without addressing the cause, sprawl, defined by growth absent of planning, efficiency or productivity. \Twenty years ago we laughed at the idea of someone commuting to work from Fort Collins to Denver. I remember as a college student the only car I could afford was a '72 Plymouth Fury because no one in his or her right mind would purchase a gas-guzzler unless they were mega rich or ultra poor. Supposedly we had learned from the oil embargo, but today boxed by huge SUVs, with bumpers raised as the blade of a guillotine, their windows higher than the roof of my car, I drive with the feeling I'm in a fog. \Issue 2C is wrong because it will not change bad behavior. It will not influence the way we develop our communities or the mode of transportation we utilize. Issue 2C buries the proposed taxes so that there is a disjoint. \The idea behind this tax seems to be a little bit here, a little bit there, spread out, so we don't notice. That's what's wrong. These scattered taxes aren't targeted or progressive. They don't target the cause and there is no return for being a good citizen. \The answer is taxing gasoline. Using U.S. Department of Transportation figures, a 5-cent tax on gas in Fort Collins would raise more than $$@$!3.5 million a year. \This tax would be progressive in nature, because it would discipline those who use the system in an inefficient way and reward those who use the most efficient means of travel, be it an economical car, the bus system or a bicycle while providing funding to not only fix our transportation needs but plan for the future. \City officials say state law prohibits cities from imposing gasoline taxes. But implementation of a gas tax passed by a home-rule city such as Fort Collins has not been tested in Colorado courts. \How will this cost you? Using the base cost of 1.50 a gallon and then adding a 5-cent tax, a car that gets 14 miles per gallon would have to get 14.5 mpg to make up the equivalent tax increase. For most of us, it would mean checking the air in our tires more often. \Would this tax drive you to spend the time and travel to buy gas outside Fort Collins? \I will admit gas is an emotional issue, but the cost on a 20-gallon fill-up would amount to $$@$!1. \Ranked as an industrial nation, the U.S. has by far the cheapest gas in the world. \The price we pay does not reflect its true expense and associated damage to the environment. In a perfect world it would make sense to institute this tax in the urban growth areas to pay for capital transportation projects. \Reject 2C and then ask your representatives at all levels of state government to quit pandering to special interests and fund our transportation needs by taxing gas. \Raymond Alman lives in Fort Collins. \Raymond Alman \Soapbox \Topic: Transportation funding West\OPINION; Pg. 8A"
157," More than $2.2 billion in federal money will be available to state and local governments during the next 25 years for a wide range of transportation projects - everything from widening Interstate 25 to building the Rock Island Trail.\ The Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments, a regional planning authority, has made 180 transportation projects eligible for federal funding from now to 2025, including widening the Woodmen Road corridor, expanding Powers Boulevard into a freeway and constructing more park-and-ride lots.\ More than 300 projects were vying for the money, which comes from gas-tax funds given back to states for transportation projects. That money typically pays for 80 percent to 90 percent of transportation work.\ The PPACG acted as the clearinghouse for the funds. Using public comment to create a ranking formula, it listened to citizens who asked that the selections be made with an emphasis on the environment, energy conservation and quality of life. Then it ranked the projects.\ Earlier this summer, it released the list, and this week it published the results of which projects received funding.\ Of the top 50 projects chosen, according to Rob MacDonald, PPACG transportation director, a third are roadways, a third are public transportation and a third are bicycle and pedestrian projects.\ Getting the federal money doesn't mean the projects will be built, he said. Local and state governments still must go through their own procedures to build the projects, such as conducting environmental studies and finding the remaining 10 percent to 20 percent of the money.\ The PPACG's Urban Area Policy Committee will give its final approval to the list Nov. 14. Meanwhile, the PPACG is seeking more public comment.\ People also may comment on a shorter-range list of projects that will likely be built in the region within the next six years. The Transportation Improvement Program, or TIP, is a listing of projects to be built throughout El Paso and Teller counties through 2007.\ The list includes all of the major projects on Interstate 25, Powers Boulevard and Woodmen Road.\ For more information about both Destination 2025 or the TIP list, log onto the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments Web site at www.ppacg.org/trans.htm.\ Meetings will be held throughout the region to gather public comment about the lists and the process that developed them.\ 4-7 p.m. Monday, Fountain City Council Chambers, 106 S.

158,"LindsayRenickMayer@coloradoan.com\With gas prices on the rise, U.S. Republican Rep. Marilyn Musgrave has proposed a way to take advantage of potential future oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to alleviate summer pains at the pump.\Last week Musgrave proposed the Summer Tax Relief in Pumping (TRIP) Act, a bill that would take the revenue from oil companies that might begin bidding to extract oil from ANWR and put it toward offsetting the federal gasoline tax for 90 days this summer, saving drivers 18.4 cents per gallon.\""It's like all of a sudden there's a huge wake up call,"" Musgrave said. ""The price of filling up the tank is getting higher and higher and there's no immediate relief on the horizon.""\Offsetting the federal gas tax captures an estimated $8 billion and will result in various savings depending on the type of vehicle. Drivers of Ford's F-150s, for example, can expect to save $6.57 each time they fill up, while those with Honda Civics will save $2.43.\Currently, oil companies are banned from bidding on leases in ANWR, so the U.S. Treasury would pick up the tab until ANWR becomes open for leasing, which could take a few years.\ANWR drilling has been a subject of longstanding debate, with environmentalists arguing that it will destroy a pristine wilderness area in the northeast corner of Alaska. Eight million acres of the 19 million acre Arctic Refuge are designated wilderness and the area is inhabited by 45 species of mammals.\""Let's not talk about sacrificing our most important wildlife lands to deal with gas and transportation issues,"" said Phil Cafaro, professor of philosophy at Colorado State University, who has a special interest in environmental issues. ""We can tighten our belts, use some ingenuity. Let's not sell off what makes this country so great.""\Ken Wonstolen, vice president of the Colorado Oil & Gas Association said Musgrave's bill may be less about lowering gas prices and more about promoting the opening of ANWR to development, which is an action he supports to decrease reliance on foreign oil.\""I truly believe that'd be a good thing for the nation to do that,"" Wonstolen said. ""Failing to do that indicates a lack of seriousness surrounding the energy issues we face.""\According to the ANWR.org, a grassroots organization working to open ANWR to oil exploration, 1.5 million acres are being considered for development and if oil is discovered, 2,000 to 5,000 acres would actually be developed. Musgrave calls this a small footprint on the reserve.\""People are starting to get real about drilling at ANWR,"" Musgrave said. ""As they have a reality check every time they fill up the tank, they're getting serious.""\But Fort Collins Democratic Rep. Angie Paccione, who is running against Musgrave in the Fourth Congressional District this fall, called the proposal an attempt to ""buy off consumers so we can go drill in ANWR"" and compared the idea to the scuttled $100 payment to consumers floated by Republican lawmakers earlier this year.\""We just can't drill our way to energy independence,"" Paccione said.\Paccione recommended turning to renewable and alternative energy sources. She said Colorado has resources to become the nation's first energy independent state.\Cafaro said he'd rather see the federal government tax oil companies or set a cap on gas prices.\""It's a tricky thing because probably the best thing for the environment is high gas prices,"" Cafaro said. ""As prices go up, people tend to use less."""

While there are questions about the technology and its cost, the research and findings thus far are promising. A system as complex as missile defense is inherently expensive, but will enable us to defend our nation against enemy attack.\ 3.

The purpose of a public university is to be available to the general public. The real problem is that many legislators expect public institutions of higher education to do everything with tuition and other private sources of revenue. In fact, adequate public funding is essential.\ 3. Basically, this strategy meets the demands of the current economy.

Spending priorities, not spending limits, should determine the amount of investment made to assure quality education for state residents.\ 3.

In county court, we instituted a FAST-TRACK program for misdemeanor domestic violence cases. Roughly half of the 300 cases per month are now concluded with one court appearance. In district court, all but two courts are now ""double-teamed"" by prosecutors to reduce the caseload. And Drug Court combines treatment with accountability.\ 2. I favor single-judge sentencings. Part of the duty of the judge or jury is to determine witness credibility. This requires watching witnesses and listening to their tone. A judge who did not sit through the trial cannot get the same information from a cold transcript. Also, we ask our judges to live in the communities they serve to be accountable to those citizens. But with a three-judge panel, the situation has arisen where the panel members did not come from the jurisdiction where the case occurred. This seems to be a contradiction to the requirement of residency.\ 3. Felonies are becoming more complicated to prosecute. We are finishing one death-penalty case and starting another. Gang-involved cases require extensive investment of time and effort to locate and get cooperation from witnesses. As computer crime becomes more prevalent, the cost of prosecution skyrockets. Demand for additional resources occurs at the same time as tax revenues are being drastically reduced. We must be prepared for cuts in services if the revenue trend is not altered.\ Colorado Senate\ District 10\ DOUGLAS BRUCE\ Party: Republican\ Age: 50\ Education: Bachelor's degree, Pomona College, 1970; law degree, University of Southern California, 1973\ Employment: Deputy district attorney, 1973-79; real estate investor\ Political experience: Author of 1991 Colorado Springs tax limits and tax cuts and 1992 state Taxpayers Bill of Rights Amendment (TABOR); author of TaxCut2000 on Nov. 7 ballot\ To reach him:\ Phone: 550-0010\ E-mail: Taxcutter@msn.com\ Web site: www.DouglasBruce.com\ Answers:\ 1.

I support greater accountability, more discipline, fewer administrators, return to basics and competition. Children should attend whatever school (governmental, private, parochial, home) their parents choose. Funding should follow the child; rigid bureaucratic and union rules should not. Let's free children from failing schools.\ 3. Government is too big, powerful, wasteful, intrusive and clumsy. It should return to its limited, constitutional role and do those few tasks well.

The current plan that's been implemented through the governor is worth looking at closely. However the results of that remain to be seen. If what we've implemented doesn't prove to work, then we need to fine-tune it and perhaps try some other measures.\ 3. In rural areas, we have plenty of room for growth and economic development.

Progress is being made in choice for parents, testing student achievement, and accountability of the system. We still need to spend less money on administration and much more on teachers. Of the roughly $150,000 spent per year, per classroom, the teacher's package is only about $40,000. The balance goes to everything else. That's crazy!\ 3. Growth control should be addressed at the local level. The state government must not mandate controls onto local governments.

Increasing state funding for buildings, teacher salaries, textbooks, school supplies, and technology for ALL school districts (rich and poor) is an investment worth paying for.\ 3. Voter apathy and alienation. Our technology-rich state can lead the nation in creating a more informed and involved electorate via the Internet.

""Solving"" the overgrowth problem means planning for and building the necessary infrastructure and transportation systems to support the current and future population.\ 2. We have moved in the right direction for our children. Colorado has increased funding levels, developed accountability and increased the education choices for parents and students. Increased accountability provides parents with essential information on academic performance, school safety and teacher quality.\ 3. Overgrowth. We are now reaping the results of a two-fold problem. Budgets for infrastructure and transportation projects have been dwindling during a time of unprecedented growth and demand. We must increase resources to improve these areas if we are to maintain and improve Colorado's quality of life.\ District 16\ WILLIAM ""BILL"" YOUNG\ Party: Democrat\ Age: 38\ Education: Bachelor's degree, University of Southern Colorado, 1992.\ Employment: Y.O.U.N.G.S.

We need to plan the growth of communities with long-term plans. This needs to be done at the local level. I would like to see voluntary green-belting for the state.\ 2. No. One test is not the way to judge schools. We need to look at SATs; school drop-out rates; college acceptance records; Multiple tests; and improvement from one year to the next for the student.\ 3. Education needs major reform that holds teachers accountable as well as the students. We need to properly fund education and introduce state-of-the-art teaching techniques to the school districts.

Growth is best managed at the local (city and county) levels, not at the state level.\ 2. Yes, school reform is headed in the right direction with Senate Bill 186, especially since the education establishment has resisted every previous attempt. We will need to do some fine-tuning on SB186 as time unfolds, perhaps in the next or following sessions.\ 3. The major issue is the abuse of the initiative.

The effects of rapid growth are causing problems in Colorado. We need to encourage economic development inside the city limits, especially in districts like mine. It is the sprawl that is costing taxpayers. Government can create incentives for smarter growth patterns that make providing services less costly.\ 2. Senate Bill 186, the ""report card for schools,"" falls short of what is needed to help our students succeed. Reforming education in Colorado must begin with lowering class size. Statistics show that this assists in decreasing discipline problems in the classroom and improved scores in math, reading and science.\ 3. We need to balance our taxing structure so we can protect the future of our kids' education and the investments of Colorado residents and businesses. Allowing residents to keep more of their dollars will enable them to make important personal investments in their own lives.\ MARK CLOER\ Party: Republican\ Age: 32\ Education: Associate's degree, Tulsa, Okla., Junior College, 1994; graduate of Academia Hispano Americana, Mexico, 1987\ Employment: Summer school teacher, Mountain Side Elementary School\ Political experience: Precinct chairman, 1995-2000; county and state assembly delegate, 1986, 1998 and 2000; campaign manager for State Sen.

For the first time, parents will know how well their children's school is performing. We have set high educational standards in Colorado. Now we must be sure to provide the school districts with the proper tools to improve the quality of public education.\ 3. Colorado's tax structure is imbalanced.

Growth that is not managed is a problem. Local communities should encourage development that\ is people-centered, not automobile-driven. Local communities need to work with developers and business to plan schools, open space, roads, public transportation and water use to accommodate rational growth.\ 2. Colorado is not adequately addressing school reform. The CSAP alone is not a good indicator of how schools, and therefore the students attending them, are performing. It is fiscally irresponsible to spend money issuing report cards for schools. Those are dollars better spent improving facilities, lowering class sizes and buying new textbooks.\ 3. A major issue facing all of Colorado is quality, affordable health care. We need to work with providers and the federal government to ensure access for all our citizens to basic, decent health care.

Not actually. We can grade schools and hold districts accountable and it will help some, but long-term improvement will only come when the C.D.E. and the Legislature direct their attention to the 30 percent of Colorado children who are having difficulty and provide the remedial instruction necessary to get the job done.\ 3. I have a growing concern that record-high gas prices are going to impair our ability to repair and build highways. Colorado's gas tax is at 22 cents a gallon, and higher gas prices will translate to drivers buying less gas and fewer dollars into the Highway Users Tax Fund.\ DAVID STENCE\ Party: Republican\ Age: 54\ Education: Attended Central Christian College of the Bible, 1964- 65\ Employment: Program director of Juvenile Treatment Facility\ Political experience: Alternate to Republican County Assembly, state delegate\ To reach him:\ Phone (719) 382-9746\ E-mail: StenceYourVoice@aol.com\ Answers:\ 1.

I support tax credits to teachers.\ 3. Growth: State government must provide the transportation systems necessary to handle the traffic.

Colorado Springs' government knows what is best for Colorado Springs ... not Denver. Gov. Owens has it right: tax incentives, not mandates.\ 2. Generally, yes. Making schools accountable to parents will create competition, which in turn will refocus public education on the fundamentals. We must promote more choices and options for parents, including private, parochial or homeschooling. These children are not the responsibility of the state; they are the responsibility of the parents.\ 3. The public education system ... even more than roads. We must provide options for parents to decide what is best for their children. I ask you to ponder this question: Why do we need school districts with 30,000 children?

I don't believe growth should be artificially limited, but the infrastructure and open space plans should be an integral part of local planning.\ 2. Senate Bill 186 may increase accountability but it is flawed in how it grades schools and in its assumptions that charter schools can do better in areas where socio-economic status contributes to the low achievement of children. Changes in the grading system, reward for achievement plan and charter schools assumptions are needed.\ 3. If school-of-choice laws are passed that require every school that accepts tax dollars to abide by the same state and federal laws and provide the same testing for its students, this will actually strengthen public education and improve the ability of our public education teachers to require participation and accountability from the parents.\ District 44\ VIC MEYERS\ Party: Democrat\ Age: 32\ Education: Bachelor's degree, University of Southern Colorado, 1995.\ Employment: Corrections officer\ Political experience: Ran unsuccessfully for House District 44 in 1996 and 1998; executive committee, Pueblo County Democrats\ To reach him:\ Phone: (719) 485-0010\ E-mail meyers@fone.net\ Website: www.vicmeyers.com\ Answers:\ 1. Growth is a problem. It should be managed mostly at the local level. The legislature could better serve the state of Colorado by adopting a philosophy that would encourage growth where it is wanted and where there is water. Spreading the growth out to these areas would make us a much stronger and diversified state.\ 2. Gov. Owens is tearing down the public schools in an effort to build public support for vouchers. He should find a way to put more money into the classroom and into teachers salaries. We should strengthen the teachers' position in the classroom by protecting them from lawsuits and give them more control over student behavior. 3. There are several major issues facing Colorado. One is education. We need to start fixing the problems in public education and stop making up gimmicks like report cards for schools. We need to take some control away from the state government and leave it in the local districts where it belongs. Another important issue is the influence special interests have in our legislature. Auto insurance is a prime example. Our legislature should be ashamed of what Colorado citizens pay for insurance. Instead, they give the insurance companies tax breaks that take money out of citizens' pockets.\ LOLA SPRADLEY\ Party: Republican\ Age: 54\ Education: Bachelor's degree, Regis College, 1991\ Employment: Owner Spradley Ranch and a small business\ Political experience: Colorado House of Representatives, 1997- present\ To reach her:\ Phone: (719) 485-3755 home\ (303) 866-3540 office\ Answers\ 1.

Growth should be managed with significant input from citizens to local government and with incentives from state government.\ 2. We made the first step to understand what schools are doing and hold them accountable to teach our children reading, writing and mathematics. Parents will now be able to understand what their child is learning and provide the parenting necessary so that the school can do its job - teach.\ 3. Growth and tax policy are inseparable as a major issue. With strong growth, we have an over-collection of taxes that should be minimized so people can keep their hard-earned dollars.

It's the commissioners' responsibility to prevent the mistakes and bad policy judgments that are tearing families apart because they are poor and/or don't fit government's definition of worthy and good parents.

State building codes are a matter of public safety and are used to insure that your home will not burn down when you turn on the light switch.\ 3. Complaints concerning actions within DHS required the creation of a Consumer Review Panel to review the relationship between the agency and the citizens it serves.

Zoning of all parts of the county is necessary to maintain a process to ensure that all residents have an opportunity to share in orderly use of private property. Building codes are a tool for proper construction of buildings and homes for safe occupation. 3.

The short-term answer is to draw down reserves. In the longer term, we must prioritize county needs and adequately fund essential services. Unfortunately, this may in the future mean we have to cut some services. I personally prefer reductions in nonessential services to a tax increase.\ 2. I support zoning and building codes. They are essential to the long-term health and quality of life of the community. The codes should be the least restrictive possible given that eastern El Paso County has vast open spaces, and restrictions that may be applicable in Colorado Springs are not appropriate for that area.\ 3. The Department of Human Services has a realtively impossible task. On balance, it does an outstanding job in both welfare-to-work and child welfare cases. Much, not all, of the criticism comes from people with a very specific ax to grind and DHS is at a disadvantage because it cannot, due to confidentiality laws, respond to allegations.

Any time a large percentage of citizens in an affected area are against something, it should not be imposed on them by our commissioners. Since state law did not allow for a vote by the people of the county to decide the issue, then it should not have been done.\ 3. DHS is a valuable county department and should be commended for the good things they do.

160,"The next time you're rolling along Interstate 25 - or plodding along, as so often seems to be the case these days - Colorado transportation officials would appreciate it if you would give some thought to the road beneath your wheels.\And as you pass road construction projects, seemingly endless as they are, officials would like you to think about how all that work is funded.\And then they want to you to consider the possibilities for coming up with a new way to fund highway construction and maintenance based on how many miles you drive rather than how much fuel you buy.\The Colorado Department of Transportation is launching a pilot research project on the feasibility of using a Road Use Charge, or RUC, to create a funding stream for roads. The idea is to get away from reliance on gasoline taxes as funding sources.\For years officials have said for years that collections of state and federal gas taxes have not kept up with the need to build new roads or maintain existing infrastructure.\Motorists pay 18.4 cents in federal tax on a gallon of gas; the state tax is 22 cents, a figure that has not changed since 1991. As much as the price of gas goes up and down, those taxes do not.\Increased fuel efficiency in vehicles is a good thing for the environment, but it's tough on budget writers. The number of miles driven statewide - and the wear and tear on highways - continues to go up even as revenue coming in for highways does not.\Greater fuel efficiency is mandated by federal regulations in the years to come. In the meantime, Colorado's population, and the number of miles driven, is only going to increase.\With the gas tax, a low-efficiency vehicle brings in about $22 a month in taxes, according to CDOT. The average-efficiency vehicle brings in $11 month. A high-efficiency hybrid brings in $6.29 a month and all-electric vehicles pay no tax. But those efficient vehicles still impact roads.\So what to do? An option might be charging drivers for miles driven while doing away with the fuel tax.\The study will look at the feasibility of various mileage reporting systems, including participants reporting odometer readings or using GPS-enabled reporting devices.\It also will look at methods for billing drivers for the miles they drive.\Issues such as the fairness of mileage-based charges in terms of rural residents, who have long distances to drive to get anywhere, will be considered.\The study begins this fall and is scheduled to run through spring 2017. A final report is expected to make recommendations to CDOT and the state Legislature.\To get information on the RUC, fill out an opinion survey, and have a shot at volunteering to be part of the pilot program, see www.codot.gov/programs/ruc.\Mileage-based funding is an interesting idea: Like a utility, you pay for what you use.\We'll see how it flies with drivers and officials responsible for building and maintaining our roads.\Kevin Duggan is a Coloradoan senior reporter.

162,"KevinDuggan@coloradoan.com\A traveling road show featuring the state's transportation system and its funding problems is headed toward Northern Colorado.\The Colorado Transportation Finance and Implementation Panel will make a stop in Windsor on Tuesday for an all-day meeting. The session is one of a series held around the state aimed at hearing about regional transportation issues and how they tie into Colorado's overall situation.\The 30-member blue ribbon panel, which was appointed by Gov. Bill Ritter, has been given the mission of crafting recommendations for how the state can overcome the gap between the funding it needs for road and transit projects and the money available to do the work.\The group is looking at many funding options, said state Sen. Steve Johnson, a Fort Collins Republican and member of the panel. Much of the discussion has focused on taxes, either creating new ones or increasing existing levies.\But the public is not likely to support tax hikes, Johnson wrote in an e-mail to the Coloradoan. Any tax proposal would fail in the current political environment, he said.\""I do not believe citizens believe the problem is bad enough to vote for a tax increase,"" Johnson said.\State officials estimate $340 million a year is needed to cover the backlog of maintenance costs on the existing transportation system, said Evan Dreyer, spokesman for Ritter's office.\The Highway Users Trust Fund, which distributes federal fuel tax dollars to the states, is expected to be bankrupt in two years, Dreyer said. Because of improved vehicle fuel efficiency, revenue from state fuel taxes is not keeping pace with maintenance costs brought on by increased driving.\""That is a mathematical equation that ends in disaster,"" he said.\The panel has reviewed 40 different combinations of options for increasing state spending on transportation up to $1 billion a year, Dreyer said. The group's recommendations are expected by the end of the year.\The state needs to focus on finding a way to maintain the existing system, said Carl Maxey, a Fort Collins businessman serving on the blue ribbon panel.\Projected costs for replacing roads and bridges around the state are staggering, Maxey said. The viaduct that carries Interstate 70 across east Denver needs $700 million in repairs alone.\""To me this is a stewardship issue,"" Maxey said. ""If we do not maintain the system we've been given, we are going to lose that asset ... You don't wait until the paint peels off your house before you repaint it.""\The panel will hear from local officials and the public about the region's transportation needs. The public comment portion of the meeting is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m.\Local representatives are likely talk about the failed effort to create proposal for a regional transportation authority, or RTA, to take to voters, said Sandra Hagen Solin, issues manager for the Northern Colorado Legislative Alliance, which is made up of area chambers of commerce.\Interest in RTAs could gain momentum in the years to come, Maxey said, because the state government will not be able to come up with enough money to meet the needs of the entire state.\Local jurisdiction will most likely have to come up with ways to take care of their transportation needs, he said.\Options the funding panel is examining in addition to tax hikes include increased fines for traffic violations and charges on overweight trucks using state highways.\Johnson said the panel should look at bonding issues - such as the TRANS program voters approved in 1999 that earmarked $2.3 billion for projects - as sources of long-term funding.\""So far the discussion I have heard is mainly been on gas tax increases or other increases which I think are doomed to fail,"" he said.\Want to go?\The Colorado Transportation Finance and Implementation Panel is scheduled to meet 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday at the Windsor Recreation Center, 250 11th St. Below are highlights from the agenda:\*8:30 a.m. Coffee and breakfast with local elected officials and the public\*9:30 a.m. Presentations on regional transportation issues\*10:30 a.m. Public comment period; speakers limited to 3 minutes each\*12 p.m. Lunch and polling exercise\*1 p.m. Review of funding options\*2 p.m. Presentation on transportation incentives and land use\*3 p.m. Presentation on Colorado State Patrol proposal to increase traffic fine to fund traffic safety\*Information: www.colorado.gov/governor/blue-ribbon-transportation-panel.html"

Why do good caring people drive around gas guzzling SUV's? Why does the United States, with 5 percent of the Earth's population, consume over 25 percent of its energy resources? My proposal to you is that we do this not because we are very selfish and uncaring, but mainly because we do not pay the real or total price of energy. ""If gasoline is cheap enough to drive a big roomy SUV on my salary, then it's affordable"" (period). However, the earth-shaking finding is that the real cost of gasoline is about four times what we pay at the pump.
\
The external costs of petroleum (gasoline) are those not paid at the pump. External costs associated with petroleum consumption include pollution, urban sprawl, roadways and our military protection of world energy assets. The total cost of petroleum is the external cost plus the average gas pump price. The calculations are very complex and fluctuate widely with every varied application. Yet, understanding of the total cost of petroleum is too important for us to delay until a definitive answer arrives someday, if ever.
\
One of the most thorough resources for the total cost of gasoline remains the 1998 project report, ""The Real Price of Gasoline,"" by the International Center for Technology Assessment (CTA). It is updated here mainly for inflation. External cost of petroleum ranges widely from $873 to $2,684 billion for 2010 in the United States, or approximately $6 to $19 per gallon. The total cost of gasoline calculates to about 3 to 6 times that which we currently pay at the pump. More simply, we are directly paying for only about one-fourth of the total cost of energy. (We and our children will pay the rest of the total cost later on and dearly.)
\
The biggest players in the calculation of the external cost of gasoline are: (1) Environment, Health and Social Cost, (2) Subsidized Parking, (3) Military/Police Protection of petroleum resources, (4) Roadway construction and maintenance, and lastly (5) Tax break subsidies. Within the first category, ""sprawl"" stands out like a sore thumb for having tremendous far-reaching costs that we otherwise would avoid with more dense, urban living. City dwellers generally have a ""smaller footprint"" and utilize more efficient transportation. Also pollution, its resulting health costs and global warming are major factors. Probably the global warming cost is still grossly underestimated, as derived from the 1998 CTA report, which did not have the benefit of recent findings on accelerated climate change. The updated calculation results are summarized on a spreadsheet, ""External Cost of Gasoline,"" available on CityOfLafayette.com/LESAC. (The total cost of other non-renewable energies is probably similarly close to four times what we pay for directly, but that's another analysis.)
\
Then, what does the total cost of energy mean to us? Let me hazard to offer my take. First, our culture will continue to consume ""cheap"" energy resources wastefully as long as they remain cheap in reference to their total costs, (until it's too late). Second, the painful, ""politically incorrect"" inevitable conclusion is that our country must eventually pay much higher energy prices, in order to make enough progress to preserve our decent quality of life. As an example, the other industrialized countries, like Europe and Japan, pay 2 to 3 times the price for petroleum (and over 10 times the gas tax) and are invariably far better at using it efficiently, compared to the United States. Third, because no one wants to pay higher taxes, we need and actually have alternatives that are appealing, (except to the extremely powerful fossil fuel industry). One such alternative may be termed a ""Green Neutral Tax Reform."" Very briefly, it would gradually increase non-renewable energy taxes and return 100 percent of it to the citizens by reducing other taxes, (and improve benefits to low-income individuals). We need to ""think outside of the box"" in such ways to find truly effective solutions in these crucial times. Otherwise, these ""radical"" solutions may seem merely academic or too expensive. That is, until we gain a better understanding of the total or real cost of energy.

164,"* MATTHEW BENSON\MattBenson@coloradoan.com\City Council's 2003-2005 policy agenda will act as a road map for the next two years, but council members disagree on where they're headed.\The council will vote Sept. 2 on the policy agenda, which lays out guidelines and priorities in 11 main areas, including economy, neighborhoods and community affordability. Within those general themes are a slew of proposed objectives - and that's where the council is in disagreement.\One objective, for example, calls for the city to ""explore (the) potential for rental licensing."" Another suggests the city ""consider special zoning options that preserve neighborhood character.""\Councilwoman Marty Tharp said the deterioration of city neighborhoods has become a pressing problem, especially near the Colorado State University campus. Much of the problem, she said, has come as more homes become rental properties.\""I think it's possible to license (like a) business and have criteria,"" Tharp said. ""If we have proper criteria in place, we should be able to have rentals compatible in any neighborhood.""\But Mayor Ray Martinez pointed to such objectives - as well as another that instructs the city to examine the impacts of implementing a living-wage ordinance - as examples of ""social engineering,"" and generally outside the city's concern.\He called the council's proposed policy agenda the strangest he's seen since being elected in 1999.\""It's so toxic. It's causing too much fragmentation,"" Martinez said. ""I may end up voting `no' on it just because of some of the things in there.""\The policy agenda typically is a document the council can agree on, he said. The 2001-2003 agenda, for example, was approved unanimously.\As written, he said, the policy agenda is ""too far-reaching, too cumbersome.""\""We don't have the staff to accommodate this. It's unrealistic. We can't solve the world's problems in the next two years.""\Tharp countered that the agenda isn't much broader than those of the past, and she said the diversity of ideas will allow the council to consider more possibilities. She said many of the objectives simply call for the council to explore or consider different ideas and most likely won't be adopted.\""It touches on the main issues,"" she said, ""even though some of the targets will be contentious.""\Not all of the agenda is in dispute.\The city's budget and financial policies were given top billing, with the economy not far behind. Specifically, the agenda calls for the city to develop a ""sustainable economic vitality plan"" that would - among other things - analyze changing demographics and economic trends in the city and identify key indicators of a healthy community.\""We definitely have to get a handle on what's going on with our economy and how Fort Collins fits in to the regional economy,"" Councilman Kurt Kastein said.\Maintaining the tax base and retaining quality employers are key priorities of his, as is improving the city's transportation system.\In the next two years, there probably will be another tax proposal for long-term transportation funding, he said. Voters rejected similar proposals twice in the last year - though any new ballot issue would concentrate on roads and exclude the Mason Transportation Corridor, he said.\""It really centers on `Are we doing what we can to be economically healthy to provide the services people want?'"" Martinez said of the policy agenda.\Policy agenda\Themes of the City Council 2003-2005 policy agenda (with selected objectives)\Budget and financial policies\* Form a budget advisory committee\* Re-evaluate the 70th percentile target for employee salaries\Public health and safety\* Aggressively enforce traffic laws within neighborhoods and on city streets\* Explore options for a local detox facility\Economy\* Develop a sustainable economic-vitality plan\* Support appropriate efforts to strengthen Foothills Mall\Transportation\* Explore additional funding strategies, including license fees and the gas tax\* Review transit options and strategies, including transit-system fares\Water\* Analyze water needs at build-out\* Study the environmental, economic and mitigation costs of expanding water storage\Environment\* Promote sustainable practices, including green building techniques\* Explore ways to expand the curbside recycling program\Neighborhoods\* Re-examine policies and increase enforcement of health and safety ordinances, including ordinances on noise and the number of unrelated residents in houses\* Explore increased restrictions and enforcement on parking in neighborhoods\Land-use plans\* Examine and implement improvements to the development review process\* Consider special zoning options that preserve neighborhood character\City governance\* Explore optimum number of City Council members\* Re-examine City Code campaign laws and reporting requirements\Community affordability\* Create a cost-of-living report\* Examine impacts of implementing a living-wage ordinance\Parks and recreation\* Examine options for and impacts of increasing various fees\* Re-evaluate park development and design standards to make them less expensive"
165," If a recently released list of proposed transportation projects in the Pikes Peak region becomes reality, commuters will see a rapid bus system, plentiful park-and-rides and an interstate with a total of six to eight lanes for traffic.\ These are among the top-ranked future transportation projects on a list compiled by the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments.\ Federal gas-tax funds typically pay for 80 to 90 percent of transportation projects, and the local governments pay the rest. The PPACG - a regional planning agency - acts as the clearinghouse to determine which projects get those federal funds.\ Government agencies have submitted 350 proposed projects that are vying for more than $1.5 billion in federal money made available for this region through 2025.\ Of those, only about 100 will get funded. PPACG developed a formula, based on public comment, to rank the projects and determine which ones are in line for federal funding.\ Citizens asked the PPACG to emphasize the environment, conserve energy and maintain the quality of life in prioritizing the projects.\ That's why transit projects such as an improved and expanded bus and park-and-ride systems make up 10 of the list's top 11 spots.\ Several road projects are high on the list, including widening Interstate 25 from Monument to Fountain, upgrading 30th Street between Mesa and Garden of the Gods roads and extending Centennial Boulevard to I-25.\ But high rankings don't necessarily mean the projects will get funded, said Rob MacDonald, PPACG transportation director.\ First, a project must be in the local government's approved plan, and that local government must be able to come up with 20 percent of the project's funding.\ In other words, if the city can't afford to buy 50 new buses for its proposed rapid bus transit service, that project will be dropped.\ The list awaits public comment before it becomes final in November. People will have several opportunities to voice their opinions.\ They can log onto the PPACG's Web site or discuss the issue with officials at an open house/public forum from 3 to 7 p.m. Tuesday in City Council Chambers, 30 S. Nevada Ave.\ To view the list or comment, visit the site at www.ppacg.org/ 2025plan.htm.\ THE WISH LIST\ ""Destination 2025"" is a project of the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments to identify and prioritize transportation improvement projects for the next 25 years.

167,"* BOB MOOK\BobMook@coloradoan.com\As he filled the tank of his Ford Escort, John Sampson said convenience was the No. 1 reason he stopped last week at the Conoco at 3809 E. Mulberry St.\""I live close by and usually come here,"" he said.\Sampson paid $1.79 a gallon for regular, unleaded gasoline - 5 cents less than he would have paid at Mountainway Texaco, 382 E. Mountain Ave., near Old Town.\But the price was 5 cents a gallon more than what Sampson could have paid at other area stations along College Avenue. And $1.79 was a whopping 10 cents higher than it was in Cheyenne, Wyo., where the average price was $1.69.\The average price of gas was $1.80 on Wednesday in the Fort Collins-Loveland area, according to AAA Colorado.\That's dead even with the average price in Denver, but more than Greeley - where it was $1.78 a gallon.\The average was $1.79 in the Boulder-Longmont area. Statewide, the average was $1.83 a gallon - 3 cents more than the national average.\Sampson, a 30-year-old consultant whose car consumes about 20 gallons of gasoline a week, could have trimmed $1 off his weekly gas bill if he drove to the Schrader's Country Store Phillips 66at the southeast corner of Prospect Road and College Avenue.\But there's no telling how much of his savings Sampson would have burned making that extra trip.\Some of the factors threatening to drive gasoline prices to record highs have been well-documented in recent news stories.\Cuts in oil production combined with seasonal demand and political instability in some oil-producing countries is expected to raise Northern Colorado's gasoline prices beyond the dreaded $2-a-gallon threshold this summer.\The rising prices will have economic ramifications, not just for consumers, but for businesses in the form of higher transportation costs and surcharges - which ultimately get passed back to consumers, said Stan Dempsey, president of the Colorado Petroleum Association. The organization represents businesses in the oil and gas industry.\Prices for regular gas have exceeded the $2-a-gallon mark in some parts of the country, including California, Oregon and Washington. Those who use higher-grade fuel in Northern Colorado already are paying close to $2 a gallon.\Northern Colorado's gasoline prices are influenced by a number of lesser-known factors, including proximity to refineries and pipelines, Dempsey said.\Gasoline prices in Colorado are close to the national average because the state has a strong energy infrastructure, including two medium-size refineries in Denver and two in Wyoming, Dempsey said. Four pipelines coming from Kansas, Wyoming and Texas also serve the Front Range.\Access and supply keep the prices down by reducing transportation and tariff costs associated with shipping fuel long distances. While Front Range prices aren't as low as they are in Atlanta and Houston - where there are more refineries and pipelines - they're preferable to areas such as Phoenix where access to supply is limited.\Higher statewide taxes also contribute to the price - explaining why gasoline is cheaper in Wyoming than Colorado.\Colorado gas tax is 22 cents, which combined with federal gas taxes brings the total taxes to 40.4 cents per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. By contrast, state gasoline taxes in Wyoming were only 13 cents a gallon, bringing the total tax burden to 32.4 cents a gallon.\A federal order requiring refineries to reformulate gas bound for Denver and Boulder to meet clean-air standards also is expected to affect prices - although Northern Colorado motorists could benefit from the change, which takes effect in June.\""You might see lower prices in Northern Colorado than in metro Denver,"" said Gerry Faudel, vice president of corporate relations and environmental affairs for Frontier Oil Corp., a Houston-based company with a refinery in Cheyenne and an office in Denver.\Faudel said demand would increase for the lower vapor-pressure product - which burns cleaner but involves a ""more complicated"" production process.\Because the Environmental Protection Agency isn't requiring the lower-vapor-pressure product to be sold here, the supply of gasoline with higher vapor pressure might be more readily available to local stations.\That could mean that motorists from Fort Collins and Loveland would pay less for gasoline than Denver residents, although Faudel isn't making any promises.\""It's a possibility, not a guarantee,"" he said. ""This is certainly a volatile market.""\Dempsey said consumers are most likely to find the best gasoline bargains where there's more competition and less access.\But other variables also come to play.\""What happens in other markets affects this market,"" he said. ""Any problem in the system gets magnified.""\For example, last September, pipeline problems in Arizona had a ripple effect on the price nationwide as suppliers favored markets that were willing to pay more to meet demand.\Jim Quinlan, president of Jax Farm and Ranch, 1000 N. U.S. Highway 287, described the competitive environment among gasoline stations as ""a very free-market system.""\""The primary driving force is the wholesale price and what everybody else in town is selling it for,"" he said.\Jax sold regular gasoline at $1.77 a gallon Wednesday. But Quinlan said retailers are ""running lean"" in their efforts to remain competitive.\""There are times during the year when we make very little money from the fuel,"" he said. ""Last week, we sold diesel for a penny a gallon more than what we paid for it.""\Quinlan added that independent retailers, who are free to set their own prices, look at one another's signs carefully.\""Everybody watches what everybody else is doing,"" he said. ""For a lot of consumers, two cents will make a difference of where they buy their fuel.""\Top 10 ways to save gas\To save a gallon of gas, you probably need to cut about 22 miles of driving from your week. Here are 10 of the easiest ways to save:\1. Use mass transit or carpool.\2. Slow down. Research shows that speeding uses more gas. If your average commute includes 20 miles of highway time, and you drive it at 60 mph instead of 70 mph, you'll save approximately 1.3 gallons of gas in a five-day workweek.\3. Combine errands. Park in a central spot and walk from place to place.\4. Shop online and consider doing other errands online, such as banking, buying stamps and paying bills.\5. Take a smaller car on long trips.\6. Instead of driving everywhere, lace up your sneakers and get some exercise while you save gas.\7. Work from home. If you have a job for which working from home is possible, ask the boss if you can pick one day when you and your coworkers can telecommute to save gas.\8. Have a dinner party. You'll save the miles to the theater and restaurant - not to mention the money.\9. Share school rides.\10. Keep the trunk light. The heavier the load your car has to carry, the more gas it guzzles.\Source: AAA Colorado\SKY-HIGH:\A man prepares to pump gas into his car in San Francisco in this March file photo.

168,"
DENVER -- -- Lawmakers will not get the 60-day period they asked for to review a controversial contract with a private firm to operate and maintain the Boulder Turnpike for the next 50 years, Colorado Department of Transportation Director Don Hunt said Thursday.
\
""The project is too important to delay the close and to accept the risk that would come with a 60-day delay,"" Hunt said outside a committee hearing room in the state Capitol shortly after testifying before the Joint Transportation Committee about a public-private partnership agreement CDOT is getting ready to finalize with Plenary Roads Denver.
\
Hunt said investors are lined up and bond buyers are ready to purchase the debt to finance the road-widening effort on U.S. 36 between Denver and Boulder, in which a managed toll lane will be added to the two general purpose lanes already running in each direction.
\
To send a signal at this point that the process might not move ahead on schedule, Hunt said, could jeopardize the $425 million project.
\
""It's ready to close in the next two weeks,"" he said firmly.
\
But not before a crowd of hundreds turned out in Louisville Thursday night for the second of two town hall meetings on the contract. Turnout was anticipated to be so large that CDOT moved the meeting location to the 128,000-square-foot vacant Sam's Club building at 550 S. McCaslin Boulevard.
\
On Wednesday evening in Westminster, a boisterous crowd shouted at and jeered CDOT officials, attacking the agency for striking a deal with Plenary, a multinational six-company consortium. They claimed the deal effectively privatizes the 63-year-old highway and funnels billions of dollars of toll revenues into the coffers of a private entity.
\
They also criticized CDOT for not revealing details of the contract before it is finalized, and only releasing a summary of it when pressured. CDOT has refused to publicize the entire 600-page contract based on the assertion it contains proprietary financial information.
\
'We can do better'
\
At the state Capitol Thursday, CDOT officials got the chance to defend the contract in front of the joint transportation committee and expound on what they say is the critical role public-private partnerships play in a time of constrained budgets.
\
They were joined by several prominent former and current public officials -- including Boulder Mayor Matt Appelbaum, former Boulder County Commissioner Will Toor and former Broomfield Mayor Pat Quinn -- who said the arrangement with Plenary is sound and well structured even if the effort to explain it to the public wasn't.
\
Hunt acknowledged that CDOT did not do a good job communicating with the public about what the contract with Plenary means. An online petition, at change.org, requesting that state lawmakers get a chance to review the U.S. 36 contract before it closes had gathered nearly 20,000 signatures as of late Thursday.
\
""We wouldn't be here today if we had done a good job on public outreach,"" Hunt said. ""We can do better.""
\
He told the committee that public-private partnerships are vital in an economic environment where CDOT has had to fall back to a ""maintenance budget"" because it's not getting general funds anymore.
\
At the same time, he said, the gas tax hasn't been increased in more than 20 years. CDOT relies on the tax to fund road construction and maintenance projects throughout the state.
\
""We need use the private sector to leverage projects faster and more efficiently,"" Hunt said of public-private partnerships, or P3s.
\
And improvements to U.S. 36 would have been delayed for 20 years had CDOT, through its subsidiary High-Performance Transportation Enterprise, not been able to cobble together a deal that transfers much of the financing responsibility and project risk to the private sector.
\
The U.S. 36 Managed Lanes project is the first P3 for CDOT. Approximately $60 billion in transportation P3s have been completed in the United States in the last two decades, according to the National Council of State Legislatures.
\
Mike Cheroutes, director of the High-Performance Transportation Enterprise, told lawmakers that a lot of misinformation has been put out about the contract with Plenary. He said the document was hammered out over many months, with stakeholders from various state agencies and consultants involved to make sure everyone's interests are protected.
\
Cheroutes said U.S. 36 will not belong to Plenary, the firm will not be able to raise toll prices whenever it wants, state employees will not lose their jobs, there is no non-compete clause disallowing CDOT from building other roads near the highway, and taxpayers won't be harmed if toll revenue projections fall short.
\
""We have continuing oversight abilities,"" he said.
\
'Well written' contract
\
CDOT got some assistance at the committee hearing from Toor, who for decades has worked on mobility improvement on U.S. 36. The former mayor of Boulder criticized the agency for not sharing details of the contract earlier, but he said the managed lanes project was heavily studied over the last decade and determined to be the best way to relieve congestion in the corridor.
\
It will provide riders of bus rapid transit a 24-minute savings over a car traveling in the free, general purpose lanes at rush hour between Denver and Boulder by 2035, Toor said.
\
He also addressed the controversial plan by CDOT to increase the threshold for high-occupancy vehicles starting in 2017 from two occupants to three - known as HOV3. The idea ran up against a lot of resistance among local officials, he said, but in the end it was determined that the priority was to ensure that the managed lanes move quickly, especially when it comes to bus service.
\
And raising the threshhold for high-occupancy vehicles made the financial math work for the project.
\
""We didn't love it but we were willing to support it,"" Toor said.
\
Critics have said moving to HOV3 will dramatically discourage carpooling due to the difficulty of coordinating schedules with a third person.
\
Toor told the joint committee that he is generally comfortable with what he knows about the agreement between Plenary and the state and said it's an effective way to move the project forward in the face of what was a glaring ""financing gap"" to getting the western portion of the road to Boulder completed.
\
""We don't want to see the U.S. 36 project stalled, we want to see it completed,"" he said.
\
Appelbaum said government enters into contracts with the private sector all the time, citing a third party's running of the Dushanbe Tea House in Boulder as an example.
\
""It's done in order to make something happen that wouldn't happen otherwise,"" he said.
\
Compared to a lot of public-private agreements he's familiar with, Appelbaum said, the one between CDOT and Plenary Roads Denver ""is very well written.""
\
Audrey DeBarros, executive director of 36 Commuting Solutions, said it's critical that the managed lanes project be completed successfully and bus rapid transit service along the corridor launch in 2016 as planned.
\
She said the Regional Transportation District has already shown P3 projects -- light rail to DIA, the Gold Line to Arvada and the first segment of Northwest Rail to Westminster -- to be viable undertakings in the state.
\
'Problematic for generations'
\
But Sen. Matt Jones, D-Louisville, who sits on the committee and is one of 14 legislators who penned a letter to CDOT asking for time to review the contract before it is finalized, said what had been a very open process regarding the planned improvements on U.S. 36 suddenly ""veered into quiet land"" when it came time to talk about the financing aspects of the project.
\
He said it's not even clear to him that CDOT couldn't have come up with the money for the second phase of the 18-mile project rather than handing over operational control to a private entity.
\
Jones praised the myriad of local public officials who over the past decade or so put together the plan to reconstruct U.S. 36, but he said the final steps in the process have been messy and unnecessarily so.
\
""Local officials have done a great job, but it's this last piece of it that is problematic and it will be problematic for generations,"" he said.

169,"Label: TELL IT TO THE GAZETTE\Back in 1984 Apple Computer produced the Macintosh, which became the most elegant, easiest-to-use computer ever. At the same time, Bill Gates and Microsoft were producing an operating system (called DOS) that was arcane, clunky, ornery and just plain stupid.\The forces of light and darkness have been thus arrayed ever since.\Bill Gates went on to take Apple's best idea, its graphical user interface, and produce the Microsoft Windows program. But even after improvements, Windows 95 is still Mac '84, only clunkier - and uglier.\In the meantime, unfortunately, Apple's own not-so-wizardly marketing guys committed one blunder after another. The result is that against all logical reasoning, the inferior Windows program won out over the Mac.\Now Bill Gates has ridden to Apple's rescue with a $150 million bailout. Boos were hurled Gates' way at the MacWorld Expo. Those boos, I think, were misplaced.\Gates has ensured Apple's survival, and this assurance will encourage software makers to produce more programs for the Mac - the relative lack of software is the only weakness to owning an Apple product. Now more people will realize what fools they've been fighting their conflict-riddled, crash-prone, need-a-Ph.D.-to-set-up Windows machines.\Wouldn't it be ironic if Gates' move resulted in the Mac becoming the predominant computer? It would be rich, ironic justice indeed.\- Thomas E. Neven\Colorado Springs\OTHER ISSUES/ Did Rosen distort Ben and Jerry's message?\Mike Rosen's comments about the Ben and Jerry's pamphlet harken back to the McCarthy era (""Ben and Jerry's Cherry Garcia is, hopefully, in better taste than their politics,"" Commentary, Aug. 9). Back then, it was common for the accuser to infer his own prejudices and paranoias from an individual's comments, and then crucify that individual as if the inferences were his own. Rosen has resurrected this style in classic fashion.\While I wouldn't choose all of their methods, it is difficult to argue with the basic concepts Ben and Jerry are trying to promote: Support and improve your local community; develop thoughtful opinions regarding how you think your government should function; work to promote a sound environment by direct, personal involvement; promote efforts to minimize the dependency of industry on the military; exercise personal financial responsibility; be a conscientious consumer, and most importantly, take action on your beliefs. If this is left-wing political thinking, I wish we had more of it.\It was Rosen who sarcastically suggested growing and legalizing marijuana; conspicuous consumption while shopping at elite stores; taxes as a solution to social problems; living off welfare; militant attacks on those with different opinions, and letter bombs to foreign governments.\I'd love to see his sardonic comments regarding our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. They could be equally enlightening.\- Rex Povenmire\Monument\Where has storm sewer money gone?\With the city asking for a new storm-sewer tax to be collected from every landowner, I have come to wonder: What has happened to the large sums of money that the developers have paid in storm-sewer fees. These fees average $5,000 per acre and are required on almost every project in town.\This money is to be used to pay for major storm-sewer improvements and the fees are based on the needs of each drainage basin. Some developers have paid for and installed their fair share of the storm sewers and some have paid the fees.\My question to the city is, why do we need a new tax if this money is already being collected from the developers? Does the city intend to continue to collect the fees from the developers and in that way collect double for the same item, or does the city intend on abolishing the developer fee in favor of a tax on all of us?\Given a chance to vote on this new tax, I will vote no, and I encourage everyone to do the same.\- Thomas A. Kerby\Colorado Springs\Loss of view should not concern drivers\I think it's ridiculous enough that the North End neighborhood, buffered from the east side of I-25 by Monument Valley Park and the Parks and Recreation Department, is up in arms about a wall. This wall will add something tangible to the 20 to 50 feet of air (no buildings, no park, no creek) which currently separates the homeowners on the west side of the highway from I-25.\Even more ridiculous: Drivers are concerned they'll ""lose their views"" during the commute; it's clear why I-25 is such a hazardous road. Watch the road, people; it's overcrowded, the city and county are continuing to allow unrestricted growth (or planned gridlock, whichever you prefer to call it), and if you're watching ""the view,"" someone might get killed.\- Angela Doremus\Colorado Springs\Gasoline taxes should go only to our highways\I see that a group of people has gathered enough signatures to put a gas tax for better roads on the ballot - 5 cents per gallon and a couple of other fees. Since I, along with most, think that our roads need improvement, it is tough to argue against their effort.\So instead of doing so, I want to encourage the same group to go forth with another petition - one calling for spending the first 20 cents per gallon that the state collects on roads and only roads, and let me vote on that issue at the same time.\If they expect my yes vote on their issue, then give me the opportunity to vote yes on all gasoline taxes going to roads. What I can't support is another 5-cents-per-gallon tax with the first 20 cents going to the (politicians') general (slush) fund.\- Al Anderson\Colorado Springs\Man may not have been created first\This is in reference to Marie V. Beard's letter (""Should Range Riders remain all-male?"" Tell it to the Gazette, Aug. 7) concerning women and girls trying to take over this ""man's"" world. She cites the creation story in the second chapter of Genesis and states that man was created first and thus has some sort of birthright to pursue all-male activities. However, in the creation story in the first chapter of Genesis, man and woman were created at the same time and given dominion over the earth. The clergy seem to want to ignore this first creation story, but it is there. Since it comes before the story in chapter two, it should take precedence by Marie Beard's reasoning.\Women have always participated, in ""male"" activities, by choice or necessity. Why does Marie feel threatened by women wanting equal chances to participate in whatever they wish? If she doesn't want to, she can stay home.\- Joan & Jim Phillips\Colorado Springs\Maybe Denver should prosecute itself\This is in response to coverage about the $123,000 in fines imposed by Denver bureaucrats on Douglas Bruce. Among other things unmentioned in those reports:\There wasn't any evidence of the interior of the building for which that city fined Bruce; he was fined because punks wrote graffiti on his newly painted, empty building. In Denver's eyes, the victim is the criminal.\Only a landlord can be a ""slumlord""; the building for which he was fined is empty. Any statement that they are ""rental houses"" is untrue.\Bruce was treated as guilty until proven innocent. He couldn't present witnesses or see any of the city's evidence.\The sole purpose of this corrupt charade by the city of Denver was to make Bruce beg for a lesser fine. He refused to do so because he did nothing wrong.\By the way, why doesn't Denver ever prosecute itself for the dozens of empty and unlovely buildings it owns?\- Steve Cramer\Colorado Springs"
170,"DENVER - When Roy Rudolph Romer made his debut before the General Assembly 11 years ago, the first words out of his mouth were: ""I come before you this morning with a good deal of humility.""\Having been in office less than 48 hours, the Democratic governor promised a Republican-controlled Legislature his respect and cooperation. No surprises. No threats. No rattling sabers.\It was a much different Romer - forceful and less forgiving - who delivered his final State of the State address to lawmakers on Thursday.\At the end of an hour-long speech, he tried to cajole, persuade, even shame them into letting voters decide how to spend the state's surplus. He even accused them of ""arrogance.""\Much has changed over the years in the governor - and in the state that elected him.\When Romer first took office in 1987, the economy was in trouble. To push the state out of a brutal recession, he pleaded with lawmakers to rebuild the economy by attracting new business and jobs.\Today, the state is blessed with record-high growth, record-low unemployment and more tax revenue than it has ever known or can legally spend.\And Romer, a 69-year-old Democrat, used his last stand on the bully pulpit to push for investing that windfall into roads and schools to address a crisis created by the growth he so desperately sought in the 1980s.\The state is bound by a straitjacket of spending limits that stifle any attempt to deal with those growth pains, Romer said.\Lawmakers need to put their trust in voters by letting them decide whether they want a full refund or a partial one that allows the state to invest some of its surplus revenue in transportation, schools, technology and child care.\""This is not our decision. This is a decision for the people of Colorado to make,"" he said.\Then Romer broke from his prepared speech to speak from the heart.\""For God's sake, you don't even need to make the decision - all I'm asking you to do is refer it to the people,"" he said.\""Folks, why don't you find a way to trust the people again and give it back to them as to whether we are going to be a mediocre state or a great state?""\After a thunderous applause by his Democratic colleagues, Romer took one last shot at lawmakers who want to give a refund without a vote.\""We're not even going to let them give us their opinion,"" he said. ""That is arrogance of the first order in my mind.""\Romer resisted laying out a specific plan for the surplus, which is expected to reach anywhere between $324 to $360 million this year. It is projected to grow more than $1.5 billion over the next five years.\Experience has taught Romer that any proposal with his name attached to it will be an instant target for Republican lawmakers, especially those gunning to replace him in 1998.\This calculated approach reflects his record of mixed success in persuading lawmakers to put their money where his mouth is.\""We've had some real tough battles,"" said Senate President Tom Norton, a Greeley Republican who is running for governor in 1998. He took office the same year as Romer and respects him despite their differences.\""But I've always found him willing to compromise. We've been able to pull together, at times, to get things done,"" Norton said.\During his tenure, Romer has succeeded in bringing economic stimuli such as the Denver International Airport, the Colorado Rockies and the Summit of the Eight to the state.\While the state's highways have failed to keep up with the number of cars on the roads and schools are bursting at the seams, Romer can take credit for building more prisons than all his predecessors combined.\In an impressive feat of toughness and compromise, Romer won the fight last year to retain a minimum cash benefit for welfare recipients.\He's also been effective in using his executive power to make significant changes in state government.\""He's been extraordinarily successful,"" said Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler, a Democratic ally who hopes to replace Romer. ""When you look at the range of really tough issues he has worked through, Romer has really had his way most of the time.""\He's had his share of disappointments, too.\Romer has pushed for what he calls ""smart growth"" and regional planning, yet the state still suffers from urban sprawl.\Lawmakers approved a gas tax increase for highways in the late 1980s, but Romer had to abandon a 1997 ballot measure to raise it again because of deafening opposition by lawmakers facing an election.\Voters have never given Romer a Democratic majority in the Legislature. And they ignored his pleas to reject ""Official English,"" the ""Taxpayer Bill of Rights"" and ""Amendment 2"" to ban laws prohibiting discrimination against gays.\Romer loaths casino gambling, but was forced to accept it.\""Romer is seen as a popular governor - Coloradans see him as kind of a maverick,"" said House Speaker Chuck Berry, R-Colorado Springs, who is another candidate for governor.\""But when he comes forward with specific proposals - especially more government programs - even he would be the first to admit people don't always see it as good public policy,"" Berry said.\In a state where the governor has little real power - he can't raise taxes or even write the state budget - Romer's most powerful role has been an inspirational one.\His speech on Thursday was at times philosophical, drawing on quotes from Plato and Ulysses, a mother's lament over child care and a plea for strength of character from a close friend dying of cancer.\""I think he has used his office to truly focus our attention on some major issues,"" said Rep. Jeanne Adkins, a 10-year veteran of the Legislature and a Republican candidate for state treasurer.\""It's been a love-hate relationship,"" she said. ""He's chafed under the fact that he has had a Republican Legislature, but this balance has served the state well in the long run.""\To some, it is the end of an era. But most lawmakers doubt they have seen the last of Romer.\There is the possibility of a Cabinet position in the Clinton administration and he already serves as chairman of the Democratic National Committee.\""I don't think Roy Romer has ever given a farewell speech,"" Adkins said. ""He's as energized as ever to take on the battles of public policy in the state of Colorado.""\When the governor took the podium Thursday, he said this was the last such speech he would give - in this century.\""But I think a four-year sabbatical would be very refreshing,"" he added, with a mischievious grin.\ROMER THROUGH THE YEARS\Past State of the State messages by Gov. Roy Romer:\1987: ""Business as usual will not get the job done. We - you as the legislative body of this state and I as governor - must find a way to work cooperatively together,"" said Romer, who stressed economic development as Colorado's economy sagged. He called for improvements to highways, a new airport in Denver and investment in education and the environment.\1992: ""You were chosen to make those tough decisions. If you can't do it, someone else ought to come up here and do it. ... We cannot pay for state support of public schools and adequately fund the other services of state government with our current revenue base,"" Romer said, demanding $200 million to cover a shortfall because of declining property-tax receipts.\1998: ""For God's sake, you don't even have to make the decision. All I'm asking is to refer it to the people so they can make the decision,"" said Romer, urging reinvestment of surplus tax money in roads and schools.\Romer also recommended: increasing the state's child-care credit for low-income families; tax credits for companies that invest in child-care programs; $20 million to upgrade schools' technology; adding hate crimes to the list of aggravating circumstances in death penalty cases.\For more information on this subject, visit www.gazette.com/top.html"
171,"Label: YOUR VOICE/YOUR VOTE\COLORADO SPRINGS\MEASURE 2G\(Sale of Colorado Springs' parking facilities)\SUMMARY:\An initiated ordinance establishing a minimum amount to be budgeted for capital improvements and establishing a capital improvements trust fund by: 1. Selling parking enterprise garages and lots, with use for public parking to continue for 10 years; 2. Placing 25 percent of the sales price in a capital improvements trust fund and returning 75 percent to citizens in uniform electric bill refunds; 3. Investing 5 percent of yearly city spending, plus any parking meter revenue, in the trust fund; 4. Raising the percentage of yearly city spending for capital improvements 1 percentage point each year until 2007; 5. Setting standards for future purchase, support and sale of capital improvements; and 6. Holding a November 1998 election to vote on similar uses for sales proceeds of certain other assets.\KEY PROVISIONS:\Would mandate the sale of two parking garages and two parking lots, with 75 percent of proceeds refunded to residents on their electric bills, and 25 percent placed into a capital improvements trust fund. Sale by auction would occur by July 1, 1998. Unless approved by the City Council, a successful bid would have to equal or exceed the 1997 actual value as set by the county assessor.\Would force the city to invest 5 percent of city spending annually in the trust fund, along with parking-meter revenue. Only the interest earned from the fund could be spent on capital improvements.\Would require the city to increase spending annually on capital improvements by 1 percentage point per year until the year 2007.\Would prohibit the city from issuing debt to build capital improvements.\Would call for the city to submit ballot questions to the voters in November 1998 for the sale of Valley Hi Golf Course, Penrose Stadium and Equestrian Center, Golf Acres Shopping Center, Sertich Ice Arena, former City Hall, Udick Building, former Garfield School, City Auditorium and theater and a Utilities building at 18 S. Nevada Ave. Sales would be conducted by July 1, 1999, with proceeds distributed the same as earnings from parking-facility sales.\WHAT THEY'RE SAYING:\PRO: The proposal sets in motion a long-term plan to pay for capital improvements. Selling assets will put properties back on the tax rolls and broaden the tax base. Assets to be sold represent only 2 percent of the city's properties. It's not right that city ventures compete with private business.\CON: The city has devised a capital improvements plan that will fund $146 million in work in five years - without a tax increase. It involves selling bonds and retaining excess tax money collected in violation of state tax limitation revenue limits. Many assets proposed for sale strengthen vital connections that make this a livable community.\MEASURE 2H\(Exemption for state grant money from state and local tax limitation revenue caps)\SUMMARY:\Shall state grants received by the city during 1997 and thereafter be exempted from fiscal year spending calculations as defined in City Charter Article 7, Section 90 (B)(6) and Colorado Constitution Article X, Section 20 (2)(E)?\KEY PROVISIONS:\Would allow the city to apply for and receive state grant money but not include it in revenue limits.\The city no longer would be put in a position to possibly return the state grant money to the voters in a tax refund if revenue caps are exceeded, or ask permission to keep it.\WHAT THEY'RE SAYING\PRO: Current requirements act as a disincentive on city departments to apply for state funds and grants. The city deserves a cut of state money, such as from the state gas tax fund, which is distributed to each community to build roads and bridges. Projects would be built much faster if the grants could be used for the purpose they were obtained, without going to the ballot each time.\Federal grants, comprised of taxes sent to Washington, D.C., are already exempt from the spending limits. It only makes sense that state grants should be also.\CON: The measure attempts to repeal spending limits forever, which means city voters would give up their right to vote on tax refunds forever. While state tax limitation laws limit waivers of revenue limits for four years, the city wants it to be forever.\There is no limit on how the refund money would be spent. It could go to inflated salaries and to expand the bureaucracy. The city claims to need more money but has failed to spend more than $20 million in excess revenue voters have allowed them to keep since 1994.\MANITOU SPRINGS\QUESTION 2C\SUMMARY:\Shall the city of Manitou Springs be authorized to collect, retain and expend all excess revenues and other funds collected by the city in calendar year 1997, and in each calendar year thereafter, such excess revenues and other funds to constitute a voter-approved revenue change?\KEY PROVISIONS:\The measure would allow city to keep and spend as much revenue as it collects from property taxes, sales taxes, fees and other sources. Eliminates revenue caps created by the tax limitation amendment to the state constitution.\The measure will not do away with the need for residents to vote on the question of any new debt or tax.\The City Council could still refund taxes collected above the state limits, but it would not have to.\WHAT THEY'RE SAYING\PRO: Because of the state's Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, the city must now refund any revenue over a certain amount. This law will allow City Council to spend the money on needed projects, while still holding the option of refunding the money. The city revenues have never exceeded the state-set limit.\CON: Excess tax revenue should be refunded to taxpayers.\WHO'S FOR IT: Manitou Springs City Council\WHO'S AGAINST IT: Tax-limitation author Doug Bruce\QUESTION 2D\SUMMARY:\Shall the mill levy for general ad valorem taxes be increased by three mills, which increase will produce an amount presently estimated to be $85,250 per year, of which increase two mills would be in effect for 15 years commencing with the beginning of tax year 1998 and terminating at the end of tax year 2012, to fund the purchase and improvement of property on El Paso Boulevard for the purpose of parks and recreation, with the remaining one mill to continue in effect to fund the maintenance of the property?\KEY PROVISIONS:\The land, which is the last large portion of creekside land remaining in Manitou Springs, would be used for a skateboard park, tennis courts, a dog run, picnic areas and playgrounds.\For a homeowner of a $100,000 home, the increase in taxes would amount to about $48 per year.\WHAT THEY'RE SAYING\PRO: There is a need for more park land in Manitou Springs, and the property is available for sale at the appraised price of $400,000.\CON: This would be the biggest mill levy increase in recent history. The City Council did not give enough notice for the increase, and the only reason the developer wants to sell is because the property has restrictive floodplain regulations.\WHO'S FOR IT: Manitou Springs City Council, Youth Task Force and many parents.\WHO'S AGAINST IT: No organized opposition, other than people opposed to new taxes.\QUESTION 2E\SUMMARY:\Shall the city sales tax be increased by two tenths of one percent (0.2 percent) for the calendar years 1998, 1999, and 2000 only, which increase is estimated to produce revenues in the amount of $55,000 per year, to be used for the phased pool design and mineral water development of a mineral spring spa pool at the city swimming pool facility?\KEY PROVISIONS\The city's proposal for the pool design and mineral water development for a mineral- spring spa pool at the city swimming pool facility would cost about $165,000.\The increased sales tax would collect an estimated $165,000 in three years.\City officials have agreed to pursue money to finish the project from grants and other sources.\WHAT THEY'RE SAYING\PRO: It's the town's namesake, and there's not even a hot springs in the city. There should be a spring for economic and health benefits.\CON: Residents pay enough sales tax as it is. If there's to be a spring and pool, it should be funded by a private business, not taxpayers.\WHO'S FOR IT: The Mineral Springs Foundation, the Manitou health community.\WHO'S AGAINST IT: No organized opposition, other than people opposed to new taxes.\QUESTION 2F\SUMMARY:\Shall the city sales tax be increased by two tenths of one percent (0.2 percent) for the calendar years 1998, 1999 and 2000 only, which increase is estimated to produce revenues in the amount of $55,000 per year, to provide funding for the Manitou Springs Design Project Master Plan and construction documentation?\KEY PROVISIONS\Would increase sales taxes to fund completion of a master plan and design drawings for the Manitou Springs Design Project.\Would create seed monies to be used as matches for grant money to fund the construction plans for the project.\The project has an estimated cost of $242,000. Over three years, the tax would raise about $165,000 of that money.\WHAT THEY'RE SAYING\PRO: The goals of the project are to improve parking and traffic; improve landscaping, lighting and benches; create safer pedestrian environment.\CON: Additional sales tax hurts the tourists the most. The sales tax in the city would be up to 8 percent if both measures 2E and 2F pass.\WHO'S FOR IT: Chamber of Commerce; City Council and Manitou Springs Development Company.\WHO'S AGAINST IT: Some business people think the increase in sales tax is not justified. Motel owners tend to be more concerned than retailers. There is some concern over traffic portion of the plan.\PROPOSED CHARTER\AMENDMENT 2B\SUMMARY:\Shall the text of Section 6.9 of the City Charter, which section requires the City Administrator and the Chief of Police to live within the city, be repealed and be replaced with the following language:\Section 6.9 Residency. The City Administrator and the Chief of Police shall, during their tenure in their respective offices, live not farther than 20 miles from the corporate boundaries of the city.\KEY PROVISIONS:\The current law requires the city administrator and the police chief live within the city limits. This amendment would allow them to live within 20 miles of the city limits.\WHAT THEY'RE SAYING\PRO: Increases in property values in recent years have made it difficult or impossible for employees entering either of these positions to purchase a home within the city. Improvements in communications technology in recent years have made the response times of these employees less of a consideration.\CON: These are important employees in city government, and it's important they live in the city. That keeps them in touch with what's happening in Manitou Springs.\WHO'S FOR IT: Mayor Bud Ford; City Council\WHO'S AGAINST IT: Council candidate Nancy Sage-Barnes"
172,"Ben Campbell\Ben Nighthorse Campbell is proud that a Washington magazine has named him one of the worst-dressed members of the U.S. Senate.\""I dress in jeans and boots,"" said Campbell, 65, recently. ""If you think that category hurts me in Greeley, Colorado, you got that wrong.""\Six years after winning his U.S. Senate seat, Campbell hasn't changed his irreverent style, which voters found so refreshing. Even when his irreverence borders on the cavalier.\He can barely name a difference between himself and his challenger in the GOP primary, Bill Eggert.\""I don't even know Bill Eggert,"" said Campbell, who lives in Ignacio. ""I don't know how I differ from him.""\When pressed, he offers this: Eggert ""doesn't want to reduce the size of government; he wants to dismantle it or get rid of it. I don't think that's the proper way to go.""\He quickly dismisses criticism of his legislative record.\""Everything is personally motivated because everyone has an ax to grind,"" Campbell said. ""I don't like that stuff.""\So far, the attitude has worked for Campbell, although it played better with general election voters in 1992 than it did at the recent GOP state convention.\He won just 57 percent of the delegate votes - plenty to win the top line on the ballot but not the overwhelming victory that might be expected of a sitting U.S. senator.\State conventions are supposed to be coronations for incumbent senators, not contests. But Campbell's nomination is not automatic because it's his first race as a Republican after defecting from the Democratic Party in 1995.\""I've always been comfortable as a Republican,"" Campbell said.\While Campbell speaks freely of his dislike for Washington, he said he is anxious to return and use his seniority for Colorado.\""The Senate is a body where seniority is everything,"" said Campbell, who is chairman of the Indian Affairs Commission and serves on the Appropriations Committee.\""That's one of the big differences between me and Eggert or me and anyone else. They're all beginners.""\Campbell is expected to win the Aug. 11 primary, but he is taking nothing for granted.\""I was in sports long enough to know not to ever assume that you've got something won,"" said Campbell, who was captain of the 1964 U.S. Olympic judo team and won a gold medal in the 1963 Pan American Games. ""You never rest, not for a single minute in this business, or somebody will sneak up on you.""\Bill Eggert\The seeds of Bill Eggert's campaign for the U.S. Senate were planted decades ago in the Bronx, one of New York's City's poorest boroughs.\Growing up there in the 1960s, Eggert watched the government spend millions of dollars on federal poverty programs.\What he saw was the growth of a massive and costly bureaucracy, erosion of the self-esteem of the people the programs were supposed to help, and creation of more poverty.\""I saw it first-hand,"" said Eggert, now 48. ""(It was) a devastation of the individual, of families, of communities, and I will never forget that. If you want to know what I'm about, that's it.""\Today, Eggert is a Denver lawyer who put his practice on hold to take on incumbent Ben Nighthorse Campbell in the Aug. 11 primary.\Eggert, like Campbell, defected from the Democratic Party. He presents himself as the conservative alternative.\His agenda is tightly focused on cutting taxes, reducing government spending and cutting government regulations that he says infringe on Americans' liberties. He also favors the GOP's anti-abortion position.\For example, he says federal, state and local government taxes take nearly 40 percent of the median income of a family of four.\""That's oppressive. It's an incredible amount of money, and it robs families of choices,"" he said.\He believes organizations such as churches and synagogues should play a greater role in assisting America's needy. Recipients of such good will, he said, should in turn be required to make some kind of contribution to the community.\Eggert's message of less government and more personal responsibility resonated with delegates at the state Republican convention in May. Eggert, whose candidacy had received little exposure, took 43 percent of the vote.\His campaign has not been especially visible in the weeks since the primary, but he vows that will change.\The former New York prosecutor plans to walk neighborhoods and talk to voters, much like he did in a 1994 campaign against former Rep. Pat Schroeder. Eggert lost that race but won 40 percent of the vote, better than any other Republican had done against Schroeder since 1976.\He also challenged U.S. Sen. Wayne Allard in 1996 but failed to make it onto the primary ballot.\Dottie Lamm\Early on a recent weekday morning, Dottie Lamm, the former first lady of Colorado, was filling coffee cups and clearing egg scraps from plates at a Boulder diner.\The waitress shift was one of several ""work days"" for Lamm, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate.\Lamm, 61, says experiencing jobs held by average people will help her better understand their concerns and problems.\""I'll carry the voice of Coloradans to Washington in a way that just talking at political meetings or listening to interest groups doesn't do,"" she said.\Lamm is making her first foray into politics. But as the wife of former Gov. Dick Lamm and a former longtime Denver Post columnist, she is no stranger to the public and political circles.\Lamm often speaks on women's issues, population and family planning. She served as a delegate to U.N. conferences on population in 1994-95 and on numerous Colorado boards and commissions.\She describes herself as a ""modern Democrat"" who wants to maintain the party's traditional goals but remain flexible enough to change programs that aren't working.\""I take every Democratic ideal and say, 'How does it work for the next century?'"" Lamm said.\In 17 years of writing twice-weekly columns for the Denver Post, Lamm was a strong advocate of birth control and abortion rights. Her major campaign issue, however, is education ""in the broadest sense of the word,"" she said. She wants to expand opportunities for the youngest of students to those who choose vocational training over college.\""Anything the federal government can do to help more public-private partnerships, ways to reduce loans ... we need to be thinking creatively about those things,"" she said.\Lamm is battling Democrat Gil Romero, a Pueblo lawmaker, for her party's nomination in the Aug. 11 primary.\Lamm has name recognition, the support of many prominent Democrats, including Gov. Roy Romer, and is also much better financed than her opponent.\Romero, however, beat Lamm at the Democratic state convention to win the coveted top line on the primary election ballot.\""In some ways, that was a blessing,"" Lamm said of her convention loss. ""That really made us focus on getting the Democratic vote out in August.""\Gil Romero\In his campaign for the U.S. Senate, Gil Romero seems to talk as much about his late father, Henry Romero, as he does about himself.\""Think of people like me and your mom, people of limited means, limited education and limited opportunity,"" Romero said his father told him as he prepared his first-ever political speech in the basement of their Pueblo home. ""If you do that, everything else will come easy.""\Romero, 44, draws heavily from lessons learned from his coal miner father, who died in his arms of a stroke shortly after the younger Romero started his legislative career 14 years ago.\Romero's campaign is directed at people like his parents: people who can't take education, jobs and health care for granted. And while it hasn't come easy, his candidacy has come further and become stronger than many predicted.\Romero is still an underdog in the Democratic primary race against Dottie Lamm. The former first lady of Colorado has raised far more campaign money than Romero and enjoys the backing of prominent Democrats, including Gov. Roy Romer.\But Romero's upset over Lamm at the state Democratic convention put him on the top line of the Aug. 11 primary ballot and bolstered his confidence in the ""high-touch, low-tech"" tactics he has used in the campaign.\""There really was a feel that this was a David and Goliath kind of battle,"" said Romero, who gave up a legal practice eight years ago to join the most powerful panel in the state Legislature, the Joint Budget Committee.\Raised in a poor home by uneducated parents, Romero is undaunted by underdog status. He says he doesn't mind working hard - he took a second job as a supermarket clerk early in his legal career to pay off his student loans - to overcome adversity.\He doesn't dwell on what his campaign lacks but ticks off his resources: ""Excitement, energy and a lot of people. We're making the best of what we have,"" he said.\That means putting his family to work on the campaign and recruiting hundreds of volunteers as his borrowed 27-foot mobile home rolls across Colorado so Romero can run at least six miles in nearly every county and meet voters.\The folksy, grass-roots approach belies the insider's experience Romero accumulated in seven terms in the House, where he frequently backed alternatives to building prisons.\Romero says his legislative experience sets him apart from Lamm, who has never held elective office.\""It's not just being for or against an issue, but taking on the tougher issue of how do you create solutions,"" Romero said. ""People hopefully want someone who's been in the trenches working on these issues.""\- Mary Boyle; The Gazette"
173,"
Westerners inspired by Barack Obama have a right to feel giddy these days: The history-making wave that swept the Democrat into the presidency Nov. 4 had a lot of impact around the region. It lifted a surprising number of other Democrats into offices that had long been held by Republicans, many of whom were seen as obstacles to change. The winning Democrats promise to be better on protecting the environment, more supportive of clean energy and more even-handed on immigration and other Western issues.
\
Obama took six of the 11 Western states, spreading the Democrats' apparent majority inland from the West Coast to include Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico. He did it with a record-breaking $1 billion national campaign war chest, including hundreds of millions spent by unions on his behalf - a huge financial advantage over his Republican opponent, John McCain - and by running the most determined Democratic presidential campaign ever in the West.
\
In Colorado, the Obama campaign had 51 field offices - many in conservative rural areas - and the spark provided by the Democratic National Convention in Denver. Obama himself made calls to potential Colorado voters from a field office in a Denver suburb. Just a few days before the election, he drew more than 100,000 people - said to be the biggest political crowd in Colorado history - to a Denver speech.
\
In Nevada, where Democrats scheduled a primary in early February to spark enthusiasm, Obama made 20 visits in all, including three to the mining community of Elko, where he spoke in the town park and accepted a shirt bearing the name of the high-school football team (the Elko Indians). Nevada State Sen. Dina Titus, a political science professor, told the Las Vegas ReviewJournal that she won a U.S. House seat thanks in part to Obama's ground game, ""the best she'd seen in 20 years of politics.""
\
In New Mexico, the Obama campaign opened nearly 40 field offices. In out-ofthe-way Montana - where Obama came within a few percentage points of a rare Democratic win - he opened 19 and made five campaign visits, and his campaign dispatched Los Angeles Lakers basketball star Derek Fisher to speaking engagements on the Blackfeet Reservation.
\
Obama received more votes than the last Democratic candidate for president, John Kerry, in 404 of the 413 counties in the West, indicating that a new order may be taking command of the region's politics. That impression was reinforced on the congressional level: Western Democrats took three Senate seats that had been Republican (in Colorado, New Mexico and Oregon). They took at least six House seats from Western Republicans, while losing no Democratic seats in either chamber of Congress.
\
Democrats also gained more seats on public utilities commissions in Montana and Arizona, with candidates who vow to put more emphasis on development of wind and solar energy.
\
But Obama's hopeful message, his call for fundamental change and unification, will meet resistance in the West from here on out, especially on the level of local politics.
\
REDOUBTS AND FRAGMENTS
\
Political pundits use a new word when they talk about the post-election Republican Party. They say the GOP due to its hard-line approach to fossil fuels, the Iraq War and deregulation of everything - has had its majority reduced to ""redoubts,"" mostly in Southern states. ""Redoubts,"" according to Merriam-Webster's dictionary, are small, enclosed defensive positions.
\
But the redoubts aren't all in the South; the West has a significant number. Utah, Idaho and Wyoming haven't voted for a Democrat for president since 1964, and this time, they were among the top states in voter percentages for McCain.
\
Conservative religious voters are largely responsible for the redoubts in those states. On average, the most conservative voters are either evangelical Christians or Mormons, whose politics tend to center on opposing abortion and gay rights. About 60 percent of Utah adults are Mormon, and 45 percent of Idaho adults are either Mormon or evangelical; the only other states with totals so high are in the South. Politically, Utah and Idaho might as well be Southern states.
\
Mormon voters comprise 10 percent of the Wyoming electorate, and Republican Cynthia Lummis, a conservative Lutheran, made a point of reaching out to them in her winning campaign to be the state's next representative in the U.S. House. (She's replacing Republican Rep. Barbara Cubin, who didn't run for re-election.)
\
The politics in other Western states remain fragmented by similar hard-line Republican redoubts. In the West's liberal-majority coastal states, the redoubts are inland. In Washington, for instance, two-term incumbent Republican State Lands Commissioner Doug Sutherland, a friend of timber and mining companies, just lost to Democrat Peter
\
Goldmark, a rancher and Ph.D. molecular biologist who promises to have better environmental protection policies. That job manages 5 million acres of Washington's state land and logging on private land. Sutherland carried the inland counties, Goldmark carried the coastal urban areas.
\
In general, Western cities, college towns and resort towns tended to vote for Obama, while the rural areas went for McCain. Even in Nevada, where Democratic Sen. Harry Reid has led a revival of his party - there are now 100,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans - Obama won by carrying the urban slivers of metro Las Vegas and Reno, even though he lost in the rest of the state.
\
In Arizona, even as Democrats based in Flagstaff and the Navajo Nation gained congressional seats, voters in the Phoenix suburbs re-elected famous anti-immigration Republican Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Araipo to a fifth term; the sheriff promptly vowed to continue his raids on businesses and local governments that hire undocumented immigrants. Arizona voters also rejected a ballot measure that would've relaxed the state's tough penalties against businesses that hire undocumented immigrants.
\
In western Colorado, Ed Marston, High Country News' former publisher and a longtime political centrist, invested more than a year in running as a Democrat for a seat on the Delta County Commission. Competing on strongly Republican turf, Marston was smeared by ads claiming he would flood the area with illegal immigrant criminals and squash gun rights, even though he'd tried to take the gun issue off the table by getting a concealed weapon permit. He lost by a 2-to-l margin - a typical fate for local Democratic candidates in Republican strongholds on the state's rural Western Slope.
\
GRIDLOCK, SLAM-DUNKS AND CONTRADICTIONS
\
In the legislatures, Republicans still control both chambers in Arizona, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming. In fact, some of their locks got tighter in this election. Montana Republicans, led by hard-liners, effectively gained control of their Legislature. That means state politics in those legislatures will likely be disconnected from federal politics - a common problem in Western states - because the Democrats hold Congress and the White House. Meanwhile, Democrats have a lock on legislatures in California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington.
\
In six of the states with such oneparty locks, the governor belongs to the same party. Such complete dominance encourages show-offish slam-dunks rather than a politics of compromise and consensus.
\
In states where the governor belongs to the opposite party from the legislature's majority, the difference frequently means gridlock. Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat dealing with a Republican Legislature for her six years in office, has vetoed more than 170 bills that took hard-line stances on immigration, gun rights, abortion and other issues. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican dealing with a hard-line Democratic Legislature, vetoed more than 400 bills this year alone, setting a new California record. Such collisions can eventually force consensus, but they waste a lot of time and effort.
\
Many more of the Western election results seem contradictory. Religious conservatives succeeded in writing bans on gay marriage into the California and Arizona constitutions. But they lost in Colorado, where voters rejected a tough anti-abortion measure, and in Washington, where voters OK'd a ""Death with Dignity"" measure that allows doctors to prescribe lethal drugs to terminally ill patients who want to kill themselves.
\
Earlier this year, Colorado agencies, spurred by the Legislature, imposed tough environmental regulations on oil and gas companies. But the voters decided not to impose higher taxes on those companies, even though Colorado's oiland-gas tax rate is lower than the rates in neighboring states. Colorado's infrastructure and its public colleges have been strangled by a tax-limit passed in 1992, but voters also rejected a measure that would have relaxed that chokehold. Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter and some moderate Republicans and business groups backed both of those pro-tax measures.
\
TREND TOWARD PRAGMATISM, MAYBE
\
Some Western extremists were knocked out of office - most notably, Republican Idaho Rep. Bill Sali, who was famously called an ""idiot"" by one of his party's leaders. But high-profile moderates also got booted out of federal and state offices, including Oregon's Republican Sen. Gordon Smith. And at least one extremist won a congressional seat: Jason Chaffetz, who defeated incumbent Utah Rep. Chris Cannon in the Republican primary, will take his uncompromising anti-immigration, antitax views to the U.S. House.
\
Wyoming's new Republican Congresswoman, Lummis, thinks the science isn't yet clear on global warming and wants to extend the Bush tax cuts despite a federal budget deficit bigger than the (shrinking) polar ice cap. Democratic Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels, a few days after the election, vowed to continue pushing for a ban on handguns in city parks and buildings, despite opposition from his state's attorney general as well as from the hundreds of thousands of Washington voters who are staunchly for gun rights.
\
Even so, there is an apparent trend in the West toward pragmatism and populism, and voters seem eager to protect or improve local amenities and services.
\
In Sevier County, Utah, voters took a step toward voting down a Nevada company's plan to build a coal-fired power plant in the county: They OK'd a ballot measure that gives them the right to make the final decision. That battle extended as far as the Utah Legislature (which earlier passed a law saying the locals couldn't exercise such power) and the Utah Supreme Court (which ruled that the law was unconstitutional).
\
The animal-rights movement made progress in California, where voters overwhelmingly approved a measure to require more humane conditions for factory-farm chickens, pigs and calves. (Arizona, Colorado and Oregon have already passed modest versions.) In Utah, voters in metro Salt Lake County OK'd new taxes for improvements to the county's 48-acre zoo and 8-acre aviary, including new jungle exhibits with birds from Latin America.
\
Open-space ballot measures continued to be popular: There were 17 major proposals to impose new taxes for buying open space lands and improving parks in the West, and voters OKd 14 of them, according to the Trust for Public Land, which worked on many of the proposals.
\
Mass transit also continued to be popular: Voters in California, Seattle, Wash., and northern New Mexico approved new taxes to expand commuter rail and bus systems. California's proposal is especially ambitious: The state plans to issue nearly $10 billion in bonds for a down payment on building a highspeed rail network linking Los Angeles to San Francisco and Sacramento.
\
Among the other reasons for Obamaesque optimism: American Indians won 10 seats in Western legislatures. Denise Juneau, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Ankara tribes, fended off racial slurs to earn a statewide office, Montana school superintendent. Lena Fowler, a Navajo, won a seat on the Coconino County Board of Supervisors in Arizona. Todd Gloria, of the Tlingit-Haida tribes, won a seat on the San Diego, Calif., City Council.
\
In another sign of diversity, wealthy Internet entrepreneur Jared Polis won the U.S. House seat representing the liberal enclave of Boulder, Colo.; Polis is the first openly gay man elected as a freshman congressman. (Other gays in Congress have come out after they were elected.)
\
LOOKING AHEAD
\
On the horizon, the Obama wave may lead to future Democratic wins in the West and increasing political alignment of moderates in both parties. Young voters (under 30 years old) went for Obama 2-to-l, as did Latino voters (another fast-growing segment of the electorate).
\
But in the short term, it will be difficult for the region - and for any particular state - to truly unify around any plans to address today's huge crises, including the global economic meltdown. Many people in the Republican redoubts approved of the Bush administration's relaxation of environmental regulations, and they're already wary of Obama's plans to restore such rules.
\
Some of the new players appear determined to find middle ground. Oregon's new senator, Jeff Merkley, is the ""son of a millworker (and) the first in his family to attend college,"" says the Associated Press. Merkley has proven effective as a leader in the Oregon Legislature, pushing for living wages, affordable housing and consumer protection; AP calls him a ""populist.""
\
The new Democratic congressman from southern New Mexico is oilman Harry Teague. He's a high-school dropout who earned his money in an oilfield services business, and he gives his employees good benefits, including college tuition and health insurance. He calls himself a pragmatic populist.
\
Idaho Democrat Walt Minnick won the House seat that had been held by Bill Sali. Minnick - a former timber company executive and onetime Republican, who'd received endorsements from business groups - is an avowed centrist. The day after he got elected, Minnick pledged to take a bipartisan approach.
\
Meanwhile, journalists around the West reported a surge in gun sales right after Obama got elected. Some Westerners fear that Obama and the Democratic Congress will pass more gun-control laws. They're buying semiautomatic assault rifles, dock pistols and ammo so fast that gun stores are running out and manufacturers are straining to keep up. Apparently, the Old West stereotypes are still alive.

Over the the next two years solar rooftop companies like SolarCity that are hanging their stockings with care, in hopes that hefty government handouts still will be there. After the end of 2016, the guarantee of the Solar Investment Tax Credit will run out and net metering, with its disputed terms, will become more widespread.
\
Net metering proponents hope there won't be any coal in their stockings when it comes to other ratepayers subsidizing their ""free"" solar panels. Of course, the panels aren't really free.
\
The handout in the form of a 30 percent tax credit was originally designed to go to consumers eager to participate in net metering and reduce their energy costs by installing their own solar panels. Instead, the credit increasingly has gone to the leasing companies, the rooftop solar installers, or to tax equity investors.
\
Leasing the panels to affluent customers, companies like SolarCity have securitized their power purchase agreements, raising more than $326 million in asset-backed notes to stay afloat. They've even diversified, getting into the loan business for those customers who still want to own their panels.
\
However, a government report indicates that poorer customers who can't buy the panels outright are often unable to secure the leases.
\
In March 2014 the Congressional Research Service called the tax credit a ""windfall gain"" for those who otherwise would have invested out of concern for the environment. Since the vast majority of installations continue to come through purchase agreements, the jingle you hear is the coin in the rooftop company's coffers.
\
SolarCity admitted as much in 2013. ""Our business currently depends on the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives,"" the company wrote. ""The expiration, elimination or reduction of these rebates, credits and incentives would adversely impact our business.""
\
A quiet proxy battle of sorts has been raging between solar advocates and companies like Xcel Energy, with ratepayers caught in the middle.
\
At issue is the method of calculating the ""value of rooftop solar,"" as the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) chair put it this year. Solar proponents believe the credits for excess electricity generated by solar panels and pushed back onto the grid should continue to get 10.5 cents per kilowatt-hour--the average of annual residential retail rates.
\
Xcel is arguing for a reduction to 4.6 cents, saying the costs associated with maintaining the grid made the reimbursement unfair.
\
Xcel representatives called maintaining the 10.5-cent credit a ""hidden cost"" for its 1.2 million Colorado ratepayers. ""Everybody needs to pay for the cost of the grid,"" said spokesperson Hollie Velazquez Horvath.
\
Rooftop solar uses the grid in multiple ways. For customers pulling energy when the sun isn't out (or near maximum generation) or pushing electricity onto the grid at the peak of summer, the grid balances supply and demand, regulating and stabilizing electrical output. It also acts as the exchange mechanism when a customer goes from generating and reselling excess electricity, to periods when the customer needs more electricity than the solar panel provides.
\
Customers who generate enough ""revenue"" from their net metering credits end up paying little or nothing for the grid costs. The costs get shifted to the utilities' non-solar customers.
\
In other words, solar proponents advocate that non-solar ratepayers continue to subsidize grid maintenance for solar customers and then purchase electricity from those same solar customers at a price higher than they would pay for Xcel to generate the power.
\
Some of the side effects of net metering are already known. Cost shifting disproportionately affects lower-income ratepayers, who can't afford the solar panels anyway. Further, some solar installations don't deliver the promised generation and end up costing the customer double, as they pay for the panels and the grid-based electricity.
\
In 2014, the PUC held three informal meetings on net metering, yet has issued no ruling so far. Legislative action is likely to come in 2015, and possibly a 2016 ballot initiative from rooftop solar proponents.
\
Both Xcel and its opponents see a credit reduction for net metering as a reduction in solar demand. According to the Energy Information Administration, Colorado generated just 0.5 percent of its total electrical output through solar.
\
In the meantime, just like the post-holiday hangover, you get the bill.

"
176,"Near the end of 2005, Louise Helton had one of those life-changing moments that usually only happen in Hollywood movies. Friends had invited her to join Nevada movers and shakers in an ostentatiously decorated Las Vegas casino ballroom to hear former President Bill Clinton speak. He challenged the audience to diversify the state's economy, and to do so in a very specific way. Adopting a Southern drawl, Helton recalls the words that inspired her: ""And he said, 'If I were y'all, y'all would be the Saudi Arabia of solar.' ""\Clinton's pitch made sense to the 51-year-old Helton. With its abundant sunshine, Nevada was well positioned to become a clean energy leader. Besides, the state lacks its own coal or natural gas reserves, so it has to import those conventional fuels, thus benefiting other states' economies instead of its own. ""There is no better or cheaper resource than the sun that is shining down on the sunniest place in the West,"" Helton says.\Clinton's words percolated away inside Helton for a few years. Then, in 2008, she took the leap. Using savings from the two decades she spent working with at-risk kids, she opened her own company, 1 Sun Solar Electric. She kept costs down by melding it with her life partner's successful tile and stone company, and in 2009, they started attaching solar panels to roofs in Las Vegas. Her timing was unfortunate; the recession hit Las Vegas especially hard and the impacts lingered, but Helton was able to keep her small crew working and her business in the black. By the time Nevada's economy bounced back in 2014, the cost of solar panels had plummeted. Helton's company was ready to ride the wave. ""We were making a very good living and supporting a crew of folks who were able to support their families,"" she recalls.\Her business relied on a state law that required the monopoly electricity provider, NV Energy, to pay customers for power generated by their solar panels. For each unit of energy provided to the grid, NV Energy would give them a free unit. This one-to-one swap, called net metering, kept solar customers' bills low and reduced the time it took to recoup their upfront investments.\Big companies that lease solar panels, such as SolarCity and Sunrun, swooped into Nevada, hiring hundreds of people. In 2015, a record 24,564 people applied to be solar customers with NV Energy, according to the company. But near the end of that year, the Public Utility Commission of Nevada, the state's utility regulators, crushed the nascent solar boom by increasing fees for solar customers and slashing reimbursements for the power they feed into the grid. That fundamentally altered the economics of rooftop solar. ""It was stunning,"" Helton recalls. ""That's how we found ourselves upside-down and backwards and almost out of business.""\The Nevada regulators' order was the most extreme example of a nationwide effort by corporate utilities - panicked about losing market share and profits - to roll back net-metering policies. It's backed by the deep pockets of fossil fuel industrialists like the Koch brothers, conservative lobbying groups like ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council, and the electricity industry's own trade group, the Edison Electric Institute. But the Nevada regulators unexpectedly sparked a fierce resistance movement, comprised not only of environmentalists and clean-energy advocates, but also libertarians, small-business owners like Helton, and ordinary citizens who have installed rooftop panels or thought about doing so. It's not just a battle between dirty and clean energy; it involves corporate profits, individual freedom and the appropriate role of government in incentivizing market shifts. And if the ultimate outcome in Nevada is any indication, the utilities have a tough fight ahead of them.\NEVADA'S NET-METERING RULES were first implemented back in 1997, when rooftop solar panels were still a novelty. They required the state's investor-owned utility, NV Energy, to buy the electricity generated by customers' solar panels at the retail rate. Still, the high cost of panels combined with the low cost of electricity in Nevada made rooftop solar economically unattractive, even with net metering, rebates and other incentives. For a decade or more, few rooftops in the state sported panels.\It finally took off around 2013. Prices had fallen enough that most customers could recoup their upfront investments in 10 years or less. And companies had started offering to lease solar panels to homeowners, making solar affordable for people without the $20,000 or so needed to buy their own panels. Like other utilities around the country, NV Energy was supportive of rooftop solar while it was rare. But as soon as its popularity rose, the utility started pushing the Legislature to dial back the incentives.\""Solar growth is happening extremely rapidly across the country, and it's probably going to speed up. That's making utilities very nervous, especially in sunny places,"" says Lincoln Davies, a professor at the University of Utah's Quinney College of Law. ""The change in Nevada was part of a larger trend of utilities starting to push back.""\The terracotta rooftops on Helton's street in southwest Las Vegas tell the story of the boom. Hers used to be the only house with solar panels, but starting a few years ago, several neighbors followed her example. Skip Spreitzer, 66, leased his solar array for 20 years through SolarCity. He wanted to do his part to protect his grandchildren's future by reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that come from burning coal and natural gas. And, as a retiree, he was drawn to the idea that the solar panels would be a hedge against higher utility bills in the future, should natural gas prices spike.\During the daytime, when the sun shines, the photovoltaic panels perched on Spreitzer's roof generate power for his lights and appliances. And when they generate more than he needs, the excess flows onto the grid to be used by nearby homes. Spreitzer relies on the grid at night and during the long hot days of summer, when air-conditioning sucks more juice than his panels can generate.\According to a 2014 study, an NV Energy rooftop solar customer could save on average just over $1,000 per year. For Sp-reitzer, those savings were mostly offset by his monthly solar panel lease payments. But down the street, Helton's bills dropped dramatically after she installed panels in 2010. She owns her own panels, uses LED lighting and efficient appliances and heats with gas. Over the course of the year, her panels produce about the same amount of energy she consumes, so she basically just pays NY Energy service fees. Helton paid $28,000 seven years ago for those panels, about twice today's cost.\These improving economics helped Nevada rooftop solar grow eightfold be-tween 2014 and 2016, following a larger trend. Nationwide, electricity generation by homeowners and small businesses nearly doubled over that time, according to the federal Energy Information Admin-istration, and total solar installations in the U.S. are expected to hit 2 million next year.\Meanwhile, public support for rooftop solar is broadening, even among people who don't plan to use it themselves. ""People like solar. It appeals to everyone from libertarians to the far left. The beauty of solar, particularly rooftop solar, is it doesn't have a single narrative that's driving it,"" says Shelly Welton, an assistant law professor at the University of South Carolina, who tracks renewable energy policies around the country. Some people like it because it saves money, others because it helps fight climate change. Many simply enjoy being self-sufficient.\In part because of the promise of clean energy jobs and the growing political heft of the solar industry, politicians of both parties promote renewable power. In 2013, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, courted clean energy businesses, offering huge financial incentives to lure companies - like SolarCity and Tesla (now one company) - to the state. When a new SolarCity training center opened in West Las Vegas, just a month prior to the PUC's fateful net-metering decision, Sandoval said it would make the state ""the regional hub for training workers in the jobs of the 21st century. Our homegrown solar industry has already created over 6,000 good Nevada jobs, and has tremendous potential to continue driving innovation, economic diversification and opportunity in the Silver State."" SolarCity expected to train 4,000 solar workers a year at the facility.\Meanwhile, utilities and fossil fuel interests like the Koch brothers were already sounding the alarm about the threat rooftop solar poses to their profits. In 2013, electric utilities' main trade group, the Edison Electric Institute, published ""Disruptive Challenges."" The report warns that rooftop solar, batteries and other technologies could ""directly threaten the centralized utility model.""\Utilities sell a product, electricity. If their customers start generating their own electricity, the utilities sell less product and make less money. To keep profit margins up, they have to increase electricity prices - inadvertently chasing even more customers to solar. That creates a feedback loop, or what Edison Electric Institute calls a ""death spiral."" The phrase is ""hyperbolic,"" says Davies, but ""utilities are right to worry about that. The price of solar keeps dropping. Utilities are risk-averse. When they see a risk, they get nervous.""\Publicly, instead of complaining about lower profits, utilities argue that solar power shifts energy costs to the customers without solar, thereby hurting lowincome people. Utilities spread the costs of maintaining the grid across their entire customer base, and with fewer people paying sizeable bills, non-solar customers end up having to pick up more than their share of the grid costs.\Many studies have tried to suss out the costs and benefits of rooftop solar and net metering. Most show that it provides a net benefit, especially if only a small portion of a utility's customers have solar. Collectively, a bunch of residential solar panels functions like a large-scale solar farm, offsetting the need for utilities to construct new power plants or install expensive pollution-control equipment on coal-fired power plants. Utilities also save money they'd otherwise pay for coal or natural gas. And, because the electricity is used by homeowners or their neighbors, rooftop solar eliminates the expensive problem of electricity being lost as it flows long distances on power lines.\Still, utilities, even the ones that support renewables, feel like they're getting a raw deal. They have to pay full retail price for solar generated on homeowners' rooftops, when they could save money for themselves and their non-solar customers by getting power from their own conventional or renewable power plants or buying it wholesale from other providers. Wholesale solar prices have dropped considerably, increasing the gap between what utilities pay for rooftop and wholesale solar. The bigger the spread, the more money they - and therefore their non-solar customers - are losing. Plus, rooftop solar doesn't help electric companies when they need it most. Solar starts to fade during the peak hours of energy demand, in the late afternoon and evening during summer, when people get home and crank up their air conditioners. Companies still have to buy expensive power to meet that demand.\And so, many utilities have gone on the offensive, trying to shrink or kill net-metering policies. In California and Colorado, regulators balked and largely protected solar customers from higher rates. Arizona Public Service, the state's largest utility, spent heavily in the 2014 elections to oust solar-friendly members of the Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities. The Salt River Project - which as a quasi-municipality is not under the jurisdiction of the Arizona Corporation Commission - adopted higher rates for its new solar customers. In Utah, Rocky Mountain Power, which like NV Energy is owned by Berkshire Hathaway, is now trying to boost electricity bills for solar customers.\Since the public backlash was unleashed in Nevada, NV Energy has tried to stay above the fray, at least publicly - the company refused repeated requests for interviews for this story. But one of the strongest voices in opposition to prosolar net-metering policies is longtime labor boss Danny Thompson, who recently retired from the Nevada AFL-CIO and now works as an independent lobbyist for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents hundreds of NV Energy employees. A former state legislator, Thompson says he used to be a big supporter of solar. But he objects to the business model of companies like SolarCity and Sunrun, which lease their panels to customers and finance the installations in part by selling federal tax credits to banks or other investors. It's a good deal for the investors and the middle-class folks who lease the panels. But most low-income Nevadans can't afford to buy or lease solar panels. ""What I didn't like was companies coming in and selling long-term leases so people don't own their solar panels,"" Thompson says. ""The companies were taking the leases and monetizing them on Wall Street as investments. The net effect is you have poor people subsidizing everyone else.""\The union also objected to the fact that solar companies pay less than union wages, and their crews often have only one licensed electrician.\This was the kind of complaint about net metering Nevada lawmakers heard when the Legislature met for its 2015 session. Under Nevada law, the net-metering incentive would tap out once 3 percent of a utility's electricity was produced by rooftop solar. Some solar companies were lobbying hard to increase that cap. NV Energy argued that with solar panel prices plummeting, the industry no longer needed net metering as an incentive.\So in June 2015, Nevada lawmakers ordered the Public Utility Commission to set new rates that would minimize costshifting to non-solar customers.\That summer and fall, the Public Utility Commission held a series of heated hearings in Carson City. Helton attended every session via video link from a commission building in Las Vegas. Pro-solar protesters, including Skip Spreitzer and, at times, hundreds of solar workers, demonstrated outside. It was all for naught. ""We took in boxloads of postcards, and it didn't seem to faze them at all,"" Spreitzer says. ""Those people sitting on the board just weren't going to hear anything we had to say.""\The commission considered the additional costs of serving solar customers but not the benefits -job creation, popularity, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and a cleaner environment. It calculated that on average, the savings realized by each solar customer in southern Nevada would push NV Energy annually to shift $623 to all of the other customers. That increases each non-solar customer's monthly bill by about $2.50, which the commission considered ""unreasonable.""\That the commission then penalized new solar customers was no surprise, but the extent to which net-metering credits were cut, and the fact that they would also apply to existing solar customers, was shocking. ""I was aghast. I thought, there's no way they could do that,"" Helton says.\Even Gov. Sandoval - along with other lawmakers who had directed the regulators to take up the issue - seemed unprepared for the utility commission's order. Sandoval expressed concern about solar workers losing their jobs. But he also told a local television reporter from KTNV that he wasn't picking sides and believed that the Public Utility Commission was ""uniquely qualified"" to make the call.\The consequences were swift and substantial. In 2016, NV Energy received only 287 applications for solar hookups, about 1 percent the number of the previous year. The big leasing companies pulled out of the state entirely. SolarCity's training center shut down, companies closed warehouses and announced layoffs. An estimated 2,600 solar workers eventually lost jobs. Helton herself had to lay off two people, half of her crew. Her neighbor, Spreitzer, watched his electric bills shoot up and knew they would continue to do so. ""I was real worried; I spent a lot of time down there at the Public Utility Commission office where we were having our protests,"" Spreitzer says.\HELTON WAS DETERMINED to ride out what she calls the ""solar coaster,"" and soon became a leader of the movement, in part because she's articulate, outgoing and familiar with the workings of the state Legislature and governor's office after years of lobbying for better laws for at-risk kids. Of the intense political wrangling, she says playfully: ""President Clinton never mentioned that part.""\Thousands of others joined her in protest, prompted by more than just the loss of good jobs. Many people saw the order as infringing on their freedom to choose to produce their own electricity. Activists collected more than 115,000 signatures from voters - twice what they needed - to put a net-metering referendum on the ballot in November. (After a group backed by NV Energy challenged the referendum in court, the Nevada Supreme Court struck it down.)\The intense backlash forced Sandoval off the fence. In the first months of 2016, he made several moves that slowly reversed the commission's order. He named a New Energy Industry Task Force, which included representatives from solar companies and environmental groups as well as NV Energy and Thompson, who represented the employees' union. In May 2016, the group urged the Legislature to restore the original one-to-one reimbursement rates for existing customers. Four months later, it suggested temporarily restoring one-to-one rates for new solar customers, too, while also charging them at least $25 per month to ensure that they pay their share of grid costs. That same month, a Nevada judge ruled that the commission's decision to revoke one-to-one net metering for customers who already had solar was a ""denial of fairness and due process.""\Soon afterwards, the utility commis- sion backtracked, approving an agreement between NV Energy and solar companies to restore net metering to existing solar customers like Helton and Spreitzer. Just days later, Sandoval replaced two members of the Public Utility Commission. In December, the commission temporarily restored net metering for new customers, but only for a limited number in northern Nevada. The commission's new chairman, Joe Reynolds, explained the reversal by quoting Abraham Lincoln: ""Bad promises are better broken than kept.""\Although net metering wasn't on the November ballot, per se, it was prominent in voters' and politicians' minds in the months before the election. Even presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton weighed in. As Justin Watkins went door-to-door in his campaign to represent a middle- and uppermiddle-class Las Vegas district in the state Assembly, he saw how potent the issue was. ""We knocked on 30,000 doors. It was the number-two issue at the door, behind education,"" Watkins recalls. A Democrat, Watkins says restoring rooftop solar is important to both Republicans and Democrats in his district. That may be why he won election in November. As one of his first major actions in office, Watkins sponsored a bill restoring favorable rates for solar customers.\Watkins partnered with Chris Brooks, another freshman assemblyman, who ran for office in part to restore rooftop solar. Brooks has owned and been an executive for companies that installed residential and large-scale solar projects. On the walls of his small office in the Legislature building hang photos of President Barack Obama visiting a couple of Brooks' projects in the Nevada desert.\Soon after taking office, Brooks became a critical player in energy policy, chairing a key subcommittee that drafted much of the energy legislation. He also sponsored a bill requiring NV Energy to get a larger share of its power from renewable sources. He credits the public backlash to the PUC order with motivating legislators to take renewable energy seriously in the 2017 session - the first time lawmakers convened since the 2015 order. ""I think they were mad that government, in their eyes, screwed this up for them and they wanted to fix it. I think it played a tremendous role in empowering us with the knowledge that our constituents really want this and need it,"" Brooks says.\NEVADA'S LEGISLATURE only meets every other year for four months. That meant that the 2017 session was its last chance to pass the rooftop solar bill reversing the PUC's decision, along with a slew of other pro-renewable bills, before 2019. Early on, Helton was delighted to see solar getting so much attention from Watkins, Brooks and others: ""I'm very hopeful that the future is going to bode well for sunshine in Nevada,"" Helton said at the time. But as the weeks ticked down toward the end of the session and the rooftop solar bill hadn't passed yet, the solar advocates got increasingly anxious. ""It has been a constant source of stress and effort. We've lost so much sleep over it,"" Helton says. With only two weeks to go, Vote Solar, an advocacy group, decided it was time to pull out all the stops and gather a group of Nevada solar business representatives to confront the lawmakers face-to-face.\In late May, Helton and her colleagues took a 6 a.m. flight to Reno and piled into cars headed for Carson City. Their mood was upbeat because the day before, the Assembly had passed the rooftop bill, 38 to 2. It was a huge victory, but the ultimate outcome was far from certain. The Senate was still a wild card.\Standing outside the legislative building in the morning sunshine, Helton was the only woman in the group of nine. Wearing a vibrant yellow cardigan over a black polo shirt with her company's logo, she stood out among the sport coats and golf shirts. Jessica Scott from Vote Solar gave the group a pep talk: ""We have overwhelming public support. Nevadans really want to see solar. They were devastated by the 2015 Public Utility Commission decision, and they have in every way possible communicated that they want Nevada to be a clean-energy leader. It's just exciting because it's people power, it really is.""\Fired up, the crew embarked on a journey around the Capitol grounds.\This trip was a matter of survival for the businesses they represented. ""What you see before you are just the remnants that are left of our industry,"" Helton told a state senator during their first meeting that day. ""We've already been struggling for two years to ... keep our companies together, just so we could live to fight another day. Two more years; we just won't make it.""\The big event of the day was the Senate Energy Committee's hearing on the rooftop solar bill. When the group of solar businesspeople filed in, Brooks, the freshman assemblyman, was on the hot seat. Brooks' task was to convince the senators to move quickly to approve the rooftop solar bill. Later in the hearing, the businesspeople each had three minutes to summarize their companies' precarious positions and beg the senators to pass the bill.\Rob Kowalczik, of Robco Electric, had to lay off 27 people after the commission's 2015 decision. ""We lost a million dollars in sales a month. It hurt,"" Kowalczik told me earlier that day. ""I'd really like to bring back my employees.""\Kowalczik was lobbying for the first time in his life. Helton, on the other hand, is an old hand at schmoozing with politicians, and it showed. Throughout the day, she bumped into acquaintances - lobbyists, staffers and legislators - passing out hugs and overflowing with compliments. But the lawmakers were less generous about offering guarantees that the vote would go their way.\When the group encountered Republican Sen. Joe Hardy in the hallway outside his office, he listed the many things he likes about rooftop solar, but warned he couldn't vote in favor of the bill until he had data showing that non-solar customers were not subsidizing solar ones. Sen. Pat Spearman, a retired U.S. Army officer who became an ardent supporter of renewable energy because she believes that too many soldiers have died for oil, predicted that senators voting against the bill would pay for it during the next election cycle. ""It may be difficult,"" she added honestly. ""I will do whatever I can to try to get the bills out that we can if possible. If not this time, certainly next time.""\That was not what Helton wanted to hear at the end of a hard day of lobbying.\Helton felt anxious as they headed back to Las Vegas. Had their message gotten through to enough senators? Would the bill pass? Or would NV Energy find a way to quietly derail it?\ALTHOUGH NV ENERGY'S public position on the bill was neutral, behind the scenes company officials were in frequent contact with Brooks, pushing to reduce the amount that solar customers would be compensated for the power they fed to the grid. ""The bottom line is they just do not support customer generation,"" Brooks said later. But they don't want to broadcast that because ""it's a horribly unpopular position to take, to try to oppose customers having the choice to make their own renewable energy.""\As the Senate crafted its version of the bill, NV Energy proposed cutting the compensation outlined in the Assembly bill. And less than two weeks later, that proposal was included in the bill the Senate unanimously passed. It sets up a sliding scale for reimbursing solar customers. Those who sign up for net metering now get compensated at 95 percent of the retail rate. But if they wait a few years to get in on net metering, they may be compensated at 75 percent of the retail rate.\Even so, the bill, which the governor signed, was a huge victory for solar advocates. It establishes that Nevadans have the right to put solar panels on their roofs, connect to the grid, store power in batteries and not get charged extra fees. ""It's a landmark moment that they included something like that. It recognizes the right to participate in the energy democracy in this way,"" says Davies. ""The Nevada Legislature did exactly what politically responsive bodies are supposed to do; they listened to their electorate.""\Tesla and Sunrun announced they would reopen their businesses. Already Helton is fielding several calls a day from potential new customers. ""Now we hope to have the opportunity to build this industry into the powerhouse it should be for our state,"" she says.\Nevada's solar saga has sent a strong message to utilities in other Western states: Even in the era of Trump, they must accommodate a growing residential solar industry or face the public's ire. Fearing a repeat of Nevada's experience, Arizona's largest utility, APS, reached a settlement with solar companies in March. The rooftop solar companies say it will allow them to avoid what happened in Nevada and keep working in the state. Greg Bernosky, director of state regulation at APS, told High Country News that the utility had been paying very close attention to Nevada: ""We understand solar is a wildly popular resource.""\In Nevada, the public's insistence on solar is ultimately what pushed politicians to bring back net metering, despite the resistance of powerful interest groups. Assemblyman Brooks hopes the public's enthusiasm for rooftop solar will spread to other policies and help accelerate the shift to clean energy in Nevada and potentially across the West. ""As a fourth-generation Nevada native, I see how transformative good energy policy could be in the state,"" he says. ""We can create jobs, clean energy jobs, without polluting the planet and do it with Nevada workers and American ingenuity and American products. That's a win for me at every level."""

Many of the activists who campaigned for municipalization in Boulder envisioned not just a city-run utility that used mostly renewable energy, but one that got its power from the community.
\
They were quietly disappointed when Boulder's analysis of the most cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions leaned heavily on power purchased from wind farms and natural gas plants outside the city.
\
The ""low cost"" option released by the city in 2013 showed Boulder getting 35 percent of its power from wind through power purchase agreements and just 4 percent of its power from local solar.
\
The city currently gets 15 megawatts of power from solar, about 2 percent of the community's requirements. On average, 1 megawatt can power 632 homes, according to Xcel Energy.
\
Now Boulder is taking a close look at just how much power the city could get from the sun, and what a municipal utility could do to reduce barriers and encourage more residents and businesses to install solar panels.
\
Following the recommendations of a working group made up of more than two dozen industry representatives, technical and policy experts, and engaged citizens, city officials are designing a study to determine how much solar can practically be installed in Boulder, and looking for ways to reduce ""soft costs"" associated with permitting and code requirements.
\
""How much solar generation should Boulder target as a goal?"" was one of the questions the working group tried to answer.
\
""The short answer is we don't yet know how much we can deploy,"" the working group says in its report. ""There are two critical questions. First, how much solar can be reasonably installed using available rooftops, parking lots and other unused spaces? Second, is there a reliability threshold for solar penetration on Boulder's electric grid?
\
""While the first question is relatively straightforward, the second is the subject of considerable debate.""
\
'Utility of the future'
\
Utilities and energy researchers around the country are trying to determine what it will mean for infrastructure, rates and resource planning as the percentage of power from local solar -- that's the ""solar penetration"" -- climbs into the double digits and higher.
\
Boulder plans to bring its ""utility of the future"" online in the midst of tremendous changes in the solar industry and the relationship between solar and utilities.
\
Utilities are increasingly investing in large-scale solar farms purely on an economic basis. The projects bring tens and even hundreds of megawatts online at much lower per-watt costs than rooftop solar.
\
The Solar Energy Industry Association found that the average per-watt cost of utility-scale solar projects in 2013 was $1.96, compared to $4.59 for residential rooftop solar.
\
Last year, Xcel Energy requested proposals for power from all sources, and selected two solar projects -- a 120-megawatt project outside Pueblo near the Comanche Generating Station being developed by Community Energy Solar, a company with its Western headquarters in Boulder; and a 50-megawatt project in the San Luis Valley -- because they were more cost effective than natural gas.
\
""What you're seeing is solar projects being selected and added to the system based on economics,"" Xcel CEO David Eves said.
\
Eric Blank, co-partner in Community Energy Solar, said he has rooftop solar himself, and he doesn't expect it to go away.
\
But utility-scale solar projects, with panels mounted on trackers that can follow the sun throughout the day and capture its power well into the late afternoon peak hours, has more potential to reduce dependence on fossil fuels without subsidies, he said.
\
Boulder is not currently looking at large-scale solar for the municipal utility, with planners and activists more focused on the potential of distributed generation -- power from rooftop solar panels being deployed throughout the distribution system -- than on utility-scale projects.
\
The working group identifies commercial rooftops and community solar gardens as areas of untapped potential, where Boulder could achieve economies of scale and bring relatively large amounts of solar online. Solar gardens, which Xcel also offers, also allow people whose rooftops are shaded or who live in apartments to buy into solar power.
\
The report identifies ""assets"" that Boulder has: good sun, an informed and motivated population and a vibrant local solar industry.
\
""Commercial rooftops and solar gardens offer a largely untapped solar resource with economies of scale more favorable than those in the residential sector,"" the report says.
\
Boulder Energy Sustainability Coordinator Yael Gichon said the city may pay a little more per watt for local solar, but there are other economic benefits.
\
""It's good to have diversity,"" she said. ""Large-scale solar is a good thing. But some of the distributed generation, it's not an apples to apples comparison, because you are doing a lot to help the local economy.
\
""We're trying to quantify that.""
\
Debate over net metering
\
Some industry observers are predicting a ""utility death spiral"" as improved storage allows people with rooftop solar to opt out of the grid entirely, leading to higher rates for those who are still connected, and making solar even more attractive.
\
Utility companies are taking a second look at net metering, the practice of paying retail rates to customers for solar power produced on their rooftops and fed back into the grid, allowing many customers to zero out their electric bills.
\
Xcel Energy has asked the Colorado Public Utilities Commission for permission to make changes to the net metering program that would reduce how much the utility pays customers.
\
That request that has sparked opposition from many in the solar industry who fear that lower payments for solar power would make it harder for homeowners and businesses to justify the upfront investment in solar.
\
Eves, Xcel's CEO, said the company's concern is how to account for the overall costs of maintaining the grid, which solar customers still use at night and on cloudy days, even if they zero out their electric bill because Xcel is buying their solar power at retail rates.
\
It's not that much of an issue now -- some 20,000 Xcel customers have rooftop solar, out of 1.4 million -- but it could be one in the future.
\
Eves said Xcel is looking for other ways to account for those costs, such as using savings from lower wind costs to redirect some of the renewable-energy fee that customers pay on their bills.
\
""We think we can solve the net metering problem and create the kind of transparency that is going to have to happen,"" Eves said. ""We can create that transparency while still keeping rooftop solar a viable option""
\
But it's an issue that every utility will have to wrestle with, Eves said.
\
Avoiding an 'undue burden'
\
Obadiah Bartholomy, senior project manager for energy research and development for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, said his utility also has a working group looking closely at the issues that might arise at higher levels of solar penetration.
\
""The primary reason (net metering) may not work very well in the long-term is that the retail rate is made up of a lot of different components, some of which are tied to value of power and some tied to other utility costs, some of which are fixed,"" he said. ""We're not capturing other costs not related to power generation, the cost of our infrastructure, the cost of employee health care, cost of debt service. All our customers who don't have solar have to pay for customers who do. We're really trying to do a better job of aligning those costs.
\
""We don't want to create an undue burden for those who can't do solar.""
\
Advocates for solar say there also are benefits to customers without solar, such as not having to pay for the construction of new power plants.
\
Willie Mein, owner of Custom Solar in Boulder, said he does have reservations about Boulder's ability to effectively manage its own utility.
\
But those reservations are balanced against ""excitement"" that the city-owned utility would have a commitment to net-metering.
\
""The opportunities will be greater with municipalization,"" Mein said. ""Further adoption of renewables is what they had in mind, so I am optimistic that more opportunities will be available than what we will see under Xcel. ...
\
""I believe with the city of Boulder, true net metering will remain intact, whereas Xcel has tried to claw back some of the benefits.""
\
In fact, Boulder's working group failed to reach consensus on whether net-metering was the best way to pay for solar power or whether a monetary incentive would be necessary at all.
\
Calculating 'value of solar'
\
One alternative is a ""value of solar"" calculation that seeks to take in all the costs and benefits to the system. The value of solar varies widely depending on the inputs.
\
Austin Energy, a Texas municipal utility with a strong commitment to renewable energy -- Austin's City Council just adopted a new mandate to replace all the power from a 36-year-old natural gas plant with solar by 2017 -- moved to a ""value of solar"" approach because net metering created equity issues and didn't encourage energy efficiency.
\
Austin has a tiered rate structure where power gets more expensive the more a customer uses. Solar customers who used a lot of power were getting reimbursed at those higher rates because the power was coming off their bill from the top down.
\
But customers with solar panels who didn't use much power were getting reimbursed at lower rates, and customers with very energy efficient homes didn't have much reason to get solar panels.
\
That meant Austin Energy's ratepayers were paying a lot for solar power and creating the wrong incentives for its solar customers.
\
Now the utility does a ""value of solar"" calculation each year based on the value of power from all sources that it doesn't have to buy because of local solar generation, as well as other factors such as transmission costs, avoided environmental compliance issues and base operations and maintenance costs.
\
Customers with solar panels are charged for their consumption, like everyone else, and then get a credit for the value of all the solar they produced.
\
Customers who want a rebate on their solar panels also have to do energy efficiency upgrades, and the utility reassess its rebates every year based on market conditions and to ensure that there is enough money to meet demand.
\
""We don't want to spend public money to get systems that would have gone in anyway,"" said Danielle Murray, solar manager for Austin Energy.
\
Doug Arent, executive director of the Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis, a consortium that includes the Boulder-based National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said the technical solutions are out there for making solar work for utilities and their customers.
\
""The question becomes whether there is a willing and able financial/policy/regulatory environment to use them,"" Arent said. ""And that's also a customer environment.""
\
'There is a lot of hope'
\
Looming over the entire solar industry is the reduction of the federal tax credit from 30 percent to 10 percent in 2017, the same year Boulder hopes to bring its utility online.
\
Some believe there will be just a pause in solar investment, as prices continue to come down, making up for the lost tax credit in a few years. Others think most of the price drop already has been achieved and the impact could be more long-lasting. Or Congress could chose to extend the credit.
\
Boulder believes it already has the right customer environment and that creating a municipal utility will create a financial and policy environment more friendly to innovation.
\
Gichon, Boulder's energy sustainability coordinator, said the working group's report raises important questions for the community about how to integrate solar into a city-owned utility, but it is not a pessimistic forecast.
\
""It's a balance of policy and limitations that we are currently under versus what could or could not be possible in the future,"" she said. ""There is no sense that we would have to limit solar.
\
""I think there is a lot of hope for the possibilities of expanding solar.""

I'd like to second Leslie Glustrom's statement that Xcel needs to do more to fight climate change. Utilities, especially large utilities like Xcel, hold a heavy responsibility: Far more than citizens banding together to turn off our lights, utilities have the ability to make serious progress (or not) on climate change. Xcel, though, is invested in coal through the time when my grandchildren will be well out of college -- 2069 -- which is unacceptable. As Glustrom notes, Xcel will bear the moral responsibility for the consequences of this investment.
\
Unfortunately, moral responsibility rarely holds as much sway as economics for companies. Luckily, though, Xcel can find itself in the black both morally and economically by embracing net metering. Net metering, which allows solar customers to get fair credit for the energy they send back to the grid, is critical to the growth of rooftop solar in Colorado.
\
Xcel is threatening to roll back net metering, despite the fact that net metering delivers over $13.6 million in benefits to all of Xcel's customers every year, according to a recent study by the Vote Solar Initiative.
\
We can't afford to leave any renewable energy options on the table as we fight climate change -- especially not rooftop solar. Xcel should dramatically accelerate its move away from coal, and in the meantime it needs to use its heft to encourage development of all the renewable resources we have, first by protecting net metering. Until they replace their rotten deck, I'd like to see Xcel paint as thick a coat of renewable veneer on there as possible.

Heinz Ebner, in his Aug. 30 letter to the Daily Camera, is absolutely correct when he says the municipalization debate ""...should not be a left-right debate."" Regardless of where you stand politically, you have to believe that the country and the planet cannot go on consuming ever-increasing amounts from a finite pool of fossil fuels -- not to mention the moral problem of imposing external costs like climate change, air toxicity, solid waste, etc., on our fellow citizens and the generations that are coming along behind us.
\
Heck, even folks from the tea party recognize that we are past the inflection point where renewables can be stymied. So I am encouraged by the success of the Green Tea Coalition, an alliance of environmentalists and tea party activists, in Georgia, which ""supports solar power as a way to create greater energy choices for consumers, protect the environment, increase energy security and break the monopoly Georgia Power holds over the state's energy production.""
\
Atlanta tea party leader Debbie Dooley said that they see expansion of solar in Georgia as a free market issue and believe the giant utility monopoly deserves some competition and consumers deserve a choice. Thanks in part to this group's pressure, the Georgia Public Service Commission voted 4-1 in July 2013 to require Georgia Power to add 525 megawatts (!) of solar energy by 2016.
\
Meanwhile, here at home, we see Xcel dialing back their solar incentive program and threatening to make net-metering less attractive to prospective buyers of residential solar systems. Right or left, you cannot deny that the status quo is not working. This is why I'm voting ""no"" on the Xcel-backed ballot Initiative 310. Don't let this utility monopoly block consumers from being energy independent.

Colorado's potential to capture the sun's energy is almost as vast and equally as promising as the resource itself. I'll just come out and say it -- the future looks bright for solar energy in Colorado. But all puns aside (for now), solar power is clean, affordable, virtually limitless, and has a remarkable level of bipartisan support among Coloradans. The revelation that a whopping 79 percent of Americans support the increased development of solar energy is enough to make headlines in our increasingly divided political climate.
\
That explains why special interests' attempts to block the policies that have helped spur the nation's solar boom have worked to bend the truth and -- let's face it, what better place for a healthy dose of puns than a creative piece about energy issues facing our state -- operate in the shadows.
\
In all seriousness though, a new Environment Colorado Research & Policy Center report shows that's just what the Koch brothers have done. ""Blocking the Sun,"" written along with the Frontier Group, details how they, along with the American Legislative Exchange Council, and 10 other special interests, are running some of the most aggressive campaigns against solar energy in country, often behind the scenes or through front groups that offer the ruse of citizen support.
\
This national network of utility interest groups and fossil fuel industry-funded think tanks provides funding, model legislation and political cover for anti-solar campaigns. Then, in state after state, electric utilities use the support provided by these national anti-solar interests, supplemented by their own ample resources, to attack key solar energy policies.
\
Since 2010, America's solar energy capacity has grown more than four-fold, generating increasing amounts of clean energy at increasingly affordable prices. Tradition is at stake here; our society has a longstanding tradition of reliance on the combustion of fossil fuels to power our lives. Also under threat if this renewable energy trend continues uninterrupted? Respiratory illness from air pollution, sea level rise, and climate change, to name a few. Oh, and the business model of fossil fuel interests and utilities that have a not-so-well-hidden monopoly on our energy policies.
\
These fossil fuel interests and utilities are working in at least 21 states and have earned some success for their efforts. Kansas made its renewable electricity requirement voluntary earlier this year, and Ohio suspended its own similar law. West Virginia effectively capped the number of homes and businesses that could go solar with restrictions on net metering.
\
And in Colorado, we've certainly had setbacks. Recent data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows that Colorado could generate 360 times the electricity we currently use, just from the sun. With an estimated 500,000 roofs that could host solar panels, we could meet 20 percent of our electricity needs just with rooftop solar. But solar power decreased drastically in Colorado between 2013 and 2014, knocking Colorado from seventh place to 10th place in the United States for total annual solar power capacity per capita.
\
I don't think I'm alone in feeling that something is going wrong when Colorado is getting significantly less energy annually from the sun than Massachusetts is. We have enough sunshine in Colorado to meet our electricity needs, but we are lacking the good policies to keep us among the leading states for total solar energy capacity per capita.

While the intent may have been satire, the story missed the mark when it misrepresented Colorado Springs Utilities' position on renewable energy.\Since we introduced hydroelectricity into our system in 1905, we've long supported the use of renewables to reduce the demand of fossil fuels for production and produce cleaner energy. We've demonstrated that commitment through our participation in state and federal legislation.\When other Colorado utilities were voting to opt out of Amendment 37 renewable portfolio requirements, we voluntary self-certified and worked to have larger hydroelectric grandfathered into the standard. We supported House Bill 1281, which increased the renewable portfolio standard limits for investor-owned utilities and required greater participation by municipal utilities.\Solar energy is a viable generation option being used by more and more of our customers. We helped draft and supported House Bill 1160 in order to establish net metering standards for our state and help our customers. Along those same lines, two of our efficiency rebates reward customers for using solar technology to generate electricity and heat water for their homes.\In addition to our role at the legislative level, we're taking positive strides in terms of managing our impact on the environment. We're currently reviewing proposals to add a significant amount of windgenerated power to our energy supply. In 2008, we become a founding member of The Climate Registry, a national agency that measures and publicly reports greenhouse gas emissions in a common, accurate and transparent manner.\The reality is that coal will play a major part of our energy mix for some time to come: it's reliable, there's an abundant amount of it in our country and it allows us to keep rates low, something of great importance to our customers. To minimize our impact on the environment, we use low-sulfur coal and are currently testing technology that may allow us to remove a majority of contaminants during the burning process.\Moving forward, we'll continue to identify and implement energy options in a manner that's responsible and responsive to our community.

Just 12 states have 85 percent of the installed solar electricity capacity in the country. Those states, including Colorado, have just 28 percent of the population.
\
The Environment Colorado Research & Policy Center issued a report on Tuesday that ranked Colorado 8th in the nation for solar installations.
\
The top 12, according to the report, are Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina and Vermont. Most have abundant sunshine, but they also benefit from an array of policies that allow consumers and companies go solar. America has more than three times the solar capacity today as in 2010, and more than 10 times as much as in 2007. In the first three months of 2013, solar power accounted for nearly half of the new electricity generating capacity in the United States.
\
But it's not clear sailing. Consider Arizona: The state ranked at the top of Tuesday's report, which cited that almost all the states on the list have strong net metering policies. That allows customers to sell their excess power to the grid. Currently, the Arizona Public Service Corp. is asking state regulators to level hefty fees onto customers for selling their excess power to the grid.
\
Barry Goldwater Jr., the son of one of the most famous American conservatives, is making the conservative case against those fees now. ""Choice means competition. Competition drives prices down and the quality up,"" Goldwater was quoted by Mother Jones. ""The utilities are monopolies. They're not used to competition. That's what rooftop solar represents to them.""
\
It's not surprising that there is industry turmoil. Coal, petroleum and natural gas are still the dominant, most powerful players here. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory reviewed U.S. energy use in 2012: Petroleum accounted for 34.7 percent of our energy use, with most of that being consumed by transportation. Coal was 17.4 percent, mostly used for electricity generation. Nuclear and natural gas made up the bulk of the rest of that generation.
\
Hydro was just 2.69 percent of our energy use; wind, 1.36 percent; solar, 0.235 percent. Interestingly, while much of the conversation and incentives are driven by consumer wants -- residents who want solar panels on their homes, commercial businesses that want to use or sell renewable energy -- we shouldn't forget that the biggest energy gobblers are the electricity generators, our vehicles, and industrial production. And, as the national lab reports, a good deal of the energy is just wasted, mostly in the form of heat.
\
So despite rapid growth in renewable energy sectors, the opportunities are much, much bigger. We should be focusing on reducing waste, using more renewable energy in electricity generation and, especially, transportation.
\
But in the meantime, consumers and residents are clearly drawn to solar energy, and want to support the growing industry. Policies to purposefully hamper that growth to benefit the coal and oil companies should be DOA.

185,"\Five governors have called for their states to move toward 100% renewables. Among them is Colorado's recently elected Governor, Jared Polis. \Electricity from renewable power sources has doubled in Colorado since 2010, and now makes up 1/5 of Colorado's electrical mix-- but coal and natural gas still comprise 79% of generation. This heavy fossil fuel dependence is a burden on our state's well-being, and threatens our ski economy.  How we move away from fossil fuels to a renewables based system is a key public policy issues.\In Colorado, 13 communities rely on the Municipal Energy Agency of Nebraska (“MEAN”) to responsibly keep their lights on. These municipalities include: Gunnison, Glenwood Springs, Delta, Lyons, Aspen, Fleming, Fort Morgan, Haxtun, Holyoke, Julesburg, Oak Creek, Wray and the City of Yuma, CO. The focus of the study is how to promote greater reliance on renewables for the communities in the MEAN system.\For most of us, flicking a light switch is done without a lot of forethought. But perhaps if we knew more about the environmental price at which our electricity is produced, we would think twice.  MEAN projects are increasing the percentage of our energy mix that comes from coal generation through 2030.\A Gunnison based research organization, Sustainable Development Strategies Group (SDSG), has identified growing concern in MEAN's service communities about this reliance on coal. This spurred a study of MEAN's system in Colorado, and whether their policies encourage or inhibit renewable energy generation at the local level. SDSG's study is now public and can be found at www.sdsg.org/mean-study. \SDSG has determined a combination of factors in the MEAN system which have created a difficult environment for renewable energy to obtain traction at the local level.  All municipalities should review their options for adopting energy policies that will encourage rather than restrain local adoption of renewables by individuals. \The following are a sample of salient recommendations from the study: \•  The study recommends that MEAN move away from its policy currently limiting municipal generation to a maximum of 2% of their energy requirement. This size limit is too restrictive and rules out many economically scaled projects.\•  We observe that the way net metering is administered in different towns may be a major factor in the differences in solar adoption. Glenwood Springs' approach, of giving the customer the option of rolling over balances until the customer account is closed, is no doubt the most favorable. The approach in Fort Morgan and Gunnison of a monthly reconciliation is clearly the least favorable, and strongly resisted by potential solar customers. We would recommend that Gunnison and Fort Morgan model the results, using actual usage of current customers, to see the difference and how it might affect both them and solar customers. \Colorado's governor is making the transition to renewable energy a principal policy goal of the state. For those living in rural communities, we must be conscious of the ways in which these regions are often leapfrogged during technological evolution. The current plans for MEAN's energy future are not consistent with the expressed desires of MEAN's own members, or the political climate in Colorado. Continuing down the current path will lead to increasing conflict in the system.\Report Available Now\The report can be found at www.sdsg.org/mean-study. We are also happy to send copies of our report to anyone who might have interest. If you know anyone who we should send a report to, let us know.

In his March 16 Camera column, ""Renewables? Yes!"" Bob Greenlee praised the recently announced plan by Xcel Energy to construct a large utility-scale solar PV project in Pueblo County which he claims will be ""two to three times more cost-effective than smaller rooftop projects."" Although a dubious claim, such a project might still seem like a good idea -- to those unaware of the incredibly rapid changes taking place in the energy world. But the ground is moving under Greenlee's (and Xcel's) feet. Over the last year, and particularly in the last few months, the main debate has shifted from fossil vs. renewables to centralized renewables vs. distributed renewables -- specifically rooftop solar PV.
\
Just over one year ago, the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), the investor-owned utility policy and lobbying organization, issued a brief, but prescient report titled ""Disruptive Challenges: Financial Implications and Strategic Responses to a Changing Retail Electric Business."" The report offered its members a ""heads-up"" that their basic 100-year old business model was threatened by rooftop solar, and it recommended that they rethink their whole business. The costs of rooftop solar panels (called Distributed Generation or DG) have dropped so dramatically that in some places they are already cost competitive with utility-supplied electricity. The conventional economies of scale of centralized generation is simply gone -- solar modules are just as efficient at small scale as large. Public pressure has been mounting for PUCs to adopt new tariffs that recognize the ""Value of Solar"" to society and to encourage its use by moving beyond the ancient ""cost-of-service"" regulatory model that does not recognize the externalized costs of traditional generation (e.g., to air, water, health, jobs, environment, etc.) or the benefits of DG.
\
Late in 2013 utilities in California, Arizona, Colorado, and other states began asking their regulators to slash the net metering tariffs that have encouraged the growth of rooftop solar, and to impose onerous fees for solar customers connecting to the grid. In November, the public pushed back in Arizona and won a victory with regulators, in spite of millions spent by utilities on lobbying. In another landmark decision last week the Minnesota PUC actually adopted the nation's first ""Value of Solar"" tariff.
\
The EEI study warned that a consequence of resisting the trend to solar DG would be that those who could afford to would go off-grid by adding storage to their solar, and then strand the utility as conventional costs were shared by fewer and fewer rate-payers -- resulting in a utility ""death spiral."" Two weeks ago, the Rocky Mountain Institute issued a 70-page cost study that validated the EEI warning, ""The Economics of Grid Defection: When and Where Distributed Solar Generation Plus Storage Competes With Traditional Generation.""
\
The following general guiding principles ought to be applied in evaluating the present and any future electricity generation projects: 1) produce power as close as possible to where it will be used, and local utilities should 2) only manage the ""wires and poles,"" and 3) let the customers generate the power wherever possible.
\
Some may ask, why not build large-scale renewable projects that could be located on spoiled, unproductive, or ecologically unimportant brown fields near existing transmission facilities? The answer is that society's preference should be to favor smaller-scale distributed renewables located at or near the point-of-use, and on fostering the markets for such technologies and products. Every dollar sucked up by a large utility-scale project is a dollar that cannot be invested in rooftop solar, smart inverters, battery storage, small scale hydro, smart appliances, and other mass market technologies that result in long-term community-based jobs and manufacturing. The big projects tend to be one-time deals that primarily feed short-term construction jobs for outsiders, as well as provide rewards for bondholders, investors, land speculators, and utility's rate-base return-on-capital assets. Transmission losses can waste 8-14 percent or more of the power. If Xcel builds their farm, what they will actually do with the power? Will they will then retire the Comanche (or any) coal plant?
\
For a glimpse of how consumers might see solar in the future in America, look at the present in Germany (http://bosch-solar-storage.com/). Xcel's 900-acre solar farm may be obsolete long before it is off the drawing board.

In the spring of 2003, Dan Fink got a hamster named Skippy to power a nightlight. It took some imagination. First, Skippy had to be no ordinary hamster, but one of the Syrian variety, a breed that runs particularly fast and goes all night. Next, for all his relative speed, it turned out Skippy could only chug along at 60 revolutions per minute, too slow to charge a battery or generate a volt, so Fink had to build him an alternator out of extremely strong magnets. And then there was Skippy's noisy exercise wheel, which was not only obnoxious, but a waste of energy. Fink solved that by retrofitting it with a smooth ball-bearing.
\
Finally, after Fink glued 14 magnets to a steel ring and fashioned two coils out of 30-gauge wire, he mounted the whole contraption on Skippy's cage. He then hooked up two LED lights to the alternator. Together, they shone bright enough for Fink to find the bathroom in the dead of night. And even though the little rodent was voltage-deficient, ""he had torque to spare,"" Fink says, so he added another light, and another, the resistance increasing with each new load. He got up to six lights before Skippy showed any fatigue.
\
Fink, with his friend Dan Bartmann, co-owns the company Forcefield, and lives off the grid in the mountains above Fort Collins, Colo. If you have space for a 30-foot tower, the Forcefield guys will help you build a backyard wind turbine and hook up to your local utility. They talk about the physics of electricity the way other people talk about their favorite bands.
\
""Did you know you can see electrical charges?"" Fink says. ""That's why metals look shiny. You're seeing electrons absorbing photons and emitting them back at you.""
\
Fink acknowledges that hamster power is a bit silly; ""I only did it because kids wrote in to ask us,"" he says. But the experiment demonstrates a prin- ciple that science-minded eighth-graders understand better than many adults: One way of generating electricity is to spin a wheel of magnets around metal, or a metal wheel around a magnet. And there are many different ways to get that wheel to spin. Wind will do it, and so will a waterfall. Steam will, too, whether raised by burning coal, splitting atoms or with the concentrated energy of the sun. The principle remains the same: Me- chanical energy creates electrical energy when electron-conducting metal travels through a magnetic field.
\
Fink, who considers education to be Forcefield's primary business, believes our widespread ignorance about the workings of watts and volts has gotten us into trouble. ""People call us all the time and say, Tm worried about climate change! I want to put solar panels on my roof,'"" Fink says. ""But then we find out their houses aren't insulated, and they're using incandescent light bulbs during the day. We make them do all the cheaper things before we teach them how to make their own power.""
\
When people do make their own power - on their rooftops, or with a 30-kilowatt microturbine installed in the basement they pay more attention to how they use it. They replace kitchen lights with compact fluorescents and reading lights with LEDs. They might even turn the lights off altogether for a few hours.
\
Electricity generated Forcefield's way - close to home and in small batches is called distributed generation. It's the way Thomas Edison originally delivered electricity back in 1882, when he built the United States' first power plant in Manhattan and provided energy to just 60 customers. In the last decade or so, ever since California became the first state to open its energy markets to individual competitors, distributed generation has been sputtering back into the U.S. energy mix, making a dent in energy demand and securing supplies where blackouts mean disaster. It allows an ordinary electricity consumer to become a oneperson power plant, and guarantees that a business can weather a downed power line without incident.
\
Local power plants are not always easier on the planet than the ginormous remote kind, but at least their pollution is immediate and visible, which makes it easier to clean up before it goes global. ""Small-scale operations, no matter how numerous,"" wrote E.F. Schumacher in his 1973 book, Small is Beautiful, ""are always less likely to be harmful to the natural environment than large-scale ones, as their individual force is small in relation to the recuperative forces of nature.""
\
And local, small power plants operate close to the buildings where people live and work, so they sacrifice less energy to transmission. Their waste heat can be used to warm rooms and water, in a process called combined heat-and-power (CHP), which doubles a generator's efficiency. In some cases, that waste heat can turn another fluid into gas to spin another turbine and make yet more electricity.
\
So why aren't we turning en masse to local generation to offset coal-fired power and reduce carbon dioxide emissions? The short answer is that, ever since 1895, when Nikola Tesi a and George Westinghouse lit up Buffalo, N.Y., with an alternating current generated 90 miles away at Niagara Falls, the developed world has acted as if all our power plants were waterfalls located far from the cities that need light. The longer answer requires taking a close look at energy policy in the United States: Who makes money on it and how it moves forward.
\
A revised blueprint that can accommodate smaller, scattered systems would have to be more complicated and would strain and confuse the transmission system that evolved over the last century. That system was set up for the utilities that once owned and controlled every part of the electricity business, from generators to distribution lines to transmission corridors - utilities that, for more than a century, found that the bigger the plant, the more efficient it was, and the cheaper the power that came from it. Whether overhauling the system is worth it depends on a lot of factors, one of them being money. And, perhaps, how desperate we are for solutions.
\
IF YOU READ HIGH COUNTRY NEWS, you probably know the statistics: Global greenhouse gas emissions have increased 70 percent since 1970, and our energysquandering ways are to blame. Coal-fired power accounts for nearly a third of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.; natural gas power another 10 percent. If our emissions continue to climb, the oceans will rise and submerge island nations, species will go extinct, and millions of acres of fertile soil will turn to punishing dust.
\
We may be able to avert the worst of these consequences, say a team of scientists in the journal Nature, if we cut our carbon emissions to half of what they were in 1990. In the U.S. alone, that means reducing carbon by 3.5 billion metric tons, the equivalent of retiring all of our coal-fired and natural gas power plants.
\
In many environmental circles, these facts have been used to support a simple argument: Anything done to displace coal-fired power is good. We need big solutions and massive investments in energy projects, centralized and large like the old ones, only cleaner. Small solutions will take too long.
\
And maybe that's true. A 2007 Department of Energy report estimates that 12 million independently owned small onsite generators, or ""DG units,"" currently operate in the U.S., with a combined capacity of only 2,000 megawatts. Roughly half of those megawatts are from solar photovoltaic cells, which produce electricity by absorbing the sun's photons and liberating electrons. In a country with a little more than 1 million megawatts of generating capacity - slightly more than 90 percent of it fossil-fueled or nuclear - those numbers seem hardly worth discussing.
\
But even that report, which Congress ordered the Energy Department to complete in accordance with the 2005 energy bill, finds few reasons not to scale down more of our power and move it closer to home. The authors argue that the days of ""economies of scale,"" as they apply to electrical power generation, are over: The improved technology and efficiency of small-scale systems means that it no longer costs less per kilowatt to build giant plants.
\
That's not to say that we don't need large-scale renewable energy to help replace fossil fuels. Electricity generated at big wind farms costs 5 cents per kilowatt-hour, well below the national retail electricity average of 10 cents; with production tax credits, the price drops to 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, which is hard to beat. Photovoltaic solar still costs 30 cents per kilowatt-hour compared to 15 cents per kilowatt-hour for largescale concentrating solar power (CSP), which uses sun-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's energy, and can be scaled up to hundreds of megawatts.
\
Nor does it mean that distributed energy alone can solve all, or even most, of our energy problems. The precise benefits of millions of small generators infiltrating the U.S. power supply are difficult to predict, even for the Energy Department. (Doing so would require ""a complete dataset of the operational characteristics for a specific site,"" and success would be ""highly improbable."") But to trivialize distributed generation's potential is to assume that our problems stem only from the fuel we use to make electricity, not from the model we use for generating it.
\
There are many indications that large solutions will take longer than small ones. Even leaving aside the land-use issues and lengthy permitting processes that may bog down large-scale renewable projects for years, the Midwestern Independent System Operator estimates that just to bring wind energy from the Great Plains to cities will require building $80 billion worth of transmission lines, amounting to more than half the circumference of the earth. We're also in a deep recession.
\
""When the capital market returns, the small, fast, modular projects will recover much faster than the big, slow, lumpy ones,"" says Rocky Mountain Institute founder Amory Lovins, who has been advocating for distributed generation for 30 years. ""Central power plants with capital costs in the billions can't get financing at all."" Collectively, the benefits of distributed energy - Lovins counts 207 of them - ""increase the value of smaller systems by a factor of 10. That's enough to flip any investment decision.""
\
As with Dan Fink's experiment with Skippy and the wheel, the transition to small and local after a century of large and distant may take some imagination. ""What you're really talking about,"" Lovins says, ""is the flowering of a million miniature solutions.""
\
THERE'S ANOTHER LESSON to be learned from Skippy, who in his living hamsterness reminds us once again that not all fuels are fossil. And just as there are many ways to spin a turbine, there are lots of ways to make fuel. You can even extract it from your garbage.
\
Ten years ago, Steve and David Gill weren't thinking about energy solutions. They were looking for something to do with the 200,000 to 300,000 pounds a day of waste they had leftover from peeling and chopping onions for salsa companies and supermarkets. They originally tried using it for compost on the 15,000 acres of onion fields they tend in Oxnard, Calif., but as their business grew, it became, Steve Gill says, ""a huge, stinking mess.""
\
The Gills had been hit hard by the California energy crisis in the summer of 2000, when the manipulation of the state's electricity market caused blackouts across the state. It made Steve Gill think: What if onion waste could somehow be turned into energy?
\
Gill called his friend, Bill Deaton, a chemical engineer and energy consultant from Kayenta, Utah. Deaton had an idea for seeding the Gills' onion waste with tiny bugs that would digest the waste and turn it into methane. ""Digester gas,"" as it's called, has already been made from beer waste to run boilers at breweries; dairy farmers from Maryland to California feed digesters with manure and make a profit on the fuel. New York City makes 4.7 billion cubic feet of methane from its wastewater sludge. No one, however, had yet made methane from onions.
\
Deaton consulted the California Biomass Collective at the University of California at Davis, which determined that the sugar in onions makes them particularly nutritious food for microbes. He got a Dutch company, Biothane, to build a specialized digester. ""It's heaven for microbes in the digester,"" Deaton says. ""We give them the right temperature, the right pH, and make the food available. They eat all this stuff, and they develop gas. That's methane."" Deaton and Gill elected to use the digester gas in a fuel cell.
\
A fuel cell makes electricity through chemistry. It works like a battery that never needs recharging, as long as you keep feeding it hydrogen. Fuel Cell Technology Inc. of Danbury, Conn., manufactures a fuel cell that converts methane to hydrogen internally, mixing hydrogen electrons with oxygen electrons to make electricity, heat and water. It's quiet, emits nothing and with combined heat-and-power, it runs at 90 percent efficiency.
\
Fuel cells have limitations. They need pristine methane to run properly; the sulfur that stings your eyes when you chop an onion will poison a delicate fuel cell. The California Energy Commission awarded a $106,000 grant to an Illinois company, Gas Technology Institute, to figure out how to take the sulfur out of the onions. The solution will extend to other agricultural wastes in the future.
\
The system will take a few months to ramp up, says Deaton. The microbes, which came from Anheuser Busch they're ""beer bugs,"" Deaton says - have to adapt, eat and digest before sufficient gas can be harvested. For now, the Gills' two 300-kilowatt fuel cells operate on natural gas, connected up to Southern California Edison's grid. They inoculated the digester on June 8, and expect to have onion fuel by fall.
\
The state and federal governments have been supportive: California's Public Utilities Commission ponied up $2.8 million from its Self-Generation Incentive Program, and the Gills will get another $1.8 million from the federal government, money that would have trickled in as an investment tax credit before February's stimulus bill turned it into a grant. The entire project, including all the research, cost $9 million, but the Gills will save hundreds of thousands of dollars every year on waste disposal. With the incentives, he expects it to pay for itself within five years. And he can be confident about the math: Although natural gas prices fluctuate wildly several times a year, the price of onion gas is always the same.
\
Steve Gill acknowledges that his transition to local power was far from simple. Negotiations with Southern California Edison were ""time-consuming,"" he says. (Utilities typically extract a number of significant fees for the transition to local power.) He might have given up were he not intent on ""getting rid of a huge problem,"" he admits. And ""now we've turned the whole thing into a demonstration project.""
\
The University of California at Santa Barbara has adopted Gills Onions as a teaching model for other agricultural operations, and now Steve Gill goes around, he says, ""helping other guys do this thing. Because really, you shouldn't have any waste out of a food plant. There's a use for everything.""
\
E.F. SCHUMACHER WROTE Small is Beautiful 36 years ago, when political shifts in the Middle East suddenly awakened the world to the reality that its petroleum might not last forever. In the years that followed, we were supposed to start driving smaller cars, wearing cardigans in the house, plastering our rooftops with solar panels. Congress passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) in 1978, requiring utilities to buy electricity from independent renewable generators at competitive rates. Millions of solar roofs were set to bloom.
\
But it didn't happen. Instead, cars got big again and the sweaters came off, along with the solar panels on Reagan's White House roof. And large, centralized fossil-fuel plants solidified their hegemony: Between 1980 and 1999 in the United States, 155 new coal plants came online. Photovoltaics and wind could not begin to compete with the price of electricity generated from coal. Consequently, PURPA did little to promote any kind of renewable energy except combined heat-and-power.
\
Coal's steady pulse of cheap electrons seduced us into doubting whether efficiency itself was worth the trouble. While a few states have followed California's lead in ""decoupling"" utility profits from electricity sales, for most of our electrical history, utilities made a profit per kilowatt-hour. Along with those profits came a parade of gadgets to encourage profligacy: electric can-openers and toothbrushes, garage-door lifters, dishwashers and air conditioners, all of them creating a need where there once wasn't even a desire. GE, as its slogan went, brought good things to life.
\
In an essay published in the 1983 book Nuclear Power: Both Sides, Amory Lovins described how French energy-efficiency planners in the 1970s figured out that most of their electricity went into heating buildings. Because France fueled almost all of its generators with oil, and oil supplies were suddenly in peril, efficiency experts started looking to other sources - waste heat from on-site generators, passive solar, natural gas to warm the country's buildings.
\
At the same time, however, the country's energy supply planners, ""who were far more numerous and influential in the French government,"" discovered nuclear power. By the mid-1980s, the country had more than 50 reactors, generating so much electricity that heating buildings with it didn't seem so wasteful anymore. In fact, ""the only way they would be able to sell all that electricity would be for electrical heating.""
\
Lovins' point was this: If you start at the consumer end, you can calculate how much energy we need to live and build what you need to supply it. If you start at the supply end, you predict future demand by adding numbers to the current demand. And you can only satisfy that demand with ever-larger supplies of power.
\
If it's hard to separate reliable electricity from behemoth generators, it's harder still to think of getting by without coal, oil or natural gas. As former Energy Secretary James Schlesinger and Energy Department veteran Robert L. Hirsch wrote in a recent editorial for the Washington Post, ""Solar and wind electricity systems must be backed up 100 percent by other forms of generation to ensure against blackouts. And in today's world, that backup power can only come from fossil fuels.""
\
They're partly right: In general, wind farms and solar plants generate power at the mercy of nature. But as onion fuel demonstrates, backup power can come from multiple sources. It can even come from the sun.
\
About 2,500 miles across the Pacific, Darren Kimura has a cough. ""It's the V og',"" he says on the phone, a condition that occurs when ash from Hawaii's Kilauea volcano mixes with moisture-laden southern breezes. ""I'm allergic to it.""
\
Still, he soldiers on to explain the mechanics of the organic Rankine cycle, the process his company, Sopogy, uses in its compact concentrating solar thermal power generators to make and store electricity.
\
""In the 'organic' Rankine cycle, you use organic fluids,"" he explains, such as liquid propane, which changes based on the temperature. As with large-scale concentrating solar thermal plants, suntracking mirrors in Sopogy's technology focus sunlight on a container of fluid. As the fluid flashes to gas, it spins a turbine. While batteries store electrons, a Sopogy collector simply stores heat, ""like a thermos,"" says Kimura, so the miniature solar collector can extend the solar day and generate power through the vog. ""Storing thermal energy is cheap, and the system lasts for 30 years.""
\
A typical Sopogy unit weighs 150 pounds, measures about 12 feet by 5 feet and puts out 250 kilowatts at 392 degrees Fahrenheit. The unit doesn't even need flat land: Sopogy has tucked a 1-megawatt system into four lava-encrusted acres at the Natural Energy Laboratory on the Big Island. Kimura tells only potential clients the full price of the system, but he promises that a Sopogy collector can generate electricity at 20 cents per kilowatt-hour, 10 cents less than photovoltaic solar. As with photovoltaics, that cost will drop as manufacturing scales up.
\
Kimura is a slightly built 34-year-old, who looks even younger in person. But he's studied energy ever since his parents helped build Hawaii's space observatories, putting their son to work wiring the utility substations that powered the telescopes. At an early age, he realized that his state had energy problems: ""We can't build more power plants, but we've had a soaring demand for power,"" he says. ""I had an incentive early on to care about efficiency."" Later, he worked on a voltage-regulation device that would even out loads from distributed generators across small local grids. In Portland, Ore., in the 1990s, he helped the federal government develop efficiency standards for EnergyStar appliances.
\
Nine years ago, Kimura came back to Hawaii, to apply his expertise to the state's peculiar energy problems. Hawaii has long been nearly 100 percent dependent on oil, but Gov. Linda Lingle, R, has set an ambitious goal of securing 70 percent of the state's energy from renewables by 2030. ""We have a very limited amount of land and unique conditions,"" Kimura says. ""We need to use our local resources. We needed to do something conventional and simple, something a plumber could understand, because you can't fly a consultant in from California every time you have a problem."" Because a Sopogy system is ""just metal and a steam turbine,"" Kimura says, it's possible to ""manufacture them in an automotive parts factory with the same equipment, the same press, the same laborer who once made the car frame window.""
\
The Hawaiian government has given Kimura $10 million to fund more research, and the vice president of the state's major utility, the Hawaiian Electric Co., has been an enthusiastic backer. With recent publicity about large concentrating solar plants in California's Mojave Desert, requests for quotes from Sopogy have gone from one a month to 15 a week. Kimura has tested the system in Abu Dhabi, in Washington state and in Spain. This summer, the company will install 50 megawatts of solar power spread over several small installations in Toledo, Spain.
\
Kimura's system is not the only way to get small-scale non-photovoltaic electricity from the sun. An Arizona company called Stirling Energy Systems has built six 25-megawatt solar generators using engine technology originally invented by Robert Stirling, a Scottish minister, in 1816. Mirrored dishes focus the sun's heat on hydrogen gas, which turns small electric generators as it expands and contracts. The gas never escapes or runs out; it's not being burned so much as put to work.
\
But Stirling is thinking big: The company has contracts with both Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric to supply 1,600 megawatts of power in installations of 300 megawatts or more by 2012, backed by $100 million invested by an Irish developer in April 2008. But that sum represents less than a 20th of the system's estimated cost, and the technology has yet to be demonstrated on such a large scale. In poor developing countries, though, with few capital reserves, small concentrating solar generators have already been deployed by the Solar Turbine Group of Cambridge, Mass. The nonprofit has installed two such systems, one and three kilowatts each, to provide electricity and hot water to rural villages in the Southern African country of Lesotho. More will follow.
\
A FEWYEARS into deregulation in California, when people were getting stranded in elevators and produce rotted in coolers during blackouts, distributed energy seemed once again to be the wave of the future. The push toward small and local began when the state partially deregulated the electricity markets in 1996; it continued on through 2000, when the Public Utilities Commission established uniform statewide standards for distributed systems to connect up to the grid.
\
Yet for all the technologies that have sprung up around that effort, from microturbines to photovoltaics poured into shingles, California's major investorowned utilities have not exactly encouraged their customers to invest in their own small generators. Indeed, as former state Energy Commissioner John Geesman put it two years ago, ""There's an ongoing schizophrenia in state energy policy between what we say we want to do and what we actually allow to happen."" Eloquent state reports hail the advantages of distributed energy, but the state regulates utility profits in such a way that customer-owned generation shrinks utilities' earnings. The current rules make a $700 million steam-generator replacement at a nuclear power plant, or a $2 billion transmission line, appear to be sound investments, because the utility can bill customers for their cost and upkeep.
\
""Large utility- own ed power plants, transmission and distribution lines, electric and gas meters all contribute to the revenue stream (of investor-owned utilities),"" says Bill Powers, an electrical engineer and energy consultant in San Diego, Calif. The more a utility owns, the more it earns."" The profit is not trivial: The California Energy Circuit reports that Pacific Gas & Electric chief executive Peter Darbee earned $8.7 million last year, 5 percent more than the year before, despite a reported $79 billion in average annual losses due to blackouts.
\
Most of Powers' research, which can be found in a document called San Diego Smart Energy 2020, has been focused on obviating the need for the Sunrise Powerlink, a 500-kilovolt transmission corridor slated to cut through pristine areas of San Diego County to bring solar and geothermal energy from remote locales to the city. San Diego Gas & Electric, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy, has promised its investors that the utility will earn a $1.3 billion profit on the $1.9 billion line. ""When I looked at the numbers,"" Powers says, ""I thought, 'I may even consider building a transmission line myself.'""
\
Damon Franz, a regulatory analyst with the California Public Utilities Commission, agrees that none of the investorowned utilities that dominate the state have a direct monetary incentive to encourage distributed generation. But he notes that some utilities pursue some distributed energy anyway, simply because it's good public relations. Southern California Edison has conducted workshops to support customers wanting to take advantage of the California Solar Initiative, a program that pays cash incentives for photovoltaic systems. PG&E helps people connect new systems to the grid in record time. ""The people that work within that program get 90 percent of their applications processed within a month,"" Franz says. He attributes such responsiveness to a service territory full of ""eco-minded and progressive"" customers.
\
PG&E has also been worried about losing those eco-minded and progressive customers. In 2007, just as a coalition of San Francisco environmentalists and consumer groups, including the local Sierra Club and the Democratic Party, unveiled plans to break free of the utility, PG&E launched a $10 million marketing effort called ""Let's Green This City."" The San Francisco County Board of Supervisors responded by approving the activists' plan, allowing the city to take advantage of a 2002 law that permits cities and groups of cities to shop among independent producers for power. ""Clean Power San Francisco"" has now set a goal of securing 51 percent of its power from renewable sources, including digester gas-powered fuel cells and microturbines, by 2017. ""Distributed generation is a core part of the city's goals,"" says Michael Campbell, the program's director.
\
Other communities in other utilities' territories may follow San Francisco's example. In April, Southern California Edison angered residents of Palm Desert, Calif., when it lobbied against legislation meant to subsidize rooftop solar. The bill would have required utilities to establish a ""feed-in tariff to compensate owners of photovoltaic installations per kilowatt-hour at a premium rate.
\
The state assemblyman who authored the bill, Brian Nestande, withdrew it shortly after Southern California Edison executive Catherine Hackney sent a letter to legislators asking them to vote against the bill. The state already allows customers with small renewable systems to choose between selling as much electricity back to the utility as they use (known as ""net metering"") or selling all the electricity they generate - including any surplus - for a modest feed-in tariff. As the tariff on average pays less than California's 12-cent-per-kilowatt-hour retail electricity rate, it benefits almost no one.
\
Assemblyman Jar ed Huffman of Marin County received similar input on a bill to allow small wind and solar producers to sell surplus power back to the grid, a measure he believes would encourage more consumers who install their own systems to conserve electricity. Huffman's legislative analyst, Lawrence Cooper, compares the current system to filling your car's tank but having to turn in your surplus gas should you not burn through it after a certain period of time. ""These people paid to put their systems on their homes,"" he says, ""they're providing power for the grid. They should get paid for them.""
\
Huffman says the bill actually benefits the utilities because they get credit toward their renewable energy requirements, which in California will rise from 20 percent in 2010 to 33 percent in 2020. Still, Pacific Gas & Electric has not dropped its opposition, even though the bill has been re-written and re-introduced, and no longer allows homeowners to intentionally install more power than they need.
\
TWO DECADES AFTER THE FRENCH WENT NUCLEAR, Amory Lovins and a group of co-authors published the book Small is Profitable: The Hidden Economic Benefits of Making Electrical Resources the Right Size. In it, they argued that the free market has already begun to favor distributed energy over centralized energy, as deregulation and restructuring ""exposed the previously sheltered power-plant builders to brutal market discipline,"" and shifted the economics toward local power. ""Central thermal power plants stopped getting more efficient in the 1960s, bigger in the '70s, cheaper in the '80s and bought in the '90s,"" they write. ""At the same time, new kinds of 'micropower' generators thousands or tens of thousands of times smaller - microturbines, solar cells, fuel cells, wind turbines - started to become serious competitors.""
\
Speaking by cell phone as he waits for a plane in Denver, airport alert bells and PA system announcements blaring behind him, Lovins has some advice for beleaguered utilities. ""If you're AT&T and somebody invents this new thing called a 'cell phone,' do you hunker down and just hope cell phones go away, or do you get into the wireless business?
\
""Utilities should be treating distributed generation as a source of profit and competitive advantage rather than as a competitive threat,"" Lovins says. ""It's hard to get their heads around a lot of little things instead of a few big things, which is what they're really good at. But if they want to provide low-cost reliable power for the least amount of risk, distributed generation can do it for them. The barriers to smaller systems are really cultural, not technical and economic.""
\
There are some signs that utilities, investor- owned and municipal, understand what it means to adapt, even if they haven't embraced the change. Lovins notes that Idaho Power, an investor-owned utility in a state with no renewable energy goals, used to install, lease and maintain photovoltaic systems for its off-grid rural customers. The utility ended that program in 1997, a move its renewable energy specialist, Scott Gates, still laments. ""I liked it,"" he says. ""It provided a real service, (and) it made financial sense, because we didn't have to construct distribution lines at $20,000 a mile."" The program no longer fit with the utility's post-deregulation business model, so it left the market to other solar providers. But Gates still writes checks at the end of the year to people who generate surplus power on their rooftops.
\
Southern California Edison is negotiating with state regulators to install 250 megawatts of distributed solar on rooftops leased from ratepayers, adding to nearly 450 megawatts of currently interconnected photovoltaics. Sempra Energy is using nine of Sopogy's solar collectors to air condition a 45,000 square-foot office building in Downey, Calif. And while San Diego Gas & Electric's plans for 52 megawatts of tracking photovoltaic panels were recently thwarted by regulators who deemed them overpriced (at $7 per watt), the utility has been busily installing ""smart"" meters in its customers' homes and offices. The meters are one step toward a grid with advanced two-way communications to help utilities manage intermittent renewable power. It may also help integrate those plug-in hybrid cars that the new chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Jon Wellinghoff, envisions shoring up the grid over the next decade.
\
ON A NOVEMBER DAY in 2007, Con Edison severed the last wire from the only remaining power plant Thomas Edison had established in New York City. Edison built the city's electrical framework based on a low-voltage direct current that could barely make it across the street, but many of the city's old buildings had remained wired for it. The shuttering of the old power plant at 10 East 40th Street meant the utility had finally finished converting the city to alternating current. It was, reported the New York Times, ""a final, vestigial triumph by Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse.""
\
Then again, maybe not. For even as the city threw over Edison's current, its energy planners have begun installing micro turbine s in office towers, fueling them with digester gas and recycling waste heat to warm the city's buildings - in other words, steadily returning to the inventor's distribution model, the one that required a power plant every mile or so. Had we followed that model all along, we might not now be wrangling with an invisible legacy of heat-trapping pollution.
\
Edison wasn't right about everything. He spent decades battling Tesla's technology, to no great purpose - these days, even the hamsters generate an alternating current. But the debate over local versus long-distance power may have finally tilted in his favor.
"
188," Alternative energy advocates are masters of painting pretty mental pictures, of an America liberated from its dependence on ""dirty"" fossil-fuels and powered by ""clean"" alternatives: wind turbines, solar panels, hamster wheels or whatever the panacea of the moment is. And those pretty pictures obviously have curb appeal. Colorado voters in 2004 imposed statewide renewable energy production quotas on most utilities, based on promises (already proven false) that such mandates would be virtually cost- and consequence-free. A number of other states have joined the fad.\ California's Public Utilities Commission last week approved $3 billion in subsidies for the California Solar Initiative. And many members of Congress -- including Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar -- have been completely swept away by the craze for so-called ""renewables,"" and want to pour even more of the taxpayers' money into increasing their miniscule contribution to the nation's energy portfolio.\ But a new report to the California Energy Commission may provide a sobering reality check for these folks. The study, conducted in part by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, found that ""between 20 and 30 percent of renewable energy projects that sign contracts with electric utilities are likely to never reach operation or otherwise fail to meet expected performance metrics,"" according to a report posted on Greenwire, an environmental news site. And reliance on certain solar power projects could result in a ""50 percent or higher failure rate,"" according to researchers.\ This news isn't likely to be received well in states that are sipping the renewable-energy-Kool-Aid -- or gulping it, in California's case. ""As California considers adopting the nation's strongest mandates for renewable portfolio standards (RPS), the likelihood of substantial project failures poses a threat to reaching those goals, the report says. California law requires utilities and other load serving entities to meet a 20 percent RPS goal by 2010, but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) and the California Public Utilities Commission want to accelerate the RPS to 33 percent by 2020,"" reports Greenwire.\ The study didn't look at project failures just in California, however, but in other states and in foreign countries, suggesting across-the-board problems delivering on the pretty picture's promises. We know, we know: solar and wind power are still ""emerging"" technologies. But solar has been an ""emerging technology"" for three decades at least and still can't stand on its own without a government crutch. And the only reason wind power has become cost competitive with coal or natural gas is because it is subsidized and the cost of fossil fuels has gone through the roof.\ ""Causes of contract failure outlined in the report include: failure to site or obtain permitting for the project; interconnection problems; financial failure by the developer; lackworthiness by the utility buyer; increased development costs; project delay because of unstable political environment, with regard to federal production tax credit subsidies; and technology issues,"" according to Greenwire. ""Wind power projects, for instance, face delays from a growing domestic shortage of turbines, while biomass plants often have difficulty securing costeffective fuel supplies.""\ A wind power project in the Midwest lost one nervous financial backer, for instance, when controversy arose because bats were being killed by turbine blades.\ Say what one will about old-fashioned coal-fired power plants, or their gas-fired counterparts, but they are 100 percent proven technologies that deliver electricity not just when the wind blows, or when the sun shines, but on demand -- which is what Americans expect when they flick on the light switch. And the same can't be said for many pie-in-the-sky alternatives.\ Crystal Wosik for Congress\ Even if she doesn't win tonight's Miss America Pageant, Miss Nevada 2005, Crystal Wosik, in our view deserves to wear the crown of Most Courageous Contestant. She told pageant judges that she supports completion of the nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nev. -- an idea not universally applauded in Las Vegas, where this year's pageant takes place.\ Sin City is about 90 miles from the proposed repository. Most Nevada state officials have been pulling out all the stops to kill the plan. But according to a report in The Las Vegas Review Journal, when Wosik was asked during the interview portion of the event what she thought of Yucca Mountain, she ""told them that (nuclear waste) has to go someplace, and that (Yucca Mountain) was the best-built facility in the country.""\ And when the judges asked whether she worried that people ""might die"" as a result -- an outrageous question that proves the judges are dumber than the contestants -- Wosik responded: ""We just have to take one for the team.""\ We're sure this had some Nevadans wanting to ""crown"" Wosik, though not with a tiara. As home to a nuclear test site, Nevada has been ""taking one for the team"" since the advent of the atomic age, which helps explain the regional resistance to Yucca Mountain. But whether or not one backs the project, one has to applaud any Miss America contestant who would dare to take a position so sensible, but so at odds with the prevailing political climate in her home state.\ And no one has to ""die"" or ""take one for the home team"" as long as the nation continues to handle nuclear materials safely and responsibly -- which is what Yucca Mountain is designed to do.\ This episode shows that Miss America contestants aren't just beautiful and brainy, but also can be brave and independent-minded enough to speak an unpopular truth.\ The heck with Miss America. We need Crystal ""Clear"" Wosik in Congress."
189," Thank goodness for Andy McElhany. The Colorado Springs Republican and Senate minority leader may not be able to stop the renewable energy juggernaut rolling through the Legislature, but at least he and a few colleagues, including Rep. Amy Stephens from Monument, are asking the hard questions that every utility customer should want answered before the state imposes new renewable energy mandates.\ We frequently hear about all the supposed benefits of doubling the Amendment 37 mandates approved by voters in 2004, but we hear next to nothing about the potential costs to utility customers, who have no basis on which to calculate the trade-offs. Environment Colorado last week rolled out a report purportedly showing that imposing a 20 percent renewable energy mandate by 2020 will be a boon to Colorado's economy. But it's a predictably lopsided analysis from a left-wing advocacy group that doesn't take into account the drain on utility customers' pocketbooks the political manipulation of energy markets might cause.\ Backers of the mandates were quick to jump on this piece of sophistry as the final word on the subject.""We've only just begun to tap the potential of a new energy economy,"" gushed Gov. Bill Ritter. ""Continued investment in clean energy helps our state ensure economic prosperity."" But we'd like a more balanced and objective view.\ Before Colorado sails farther into these uncharted regulatory waters, aren't ratepayers owed something more substantive, in terms of analyzing the potential impacts, than skewed ""studies"" and baseless assertions? We think they are. And so, apparently, do a few brave Statehouse skeptics.\ ""There's been no cost-benefit analysis done,"" McElhany said Thursday. ""I hate to see the state rush headlong into this much of a financial commitment, particularly for our citizens who will ultimately have to pay the cost in the form of higher electric bills."" The mandates ""won't come without some costs as well,"" added Stephens. ""I'm a move forward kind of person, but I say move forward cautiously.""\ A key backer of the mandates, Boulder-area Rep. Jack Pommer, said the issue has been studied sufficiently. ""Saying there's been no cost benefit analyses is just plain wrong,"" Pommer said. ""There have been and that's why companies are moving in this direction.""\ But Pommer is wrong. There are few, if any, unbiased studies of the ratepayer impacts of such renewable energy mandates, in Colorado or in any other state. And the fact that investors are bullish on renewables and biofuels isn't surprising, given that their returns are almost guaranteed, and risks minimized, thanks to mandates of the sort being contemplated in Colorado.\ The issue isn't whether such mandates are good for rentseeking companies and investors, but whether they are in the ratepayers' best interest, since they ultimately will pay the price for these regulatory follies. And the fact is, the cost impacts of such mandates haven't been much studied by objective third parties. A review of renewable portfolio standard (RPS) impact studies by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory shows that the vast majority were conducted by advocacy groups or interested parties. Only two of the 28 studies received were done by state agencies or academic institutions; the rest were authored by consultants or advocacy groups whose objectivity is suspect. Six were done by the far-left Union of Concerned Scientists, for instance.\ ""It is noteworthy that many of the reviewed studies have been produced by organizations and authors that are strongly supportive of RPS policies,"" the report says, ""whereas few of the studies have been funded or conducted by RPS opponents."" That such studies predict minor ratepayer impacts, or even economic benefits, would be expected. But they hardly serve as a basis for crafting sound energy policy.\ It's unlikely at this point that much can be done to stop the new mandates. Too many politicians have too much invested in this command-and-control approach to back off now. And the new mandates were approved by the House on Friday. But it's good to see McElhany, Stephens and a few others asking the right questions and getting mandate backers on the record, so ratepayers will know whom to hold responsible when the law of unintended consequences kicks in.\ An open-and-shut case\ After initially signaling an unwillingness to budge on the question of opening more of the south slope of Pikes Peak to the public, Colorado Springs Utilities surprised many on Thursday by agreeing to do so. We think the compromise hammered out between recreationists and the city-owned utility sounds promising, as long as the spirit of give-and-take continues when the devilish details are being hashed out.\ ""We heard you,"" Scott Campbell, director of operations for CSU's water system, said Thursday, when unveiling a multiuse plan that will open closed areas and allow the completion of the 70-mile Ring the Peak trail.\ CSU has strong arguments in favor of limiting access, including the huge problems a human-caused wildfire in the area or pollution of the reservoirs could cause. And there are additional costs involved in managing the area for recreation, not just as a pristine watershed, that will have to be shouldered by somebody. But these are public lands. And while that designation doesn't give citizens license to abuse or over-use them to the point it would jeopardize the city's water supply, we believe the vast majority of people will treat the land respectfully.\ Kudos to CSU and the various stakeholder groups and activists that helped forge a compromise. There are great opportunities, but also some risks, in this experiment. And if the opportunity is muffed, we'll be on the slippery slope to closure again."
190,"The Kansas City Star, Sept. 14\Keep renewable energy mandate and benefits of wind power:\Despite Gov. Sam Brownback's sudden lack of support for it, the renewable energy mandate in Kansas deserves to be kept in place.\The Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requires the state to get at least 20 percent of its electric power from sources such as the sun and wind by 2020. It has created thousands of jobs in the wind industry, provided new income to farmers and kept electricity prices in check for utility customers since bipartisan approval by the Kansas Legislature in 2009.\Unfortunately, its few enemies are rich and influential in the strong-arm kind of way when it comes to lavishing campaign contributions on lawmakers.\Opponents include special interest groups that financially benefit from the dominance of coal and other polluting fossil fuels (hello, Koch Industries) as well as conservative lobbying groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, Americans for Prosperity (a Koch-funded group) and the Kansas Chamber of Commerce.\The newest threat to the clean-energy RPS comes from someone with plenty of political clout.\In recent weeks, Brownback has indicated he has thrown in his lot with enemies of the rules, and will work to repeal them if he's re-elected this fall.\The fact that Brownback would take this position on an issue that has benefited so many Kansans undermines his credibility as someone looking out for consumers, not special interests.\Democrat Paul Davis, Brownback's opponent, has the right answer. ""I will veto a bill that repeals our RPS,"" he said during his State Fair debate with the governor in Hutchinson last weekend.\At the time, Brownback ducked the issue, saying, ""Let's see if a bill gets to my desk.""\That's not leadership. In fact, just days earlier, Brownback had conceded he was open to the idea of the repeal, talking about how interested parties could come together to hasten the demise of the RPS.\But why would the wind industry, in particular, want to do that? Remember, this is a state law that is working exactly as intended.\It has brought jobs to Kansas, something Brownback and other GOP lawmakers purport to be interested in.\It has helped farmers who receive lease payments when wind turbines are placed on their properties, part of the reason several rural GOP lawmakers defend the RPS.\And the rules have not led to an explosion in electricity rates, despite reckless statements to the contrary by some state lawmakers.\Instead, as the Kansas Corporation Commission has found, the cost of the renewable mandate actually accounted for only about 2 percent of the cost of electricity in the state.\Want to see a true driving force behind higher utility expenses? Consider the hundreds of millions of dollars spent to install modern equipment at coal-fired power plants to slash the harmful pollution they belch into the air.\Repeated attempts in the Legislature to repeal the standard have not succeeded. Most recently that was because of some brave opposition by Republican lawmakers in the 2014 session. For that stance, at least six House members were targeted for defeat in August primaries. All won.\Brownback should retreat from his current stance and go back to playing a more familiar and positive role for Kansans, the one where he's been a champion of wind power, especially in a state known as the Saudi Arabia of wind.\The energy standard needs to be retained, and even strengthened with requirements for using more renewable power in the future.\_\The Salina Journal, Sept. 10\Harry Reid Harry Reid Harry Reid:\One of Kansas U.S. Senate candidate Greg Orman's chief campaign points is that Washington has become more about partisan politics and not at all about solving the nation's problems.\So it was more than odd -- embarrassing, actually -- when Sen. Pat Roberts, the man Orman hopes to defeat in November's election, went way out of his way during their debate at the Kansas State Fair to validate Orman's point.\No matter the topic or question, Roberts repeated his mantra ad nauseam: Harry Reid, Harry Reid, Harry Reid -- with an ample supply of ""Obamas"" and ""Hillary Clintons"" thrown in. That and accusing Orman, an independent, of being a liberal, were about all Roberts had to offer.\It got so bad that whenever Roberts was asked a question, some in the crowd started mocking the senator by yelling the name of Reid, D-Utah, the Senate Majority leader.\Roberts has been in Washington as long as Orman has been alive. He has to be more knowledgeable than Orman, and he could have used that superior knowledge to his advantage to appear more statesmanlike, above the fray and in charge. Instead, he went for the low blow and ended up hurting himself.\Harry, Hillary and Obama are the red meat of the hardcore conservatives, whom Roberts already has locked up. What he needs is the people who are more likely to vote for Orman, independents and moderate Republicans.\But instead of courting those voters, he went out of his way to offend them. His tactic showed a lack of respect for Kansas voters, as if we can be persuaded with just a few code words. Give us more credit than that.\There are important issues in this campaign, and some of those were mentioned Saturday, including water, immigration, military cuts and the solvency of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\But no matter what the topic, Roberts insisted on invoking the name of Harry Reid and accusing Orman of being a liberal. It not only wasn't necessary, it should have been beneath Roberts.\The benefit for voters is that Roberts exposed an ugly, shallow side of himself they weren't used to seeing. That will give them something else to consider in the voting booth.\It also proves Orman's point about what's wrong with Washington.\_\The Hutchinson News, Sept. 12\Train tracks:\A $12.4 million federal grant will shore up ailing train tracks in Kansas that carry Amtrak's passenger train, the Southwest Chief.\The tracks actually are owed by Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which hauls freight, but used by Amtrak for its passenger service from Chicago to Los Angeles. The $12.4 million strictly is for track repairs in Kansas. BNSF agreed to maintain the tracks once the repairs are made.\The grant is the first step that potentially will save the Southwest Chief, whose future has been cloudy for two years. Additional money is needed to repair some of the tracks between Chicago and LA.\But for now, the grant extends Amtrak's commitment to Kansas -- all of Kansas. The passenger line had threatened to detour the route to Oklahoma once it hit Newton because of the deteriorating tracks from Hutch through Garden City. Though the tracks are good enough for slower moving BNSF freight, Amtrak service was slowed by the worn-out tracks.\So the multimillion-dollar grant is good news all around. It keeps the Amtrak route for now and ensures passenger service in Kansas.\Other monies are involved in track repairs, including state and local funds. But a key component in the federal grant application centered on BNSF's commitment to maintain the route once track repairs are made.\There was praise aplenty being tossed around this week for communities and elected officials who've dedicated themselves to this project. But the overriding fact remains that rail travel in Kansas is as important as air travel and has been for decades.\Parents easily can board an Amtrak train with their children and spend the day in Dodge City or Garden City or Hutch. It gives the child a different view of travel and allows them to explore the amenities of Kansas towns, such as Boot Hill in Dodge and the gigantic swimming pool and unbelievable zoo in Garden.\Those might not seem important to Amtrak officials but the ease of boarding a train without hassle opposed to body scans and searches at airports is like night and day. Trains are comfortable and offer their own set of amenities. Admittedly, though, trains are for those who have the luxury of time.\Kansans who long have depended on passenger trains can be grateful for the $12.4 million grant, which extends rail service. That's worth hopping the nearest train and celebrating in the dining car.\_\The Topeka Capital-Journal, Sept. 15\Statehouse grounds a beautiful scene:\As Topekans and visitors to our city go out and about to enjoy the seasonal beauty that fall brings with it, there is one spot they should make an effort to see.\The Statehouse grounds, after years as a construction site, have become an especially pleasing sight, and the advent of fall and cooler weather offer the perfect opportunity to take it all in at a leisurely pace.\Granted, there still are a few visible scars from the years of hosting construction material and equipment -- tracks through the grass are noticeable at one point and there are a few bald patches -- but the overall appearance is one of beauty. The people who care for the Capitol lawn and its environment have done an outstanding job deserve credit for their efforts.\The spruced-up entrances to the grounds, courtesy of the recently completed construction project, (given the duration of the Statehouse restoration, we think it's still fair to use ""recently completed"") set the tone for what Topekans will find as they stroll across the grounds.\Flowers and other plantings are abundant and colorful, the trees offer shade and benches provide places to rest and take in the scenery. The green grass in all directions offers the perfect setting for everything that meets the eye. Even the grandeur of the building in the center of the property appears enhanced by the beauty just outside its many doors.\This page has been used on multiple occasions to encourage Topekans and other Kansans to visit the restored Capitol and see what they purchased with the $300 million they are paying for the project. We continue to think a trip to the building is a good investment of time, but also encourage those who visit before winter has its way with the landscape to spend some time walking the grounds and enjoying the scenery to be found there.\To be sure, there are other public places across Topeka and Shawnee County that in the fall show off spectacular and colorful scenery. Lake Shawnee and Gage Park quickly come to mind, and anyone walking along some of the trails in the city or just outside of it will come across a lot of seasonal sights.\Just remember to include the Statehouse grounds on the itinerary this year."

192,"
My great privilege in early December was to fly from my home in Colorado to join American business leaders at the U.N. climate talks in Paris.
\
While in Paris, we witnessed how leadership from the U.S. business community -- on display for all the world to see -- positively influenced negotiators and helped solidify the historic agreement.
\
We heard how corporations like Google and Apple are rapidly transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy. And we spoke with start-up companies whose entrepreneurial spirit embodies the kind of optimism needed to effectively address climate change, the central environmental challenge of our time.
\
But now that the agreement has been signed and reducing carbon has become a global objective, it is unfortunate some backward-thinking members of Congress are threatening to block the agreement.
\
As a Coloradan, a small business entrepreneur, and a clean energy advocate, I know that letting Congress tamper with the Paris agreement would be bad news for businesses across our state. Congress should support a breakthrough international agreement that holds so much potential for so many American businesses, including companies located right here in Colorado.
\
The fact is that thanks to smart Colorado policies, our state has emerged as one of the global leaders in clean energy. This means many of our businesses are in a prime position to tap into the growing international market for American-made clean energy goods and services.
\
When I told our Parisian hosts and attendees from other nations about the actions at the state and local level that Colorado's citizens, businesses, and officials are already taking to address climate change -- and how it's benefited our economy -- I was not prepared for the surprised reactions. They had only heard about our recalcitrant U.S. Congress -- and nothing about the significant work being done on the ""subnational"" level.
\
For instance, I told them how, right here in Colorado, our clean energy industry has been growing thanks to more than a decade's worth of common-sense, state-level policies like our Renewable Portfolio Standard. Enacted under a Republican governor in 2004, our RPS has attracted billions in clean energy investments.
\
The wind industry alone has attracted nearly $5 billion in investment capital to our state, while Colorado's solar industry has since 2007 added $1.42 billion to Colorado's economy. All this capital means jobs. According to the national nonpartisan business group Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2), Colorado ranked third in the nation in the number of clean energy jobs announced during the third quarter of 2015. This marked the fifth consecutive quarter Colorado ranked in the top 10 in E2's closely-watched national clean energy jobs report.
\
Beyond smart state policies, I told my Parisian hosts about the federal Clean Power Plan. Finalized a few months before the Paris talks, the Clean Power Plan sets the first-ever national limits on carbon pollution from power plants. Our nation's biggest breakthrough yet on climate change, it provides a road map for American industry to stabilize the price and secure the supply of energy sources. As each state, including Colorado, implements its own plan to meet the standards, we send a strong, clear market signal to the private sector that will help expand Colorado's already strong clean economy; attract new investments that stimulate innovation; and help improve our environment.
\
I also told my Parisian hosts how Denver has joined the pioneering City Energy Project, which can help cut carbon by encouraging buildings to benchmark energy use and then providing tenants the resources they need to improve the efficiency of buildings.
\
I went to Paris in part to share the good news about Colorado growing its economy while also being a responsible citizen of the world. Now that I'm home, I hope our leaders -- in our towns and cities, in our statehouse, and in our nation's capital -- will stand with the business community in support of the Paris agreement and smart policies like the Clean Power Plan.
\
