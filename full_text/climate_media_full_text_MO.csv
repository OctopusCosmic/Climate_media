0,"News-Leader\Jefferson City -- The hot- button issue of Missouri's law mandating ethanol be blended into gasoline re-emerged in a Senate agriculture committee hearing Wednesday.\Sen. Matt Bartle, R-Lee's Summit, presented his case for repealing the 13-month-old 10 percent ethanol standard before a Senate panel of mostly farmers, a few of whom have a financial interest in the biofuels industry.\By mandating ethanol be blended into gasoline when the corn-based alcohol is cheaper than regular gasoline, Bartle said the state has created a system of winners and losers, disrupting the free market system.\""We're coming along and saying 'government knows better,'"" Bartle said in a nearly 20-minute monologue that delved deeply into conservative economic philosophy. ""We are picking ethanol over other alternative (energy) technologies ... that might produce less dependence on foreign oil.""\Missouri's alternative energy standard went into effect Jan. 1, 2008. Until November of last year, most gasoline sold at stations in the state contained 10 percent ethanol, as mandated by the new law.\But when gasoline and oil prices plummeted this fall, the ethanol mandate was voided by a price- trigger requirement designed to ensure customers are only forced to buy ethanol-blended gasoline when it's less expensive.\Before the mandate, Bartle said, 70 percent of Missouri's gas stations and convenience stores sold gasoline with 10 percent ethanol, also known as E10, which most internal combustion vehicles can handle.\""I didn't need government to tell me that I had to buy one fuel or another,"" Bartle said.\And with ethanol producers already receiving a 51-cent per gallon federal subsidy, Bartle said the mandate ensures ethanol is profitable when the price of gas is high. He equated it to a ""welfare"" system for corn farmers.\Bartle said the ethanol mandate has more to do with corn farmers having a powerful lobby in Jefferson City than sound public policy.\""The reason we do it is because we all like corn farmers,"" Bartle told the panel, which includes three corn farmers.\Bartle also said livestock farmers have been adversely affected by the rising demand for field corn at ethanol plants, which extract the alcohol to make the fuel.\Despite Bartle's pleas for the committee to renew their faith in capitalism and vote out a repeal of the mandate, he wasn't getting much sympathy.\""None of us here are going to change our minds,"" said Sen. Frank Barnitz, a livestock farmer and Democrat from Lake Spring.\Chaired by Republican Sen. Dan Clemens, a Webster County farmer, the agriculture committee includes of some of the Senate's most ardent supporters of biofuels.\Sen. Wes Shoemyer, a Democrat and farmer in northeast Missouri, is an ethanol and biodiesel investor. Sen. Bill Stouffer, R-Napton, is a Saline County farmer and also has invested in a biodiesel plant.\Both Shoemyer and Stouffer have received state tax credits for their investments in agribusinesses while serving in the legislature, The Associated Press reported last year.\Shoemyer said the emergence of biofuels and the profits that have followed has made farming a financial reality for his children.\""I really believe that this made a difference for my kid to come back home,"" Shoemyer told Bartle.\Prior to Bartle's hearing, Stouffer presented a bill that would extend the mandate to diesel fuel, requiring all diesel is blended with 5 percent biodiesel, which typically comes from soybean oil.\Stouffer defended Bartle's claim that the ethanol mandate has diverted field corn from its traditional use for feeding livestock to ethanol plants, thus driving up the price of food in the grocery store.\Stouffer noted that since field corn, gasoline and ethanol prices dropped a few months ago, the price of food has remained the same.\""If ethanol was what pushed the price of food up, why haven't they gone down?"" Stouffer asked.\Stouffer said there's a ""social value"" for Missouri by depending on less foreign oil.\Bartle later told Stouffer: ""It's always tempting to force our people to buy things that they would not otherwise buy."""
1,"Congress has the opportunity to promote cleaner, affordable, homegrown American energy that will result in lower carbon emissions. Unfortunately, many remain preoccupied with energy tax-raising and job-killing cap-and-trade bills to address climate change. Until we can come together to push solutions where we agree, both the American people and the environment will suffer.\Many are calling on the U.S. to cap its carbon emissions. I support cutting carbon emissions; I just want to do it without killing jobs and raising energy costs. The Congressional Budget Office, Washington's official money scorekeeper, says that cap-and-trade climate change legislation would hurt the economy and cost U.S. jobs (). Even CBO is probably underestimating the costs because CBO looked at only the cheapest first 10 years of the 40-year legislation. In later years, the legislation and its costs become even greater.\Many Americans might not know much about CBO, but they do know about job losses, high energy bills, the pain at the pump and the troubles of providing for a family during these tough economic times. Missouri families and workers are struggling to make ends meet and fighting to keep their jobs. They cannot understand why we will make their lives more expensive with higher energy costs and policies that would send their manufacturing jobs to countries that produce energy at a cheaper cost, such as China. They also do not understand why we might sign an international treaty letting China and India off the hook of emissions cuts, especially when scientists tell us that the U.S. acting alone would have no impact on world temperatures.\More than 30,000 Missourians recently sent cards to my office decrying cap-and-trade legislation that would raise their retail electricity rates up to 26 percent by 2012, 42 percent by 2020, and as much as 77 percent under worst case scenarios (). The University of Missouri's Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute found that cap-and-trade would raise production costs at a representative Missouri grain farm by $11,650 in 2020 and $30,150 in 2050 (). These are costs my Missouri constituents do not want to pay, especially when U.S. unemployment tops 10 percent. Yet, that is exactly the environmental policy of cap-and-trade advocates: Make energy more expensive so people use less of it.\I think there is a better way than inflicting pain on the American people. I say cut carbon emissions without raising energy prices and killing jobs with zero-carbon nuclear energy, low-carbon biofuels, low-carbon technology to clean coal emissions, low-carbon hybrid and plug-in vehicle technology, energy efficiency and conservation where it makes economic sense, and opening U.S. reserves of clean natural gas. These are carbon-cutting strategies where we can come together, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to do so as soon as possible.\Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., is a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee."
2,"Here's the Modern Whig Party view on cap and trade.\Why take those energy sources we currently use, heavily tax them and by doing so, raise our monthly cost to fuel our cars, heat and air condition our homes? You're right, it doesn't make sense and yet we have a bill in Congress that currently will do so. As we know, it is called the cap and trade bill. (H.R.2454)\Yes, we need to move to alternative energy sources as our current domestic sources are estimated to only last 150 years as we understand it at this time. So the alternative energy sources of solar, wind, biofuels and nuclear energy are the way to go in the future. However, for the most part, except for biofuel and nuclear energy, they are not totally viable at this time due to limitations in design and efficiency. Yet, though challenged, we can get these alternative energy sources up and running within 50 years and move slowly from the dependence on oil and coal that fuel our energy needs today.\In truth, our Congress wants to make a statement to the world that the USA is a leader in climate change. In their efforts to do so, we the citizens they represent, will be forced to pay higher energy costs as well as watch as our economy deteriorate due to the misguidance of our Congress.\The Modern Whig Party has a tenet for energy and national security.\Why did we lump the environment with national security? Because elimination of our dependency on foreign oil is a national security issue as it takes away a significant amount of cards from our enemies. For example, cartels are illegal in the U.S. but, at the same time, we rely on the OPEC cartel for our oil. Expedited funding and research into viable green technology is part of the answer. It also is a major developing industry where we can make lots of money and create tons of jobs. At the same time, we represent a new generation of ""truth-buster."" At the turn of the 20th century, Teddy Roosevelt broke up the monopolies that stifled small business and economic growth. Now is the time to bust up the oil companies. These companies are designed, as they should be, to make money for their shareholders. We support this. The Modern Whig Party understands that corporations would actually be violating the rules if they strayed from their fiduciary duties toward their shareholders. However, oil companies have no business owning another energy resource such as coal. Believe it or not, clean coal technology exists and if permitted to grow, West Virginia and southeast Ohio will become the engine of a focus on natural gas, wind and solar power as outlined and paid for in the Pickens Plan. Lastly, please contact your congressmen and let them know we don't want the cap and tax bill passed.\Aubrey Jack Young is a Whig Party coordinator and with the Springfield Modern Whig Coalition.

3,"News-Leader\Rep. Roy Blunt's Senate campaign estimates liberal special interest groups have spent more than $500,000 in negative advertising attacking his record -- and it's not even 2010 yet.\The Missouri Republican Party says it spent about $10,000 for an online advertisement linking Secretary of State Robin Carnahan to the embattled community-organizing group ACORN.\Blunt, R-Springfield, and Carnahan, a Democrat, will be the likely contenders next year in the race to succeed Kit Bond in the U.S. Senate.\The most recent television ad from the League of Conservation Voters tying Blunt to Big Oil began airing in the Springfield market Thursday. It will air through Nov. 15 on every broadcast TV station in the region, according to Mike Palamuso, spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters.\This is the environmental advocacy group's third TV ad against Blunt since April. LCV is using the same ad nationwide, but changing the script for particular members of Congress it's targeting who voted against the American Clean Energy and Security Act -- better known as the cap-and-trade legislation.\Blunt says he's against the bill because it places a new tax on carbon dioxide emissions, causing electricity rates to skyrocket. The congressman says the carbon tax adversely harms states like Missouri, which gets nearly 85 percent of its electricity from coal-fired power plants.\Palamuso said Blunt's vote against the legislation is evidence he's in the pocket of Big Oil companies, which are lobbying against the bill because it requires them to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at refineries, likely increasing the price of gasoline.\The ad features a politician -- you can't see his face -- at an event going around the room shaking hands. As the politician shakes hands and slaps backs, he leaves oil on everyone he touches. ""There's a stain on Congressman Blunt's record,"" the announcer says. ""Big Oil and energy interests gave him over $1 million in campaign cash.""\By voting against the bill, the announcer says Blunt voted ""no"" to new green energy jobs, less carbon pollution and less dependence on foreign oil. ""Congressman Blunt, you're supposed to stand up to Big Oil, not turn your back on Missouri. Clean up your act,"" the announcer says in the TV ad as the politician leaves oil-drenched footprints across a gym floor.\Campaign finance records show Blunt has taken $1,012,398 from energy and natural resources interests since 1996, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\Since launching her campaign earlier this year, Carnahan has accepted $21,650 in contributions from oil industry lobbyists and their families, records show. That does not include money Carnahan has taken from other energy sector special interests, such as alternative-energy advocates.\The Blunt campaign says negative attack advertising from special interest groups is a sign of things to come next year in what's shaping up to be one of the closest watched Senate races in 2010.\""We would expect that left-wing groups like LCV, Pro-Vote, which represents ACORN and other liberal groups, to spend millions in false and negative attack ads in Missouri,"" Blunt spokes-man Rich Chrismer said.\Blunt has said the energy tax being pursued by Democrats in Congress would raise the price of everything because of increased electricity rates.\""That's why he voted against the energy tax that Robin Carnahan supports because it would cause Missourians' home energy prices to skyrocket and destroy jobs our families need,"" Chrismer said in a statement.\For her part, Carnahan has not taken a definitive stance on the legislation, in part because she's not a current member of Congress and won't get to vote on it.\""Robin has been clear when it comes to energy policy that she believes the energy status quo is hurting our economy, undermining our national security and damaging our environment -- so, despite what the entrenched corporate special interests and Washington insiders may say -- we need change,"" Carnahan spokesman Linden Zakula said in a statement.\Zakula said Carnahan favors ""a commonsense solution to promote alternative energy including wind, solar, and nuclear power to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, create jobs and curb pollution -- without sticking consumers, small businesses or family farms with the bill in these tough economic times.""\Chad Livengood covers state government and politics for the News-Leader.

The energy bill that narrowly passed 219-212 Friday in the U.S. House raises as many questions as answers about what future national energy policy might look like.
\
The bill calls for greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced 17 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050. Companies could buy permits from the government and later trade them among each other at steadily increasing prices designed to discourage emissions over time.
\
The proposed regulations are less stringent than proponents wanted but come at a steep price, ranging in estimate from $175 to more than $3,000 per household per year as families and businesses realize the far-reaching effect of more expensive energy. Higher energy costs are a general downer for the economy despite the happy talk about new ""green"" jobs, and initial estimates of the cost are almost certainly too low.
\
Missouri might be hit particularly hard. Speaking Friday with David Lile on KFRU, Rep. Roy Blunt said more than 80 percent of the electric power used in our state comes from coal-fired plants. Penalizing this kind of production would harm Missouri more than other states where support for energy change is most vigorous. He mentioned Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Henry Waxman, Democrats from California. Waxman has been a prime mover for cap-and-trade. Blunt serves on Waxman's committee, which finally approved the compromise bill bearing his name, needless to say without Blunt's vote.
\
Nobody can be against becoming more energy-independent and considering the environment, but reacting to climate change in this way is questionable policy. The costs are obvious, and the benefits are conjectural compared with other plans.
\
I'm persuaded by Bjorn Lomberg, a respected Danish scientist who advocates combating effects of climate change rather than trying to control emissions pre-emptively. He explains this view in his book ""Cool It.""
\
Lomberg says past emission control efforts have been notoriously ineffective and even the most draconian proposals, such as the Kyoto accords, would decrease harmful climate content by mere fractions of a percent with doubtful benefits. Better, he says, to spend less money with more certain effect directly combating projected troubles such as changes in agricultural production and disease rates, all of which are affected both positively and negatively by slightly rising temperatures with unsure net consequences.
\
A substantial body of scientific opinion is skeptical of Al Gore's version of global warming. Already the moniker has been changed to ""climate change,"" reflecting this ambivalence.
\
It's not at all clear the House energy bill will pass the Senate in anything close to its current form. House Speaker Pelosi seemed to have as a primary goal passing some sort of bill by July 4. She got some sort of bill -- not what she wanted but too much for many tastes. Some of the bill's internal elements deserve positive consideration, such as a stronger emphasis on nuclear production. Some should be watered down considerably in the Senate, an outcome almost certain where it will take 60 votes to pass a bill.
\
We shall see.

5,"Picking up where the U.S. House of Representatives left off late last month, a Senate committee is focusing its attention on climate change and clean energy. Comprehensive legislation is in the works, and unfortunately some senators intend to use H.R. 2454, the mandatory cap-and-trade bill that narrowly passed the House, as the blueprint.\At a recent hearing of the Environment & Public Works Committee, American Farm Bureau Federation President Bob Stallman conveyed our organization's opposition to H.R. 2454, saying the U.S. ""will be embarking on a fool's errand"" if mandatory caps are set on domestic carbon emissions and China, India and other countries don't follow suit.\Greenhouse gas emissions are global -- hence the terms global warming and global climate change -- and warrant a global response if they are a problem. Unilateral cap-and-trade legislation will have little or no impact on the climate. Most experts agree if H.R. 2454 worked exactly as planned, it would not lower temperatures by more than a tenth of a degree by 2050 -- hardly a return for the tremendous costs it will impose on the U.S. economy.\If weaning our nation off fossil fuels is the overarching goal of climate change legislation, an all-inclusive domestic energy plan is needed. Farm Bureau supports the development of all energy resources in the U.S. and along our coasts and believes Congress should focus on encouraging technological advances in the private sector to move us toward cleaner sources of energy.\Unfortunately, House lawmakers approved a bill that will leave a gaping hole in U.S. energy supplies by driving up the cost of carbon-based energy like coal and oil to reduce their use and providing no realistic alternatives in the short term.\For an energy-intensive sector like agriculture, this means virtually every input used by farmers and ranchers will jump in price -- gasoline, diesel, electricity, LP gas and nitrogen fertilizer. For consumers, home heating and cooling bills and fuel prices will increase, as will food and other goods because small businesses will have no choice but to pass on their higher cost of business.\As the debate continues in Congress, senators must decide what it is they wish to accomplish. If transferring massive amounts of money from the private sector to the federal government is the goal, then they are on the right path.\If energy security and a strengthened U.S. economy are the goals, they should scrap the ill-conceived, bloated and destructive blueprint passed by the House.\Charles E. Kruse is president of Missouri Farm Bureau and a fourth-generation farmer from Stoddard County."

The cap-and-trade system for reducing carbon dioxide emissions is more popular in Washington than Jefferson City. In Missouri, more dependent than most states on coal-fired electricity, cap-and-trade is bound to stir opposition.
\
Count the Columbia campus of the University of Missouri among the threatened entities, at least according to UM system President Gary Forsee, who recently sent word to Missouri's congressional delegation urging defeat of the bill.
\
Cap-and-trade has passed the U.S. House of Representatives and earlier this month passed the Senate Environment Committee. The Senate should drag feet.
\
The plan would cap greenhouse gas emissions for fossil fuel users. Those exceeding the limits would have to pay penalties. Those below could sell or stockpile credits. Missouri and MU are destined to be buyers, costing millions for MU, according to campus calculations.
\
Cap-and-trade would cause a big increase in overall energy cost to the United States, particularly in places where the most efficient fuel is used. Coal has every advantage except for emissions quality, which has been steadily improved in recent years. The threat from greenhouse gas is a controversial matter. No doubt it's worth concern, but proposed corrections with serious adverse economic impact deserve second-guessing.
\
Moreover, the United States can't solve the world's alleged climate problems even with the most aggressive plans, such as cap-and-trade. Already we have done more to mitigate air pollution than most other industrialized nations. A much better approach would be wholesale expansion of nuclear energy generation, which would mitigate the effects of coal in a positive way, enabling an excellent production system with positive long-term implications.
\
A theoretical satisfying argument can be made for cap-and-trade; its disincentive will cause polluters to quit fouling the air, making CO2 trading unnecessary. Even if this happens, it only will be at a cost approaching cap-and-trade.
\
Particularly now, when the economy is weak, is no time to add such a serious burden with such a questionable purpose. Quite a few believers contend the purpose is beyond question, but skepticism is substantial. On the eve of the big energy conference in Copenhagen, where hundreds of nations will discuss what do to about the climate, is no time for us to walk the plank alone.

7,"I told you in my column on July 10 that global warming was a hoax. Just when I thought the cap and trade lunatics could not be any more ignorant, along comes the Democrat-controlled Congress with the Waxman-Markey bill on climate change. Cap and tax or con and tax are all better names for this abhorrent bill.\The Democrats that control the House, led by Nancy Pelosi (D-People's Republic of San Francisco), passed this 1,200-page bill without a single person having read it. Let's talk about the consequences of this bill, so you can personally thank the Democrats you know, as you stand beside them in the unemployment line.\""Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket. Businesses would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money; they will pass that cost onto consumers."" Those are not my words; that was then-Sen. Barack Obama, during an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle last year. And then Democrats, because they're just not all that bright, elected him president. I guess they weren't paying attention, or they really, really enjoy paying higher utility bills. It's estimated the cost of gasoline, natural gas and electricity rates will jump $1,500 for the average family.\But it doesn't stop there. There is a provision in the bill that will cause the cost of a new home to rise by 30 percent, because the entire country would have to match California's building codes regarding the environment. You know, like toilets that flush with a Dixie cupful of water. Another provision provides unemployment benefits for three years to anyone laid off by this ""job creation"" bill (more dependence on government). The American Farm Bureau estimates that the cost of a dairy cow would increase by $175, beef cattle by $80. That means food is going up too. In a nod to the environmental wackos, the government will pay logging companies not to cut down trees. That means importing lumber. Refineries will close and companies will import gas too. And just as a sidebar, we import most of our oil from Canada and Mexico, not the Middle East, as the uneducated liberals would have you believe. In short, having to pay a fictitious ""carbon credit"" will motivate companies to close their plants in the U.S., and move to countries that aren't trying to kill themselves. The cap and trade bill rations energy. When we produce less of it, the price goes up.\The reason Democrats are shoving this down our throat is polls are showing a shift in thinking on global warming. Rasmussen reports their latest poll found 56 percent of Americans do not want to pay more to fight global warming. The EPA said that the Waxman-Markey bill would not reduce emissions by 2020 and warned about making hasty ""decisions based on a scientific hypothesis that does not appear to explain most of the available data."" For you liberals out there, ""hypothesis"" means ""guess.""\God help us.\Mike Hall lives in Springfield. He is a regular contributor to the News-Leader."

The University of Missouri is opposing federal legislation that would put caps on its greenhouse gas emissions because those limits would cost millions, UM System President Gary Forsee said in a letter to federal lawmakers.
\
Gary Forsee:
\
Sent letter to lawmakers
\
""Given the impact of such unattainable increases on the university's already hard-pressed budget, we urge you to oppose these bills or ensure that specific exemptions are included,"" Forsee wrote in the letter, sent to Missouri's entire congressional delegation.
\
Cap-and-trade legislation already passed in the House and passed out of the Senate Environment Committee this month. The bill would require industries to limit greenhouse gas emissions in a phased-in process starting in 2012 and running through 2050. Industries emitting more pollutants than allowed would have to buy credits to do so, and industries emitting less than the limits could sell, trade or save those unused emissions. The goal is to provide incentives to pollute less.
\
Under the current versions of the bill, MU's power plant would have to purchase credits, Forsee said. He estimated that doing so would cost between $5 million and $8 million during implementation -- more than half of MU's current annual energy budget of $13 million -- and another $1 million to $2 million every year afterward. Those figures are based on estimates from the Environmental Protection Agency and Energy Information Administration on the impact of the current House bill, MU spokeswoman Mary Jo Banken said.
\
U.S Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., was pleased to see Forsee's opposition to the plan, spokesman Paul Sloca said. Luetkemeyer voted against the House bill.
\
""Obviously, Blaine is encouraged by the letter and encouraged that the university and system are taking a stand on this,"" Sloca said. ""It's a reflection of what the majority of people in the Ninth District have already shared.""
\
Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is paying close attention to how universities, as well as small businesses and families, will be affected, her press secretary, Maria Speiser, said. McCaskill ""recognizes that climate change is a serious problem that must be addressed, but she won't support a bill that unfairly passes the costs of fixing it to Missourians and their businesses,"" Speiser said. ""People in Missouri have no choice but to be dependant on coal-based utility companies.""
\
MU already has worked to reduce energy consumption and will continue to develop solutions to the energy crisis, Forsee wrote. Banken said MU uses biomass fuels to replace 5 percent to 10 percent of coal and is building a new biomass-fired boiler to further reduce coal use by up to 25 percent.
\
But the university should do more, said Hank Ottinger, chairman of the Sierra Club's Osage Chapter.
\
""I think the flagship university of the state of Missouri should be a leader in CO2 reductions,"" he said.
\
""I'm happy they've made inroads on that with their power plant and they have a really very good, commendable energy conservation plan, but to stand in the way of fixing what is essentially a global problem? I can understand his point of view. Money's tight everywhere in the country except maybe on Wall Street. But to me, that's not an excuse. ... The U.S. has to be a leader on this, and we haven't been. Unless we are, other countries aren't going to step up.""

9,"Running all out, AmerenUE's Meramec plant in south St. Louis County burns 380 tons of coal an hour.\Built in 1953, it's the oldest piece of the utility's coal-fired fleet, and among the cheapest to operate. These days, however, it's less a symbol of cheap electricity than a potential casualty if Congress passes a law to slash greenhouse gas emissions.\The House of Representatives passed the sweeping, 1,500-page American Clean Energy and Security Act last month. The House bill, sponsored by Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Edward Markey, D-Mass., aims to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Debate is now under way in the Senate.\The bill's centerpiece would require major sources of greenhouse gases such as power plants and oil refineries to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and methane or pay a price.\The so-called ""cap and trade"" plan - because businesses would be allowed to buy and sell emissions credits- is causing high anxiety in states such as Missouri, which gets 80 percent of its electricity from coal. AmerenUE has said rates for Missouri electric customers would rise 10 to 20 percent by 2015 if Congress imposes carbon limits, and more in future years. The increase doesn't include other rate increases.\St. Louis-based Ameren said electric customers in Illinois would see the same kind of increases even though the state is less dependent on coal and the electricity market was deregulated in 2007. Under the House cap-and-trade plan, the federal government would initially provide free credits, or allowances, to help Ameren compensate for some of the 70 million tons of carbon dioxide, or CO2, produced by its power plants each year. But it would have to slash emissions in subsequent years or pay a penalty. Options for complying with the proposed regulations include building wind farms and other renewable generation to cut CO2, and investing in energy efficiency - both steps Ameren is already taking. It could also buy emissions allowances or so-called carbon offsets - permits to pollute beyond allowed levels by investing in projects that reduce CO2 output somewhere else.\Ameren has said carbon caps could also force it to mothball the Meramec plant.\The same fate could await other coal-fired power plants in the state and region, said Warren Wood, president of the Missouri Energy Development Association, the Jefferson City-based lobby for investor-owned utilities. ""They may not be justifiable to continue to operate, and you'll frankly be retiring a resource that still probably has decades of useful service in it,"" Wood said. ""That doesn't come cheap.""\One way or another, it's going to cost customers, said Shawn Schukar, the executive tasked with coordinating Ameren's climate strategy.\Energy efficiency and conservation has the most potential to hold rate impacts in check, Schukar said. The company recently kicked off a multi-year energy efficiency program for Missouri residential customers as part of a broader, $90 million effort to reduce electricity usage by 540 megawatts, or the equivalent of a medium-size power plant, by 2025. But not even aggressive cuts in energy usage will negate the effect of attaching a price to carbon, according to Ameren.\""If we're effective with energy efficiency deployment, you may not see your bill go up as much (because customers will use less electricity), but your rates will go up,"" Schukar said.\Estimates of the bill's impact on consumers vary widely. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates the annual impact on consumers to be a modest $80 to $111. The Congressional Budget Office projects $175 a year. Mark Pruitt, executive director of the year-old Illinois Power Agency, has watched the debate over climate legislation closely, but isn't predicting what the impact on electric rates would be in his state. He is concerned about the potential for increases in electricity prices, which would ultimately get passed along to consumers.\""I have a lot of concern,"" he said. ""That's my life. As a regulator, people will even come to me and say 'Why are prices higher?'""\The IPA functions as a broker that buys power on behalf of the state's two investor-owned electric utilities, Ameren and ComEd. The agency was established in response to a torrent of criticism and political outrage that followed a steep increase in electricity prices that came with deregulation of the state's wholesale power market in 2007.\Critics of Waxman-Markey predict a similar surge in electricity prices if the bill becomes law.\In fact, many Missouri energy executives say the EPA and CBO analyses are flawed and use assumptions that are too optimistic. They say Waxman-Markey disproportionately hurts states that are most dependent on coal. In a presentation to utility regulators last month, Duncan Kincheloe, CEO of the Missouri Public Utility Alliance, said California, the Pacific Northwest and New England would see electric rates drop while they would go up sharply in the Midwest.\Jeff Davis, a Republican member of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said he was worried about the impact on consumers. He has called on the commission to do its own study of the impact on electric customers so it can help advise the state's Congressional delegation. ""This is the largest wealth transfer in the history of mankind,"" Davis said. ""You're taxing Midwest consumers and you're basically giving utilities out on the West Coast that have wind and solar more than their fair share of (emissions) credits.""\Ameren hired CRA International, a consultancy in Boston, to analyze the potential impact of the Waxman-Markey bill. The firm is the same one that prepared a hotly debated report for the National Black Chamber of Commerce that concluded the measure would cost the United States 2.5 million jobs and cost the average worker $390 a year.\Waxman-Markey supporters challenge the dire projections. They say that it will produce jobs rebuilding the nation's energy infrastructure and that the costs of curbing CO2 emissions pale next to the consequences of doing nothing. Those costs, which aren't built into the analyses being discussed, include mercury pollution in rivers and streams from coal combustion and the rising costs for health care and environmental cleanups that go with dependence on oil and coal, said Kathleen Logan Smith, executive director of the Missouri Coalition for the Environment.\""The price we actually pay for a fossil-fuel based economy is enormous,"" Smith said. ""It just doesn't show up."" Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., has called the House cap-and-trade plan ""a double-barreled shotgun of lost jobs and higher energy taxes pointed at the Midwest and South."" Democrats Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., have generically expressed support for climate legislation. But neither has specifically endorsed the House version.\""We'll see what form (a Senate bill) takes,"" McCaskill recently said. ""We have to be very, very careful that we are not chasing jobs to India or China and that we are making sure that people who live in states like Missouri are not paying an unfair price for doing the right thing."" John Thompson, director of the coal transition program for the Clean Air Task Force, based in Boston, said the House bill did more than attach a price to carbon. It would return billions of dollars to help retrofit current coal plants to capture and store CO2 or build new clean coal plants. Doing so would take decades, but it could ultimately fund the replacement of 72 to 200 gigawatts of the nation's 300 gigawatts of coal-fired generation with clean coal, said Thompson, who lives in Carbondale, Ill. Meanwhile, the electric sector remains in limbo, waiting to see what happens. Utilities such as Ameren, which are looking at new power plants a decade years from now, are leaning toward natural gas.\""The uncertainty actually hurts coal, it hurts nuclear, it hurts wind,"" he said. It also hurts U.S. efforts to influence China and India to build cleaner generation.\Credit: Jeffrey Tomich jtomich@post-dispatchcom > 314-340-8320"
10,"Our View | Congress: a common sense agenda Fourth of eight editorals OPINION\ Protecting our air, water and land is not a partisan matter. Neither is protecting our planet from global warming. Both are matters of fact, economics and common sense.\ Americans want change. They want to see science - not party ideology - restored as the foundation of public policy, especially when it comes to energy and the environment.\ Here are some steps Congress can and should take now.\ - Energy policy. The United States needs a balanced energy policy that relies not just on producing more oil, gas and coal but also on conservation and a serious commitment to alternative energy. Congress should enact higher fuel economy standards, even though they're not popular with all Detroit auto makers. Already, some auto makers, notably Toyota and Ford, are cashing in on the growing demand for hybrids and gas-sippers.\ Congress must set goals for federal and state governments to use less oil and gasoline by switching to vehicles that get better mileage and/or burn ethanol. It should encourage more service stations to install pumps for E85 fuel, one that many new vehicles can use but drivers often can't find.\ Changes in tax policy could encourage American businesses and individuals to make smarter energy choices and provide tax incentives for the construction of energy efficient buildings and those that use energy sources such as solar power. Congress also should set goals to encourage large utilities to generate more power from alternative or renewable sources, such as hydroelectric and wind power.\ - Global warming. Over the last six years, the Bush administration and the Republican congressional majority tried to dismiss the huge body of data on global warming. Scientists know better. In the court of public opinion, the administration already looks foolish for refusing to acknowledge the reality of global warming, our role in it and the consequences of it. The longer we wait to address the problem, the more expensive and difficult it becomes.\ Congress must regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, even though the United States did not sign the international Kyoto Protocol. There's widespread agreement that a market-based ""cap-and-trade"" system such as that now used for reducing pollution that contributes to acid rain would be a good approach. It also would demonstrate to other nations that we feel a sense of urgency.\ - Protecting air, water and our national lands. The Bush administration has been pursuing an Orwellian strategy by pushing such policies as ""Clear Skies"" to relax air pollution controls and ""Healthy Forests"" to open more national forest to logging. When it failed to win congressional approval, the administration tried to implement those policies by re-writing regulations.\ The federal courts slapped down a recent attempt to weaken a rule that required older coal-fired power plants to install new pollution controls. But Congress needs to close loopholes that encourage utilities to keep using obsolete and dirty coal-fired plants.\ Congress also should restore the Clinton-era roadless wilderness rules in National Wilderness areas and rescind a Bush administration rule giving state governments more say in how that land is protected from development. And it should revisit decisions that opened millions of acres of protected lands to oil and gas drilling and mining.\ Although the details of how to reach them may differ, there is broad public consensus on environmental and energy goals. The American people don't want to live with polluted air, water and land. We understand the need to conserve fuel. We are impatient for new energy sources that will lessen our dependence on oil - with all its political ramifications - and reduce greenhouse emissions. We don't want our National Forests exploited by timber companies or our public lands despoiled by drilling and development.\ The challenge for the new Congress will be to build a sensible, forward-looking strategy on this common ground. Our health and the health of the planet demand it.\ Tomorrow : Education"
11,"The May 29th Post-Dispatch editorial ""False Choice: Inaction on global warming is no option"" pointed to the need to address climate change now.AmerenUE agrees. Our company has listened to our customers and realizes that not only do they want reliable service at the best possible price, but they also want us to be good stewards of the environment.We depend on coal-fired power for 85 percent of the electricity that we supply to our 2.4 million customers in Missouri and Illinois, so we are committed to being part of the solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.We demonstrated our commitment to improving air quality when we pioneered control technologies and reduced other power plant emission rates at plants across our service territory by greater than 70 percent. However, if not done right, reducing greenhouse gas emissions could be very expensive.Our analysis of the new climate change legislation - the Waxman-Markey Bill - indicates that this legislation alone would cause our customers' rates to rise 10 percent to 20 percent in 2015. That is why it is critical that this nation choose a reduction program that includes safeguards to minimize the costs to our customers.\Approved by the House Energy Committee, this new legislation would require utilities to significantly reduce the major greenhouse gas that power plants emit: carbon dioxide.If enacted, the impact to the economy of the Midwest, which is more dependent on coal-fired power than other areas, could be devastating - bringing additional pain to an area already hard hit by current economic conditions.Commerce and industry will move to areas that are less dependent on coal-fired power or overseas where requirements aren't as stringent.All this will mean less public commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, undercutting the goals of the legislation. The good news is that we can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions while limiting the impact on the economy.We can do this through appropriate policy designs that allow enough time to develop and deploy technologies. Today no proven, large-scale coal-emission reduction technology exists. \That situation makes it imperative that utilities receive free allocations of permits.Like the cap-and-trade system that worked well in helping to clean up the air in the 1990s, under this system, the current proposal calls for the government to first set a limit on annual carbon emissions and then to allow utilities to emit a certain level of CO2 carbon dioxide by giving them a limited number of permits. But the editorial criticizes the free allocation of permits, calling it a ""drawback."" That's simply not the case.\The alternative that often is recommended - an auction of all allocations - would force customers to pay forthesepermits because no large-scale emission technology is available to reducegreenhouse gas emissions under the caps required in the legislation.All revenue or taxes from this auction then would go to the government to determine how the money should be used.We believe it is better to leave the money in consumers' pockets.\Modeling the impact of the Waxman-Markey Bill shows that if auctions were used instead of allocating the permits for free, customer rates would increase between 30 percent and 50 percent in 2015.And, also important, whether allocations are auctioned or given away has no impact on the amount of carbon dioxide that is emitted - that is determined by the cap levels.\Ameren agrees that we need to do something to address climate change. However, the best way would be to ensure that we achieve the appropriate balance of emission reductions and consumer protection, especially here in the Midwest. \Thomas R. Voss is president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corp."
12,"WASHINGTON - With debate over climate change gaining momentum, Sen. Christopher S. ""Kit"" Bond, R-Mo., has emerged as one of Washington's biggest opponents to pro-environment legislation at the heart of President Barack Obama's first budget.\The senior Missouri senator, who began an offensive against a proposed limit on carbon emissions in February, stepped up his criticisms in the last two weeks, engineering an amendment in the Senate's $3.5 trillion budget that could throw a roadblock in front of any effort to pass climate change laws.\Under the amendment, senators who see a danger of job loss as a result of greenhouse gas regulations can hold up the bill, forcing the Senate to reach 60 votes to overturn the objection and continue debate.\Bond's proposal still has to survive conference with the House, but it comes from the heart of the senator's argument against greenhouse gas regulations, something he calls little more than a new tax on electricity that will hurt regions like Missouri that rely on coal to power homes and factories.\""Every time you turn on a light, buy groceries, put gas in your car or truck, you'll pay more,"" Bond said last week.\Just across the aisle and the Mississippi River, Dick Durbin, D-Ill., staked out the opposite position. ""Can America afford to wait? Can this world afford to wait? Can't we see the ominous elements coming at us?"" Durbin said in a floor speech. ""But we better face it. We'd better face it if we want to face our children.""\With last week's budget debate and the first look at a draft bill detailing a cap-and-trade system, members of Congress from the region have begun choosing sides in what is shaping up as one of the most contentious debates under Obama's young administration.\A carbon cap-and-trade system would give industries the ability to buy and sell pollution rights under an ever-decreasing ceiling on emissions.\The primary conflict over the system comes from how much it will cost consumers. Durbin and Obama have said carbon cap-and-trade credits are needed to launch America's energy policy in a cleaner direction, creating jobs in a new green energy industry. But Bond and Republican leadership argue a cap would have an adverse effect on an already struggling economy.\Even with the weight of the White House behind a cap-and-trade system, there are substantial hurdles to clear, especially in the Senate, where Democrats may struggle to muster the 60 votes necessary to block a Republican filibuster and to overcome Bond's amendment if it remains in the final version.\The Senate's budget passed with several other amendments from Democrats and Republicans looking to curb a carbon-cap's potential economic impact, such as resolutions against any law that would raise electricity or gas prices. Bipartisan support for these amendments could be an early sign of difficulties to come for the legislation.\Somewhere between Bond and Durbin is Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. She supports curbing climate change but shares concerns similar to Bond's over how legislation will affect consumers.\""We must do something because of the reality of global warming,"" McCaskill said in a statement. ""Having said that, I will only support a bill that looks after the people in my state who have no choice but to be dependent on coal-based utility companies. Whatever monies are generated cannot create a bunch of rich people. It must go back into the pockets of the people and small businesses that will face higher utility costs.""\Climate legislation will need the support of moderate Democrats like McCaskill if it has any chance of surviving, said David Doniger, policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council's climate center. But Doniger is confident that as negotiations progress, there will be enough support to pass a bill by the end of the year.\Even the coal industry seems to view carbon regulations as inevitable.\Carol Raulston, spokeswoman for the National Mining Association, sees a slower timeline than Doniger but said she expected a cap to pass by the end of Obama's term. Her organization's main priority is not fighting the legislation but working with Congress to support carbon capture technology ""so coal can stay in the mix,"" she said."
13,"WASHINGTON - Late this morning, Sen. Claire McCaskill will receive a shipment like those that arrived earlier this week at other offices of Missouri and Illinois senators: tens of thousands of oversized yellow postcards from rural utility customers raising concerns about climate change legislation in Congress.\The postcard drive, coordinated by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, is timed for the introduction in the Senate today of a new version of cap-and-trade legislation.\In June, the Democratic-run House passed its version of a controversial anti-global warming bill despite concerns by some in the Missouri and Illinois delegations that Midwestern coal-burning states would incur unfair burdens.\Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of California and John Kerry of Massachusetts, sponsors of the Senate legislation, hope to get agreement on their bill this fall and then begin what surely would be a difficult conference with the House aiming at a final version.\Boxer and Kerry will face questions about whether still another complex and far-reaching bill can advance while health care legislation gets riveted together. They might be explaining, too, why they're offering a bill that is even tougher in some respects than what the House passed.\According to a draft of the new legislation obtained by the Post-Dispatch, the Senate bill will set a more aggressive emissions reduction target than the House did - 20 percent by 2020 rather than 17 percent.\In another diversion from the House likely to draw the ire of farm states, the Senate bill drops a House provision giving biofuels a break when calculating their greenhouse gas emissions. But in a change that some utilities and critics may like, the Senate bill avoids spelling out the percentages of emission allowances industries would receive, therefore enabling utilities and other polluters to get more of the valuable credits in the bargaining to come.\""I think it's a very solid start and that environmentalists will praise it,"" said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Watch advocacy group.\McCaskill is among Senate Democrats that environmental advocates like O'Donnell hope to sway. They have work to do, judging by her comments in an interview Tuesday.\""I haven't been convinced yet that the cap-and-trade system is the way to address climate change,"" she said. ""We don't want to create another market that is fraught with problems and not enough oversight. We just went through a meltdown because of problems with Wall Street and investment firms.""\McCaskill added her belief that the climate debate ""is going to be very similar to the health care problem in that it's complicated with lots of land mines along the way."" She said she wants Congress to do a better job of pressing for pollution reductions in China and India. ""I want us to lead the world in climate change, but I don't want us to be suckers,"" she said.\Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond, R-Mo., said while receiving his postcards that he recognizes the need to reduce emissions but objects strongly to the paths laid out thus far to do so.\""This is being pushed, absolutely, by the people of California and the people of New England who don't rely on coal for electricity,"" he said.\Rep. John Shimkus, R-Collinsville, said he worries that the Senate version is designed ""to appease the environmental community, versus a process that could get something onto the floor of the Senate. ""What everyone does agree is that if you're going to limit use (of coal), you're going to increase costs - and in this environment, it's the worst time to increase costs,"" he said. Shimkus believes any compromise must trigger more use of nuclear power, an issue that prompted a significant split in the business community this week. Illinois-based Exelon, the nation's biggest nuclear operator, on Monday quit the U.S. Chamber of Commerce over the chamber's ongoing criticisms of climate change legislation.\Barry Hart, CEO of the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives, said that while delivering the postcards in Washington, he hopes to persuade senators of the importance of climate change legislation to the 1.2 million people in rural Missouri who get electricity from coops.\Hart said the tougher emission limits in the Senate bill would make it harder on Missouri, but that he would be heartened if the legislation avoids detailing the amount of emission credits that would be awarded.\""That would mean that consumers will be at the table and have a chance to make electricity affordable,"" he said.\Climate change timeline, issues\Today: The Senate will release climate change legislation, resuming the contentious debate that peaked in June with House passage of a cap-and-trade, anti-global warming bill. Proposal: Under cap-and-trade, utilities and other industries would be given flexibility to buy and sell the right to pollute under ever-decreasing limits.\Sectional divide: The legislation is pitting coal-burning states in the Midwest and South against other regions of the country.

14,"SEATTLE * Washington lawmakers have tried and failed in recent years to make polluters pay for their carbon emissions to fight climate change. Now, voters will get to decide.\An initiative on the November ballot asks voters whether the state should impose the nation's first direct carbon tax on the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline.\Sponsors say residents have a moral responsibility to curb greenhouse gas emissions, and a carbon tax is the best way to do it. The tax encourages businesses to conserve or switch to clean energy by making fossil fuels more expensive, and it makes the tax system fairer by using the revenue to reduce other taxes, they say.\Businesses say the tax will drive up fuel and energy costs and put Washington companies at a competitive disadvantage.\And in a move that has bewildered some, major environmental and other groups including those that backed Gov. Jay Inslee's proposal last year to cap emissions and make carbon polluters pay oppose the initiative. They say it takes the wrong approach.\Yoram Bauman, an economist who founded Carbon Washington, the grass-roots group that gathered more than 350,000 signatures to qualify Initiative 732, defended it as great climate and tax policy.\""It does almost everything right for Washington,"" he said.\Audubon Washington supports it.\""Our members came down on the side of urgency. We don't have time to wait,"" said Gail Gatton, the group's executive director. ""Climate change is happening, and this is our best available option right now to protect birds.""\But the Sierra Club, Washington Environmental Council and the advocacy group Front and Centered say the initiative is the wrong carbon-pricing approach and will hurt the state's revenues. Whereas Inslee's pollution fee would have raised money for education, transportation, clean energy and programs to help disadvantaged communities affected by climate change, Initiative 732 provides no such investments, critics say.\""It's not a path that makes sense for our communities,"" said Rich Stolz, executive director of OneAmerica, which works on social justice issues. Stolz said the initiative ignores climate justice and lacks input from communities of color.\Stolz's group is part of a coalition that worked on an alternative carbon-pricing measure. Last-minute talks between that coalition and I-732 supporters to collaborate on one ballot measure fizzled last year.\The initiative is designed to be revenue neutral, meaning the tax revenue increase from fossil fuels would be mostly offset by decreases in other taxes. In this case, revenues would be returned to people and businesses by cutting the state sales tax by one point, virtually eliminating business taxes for manufacturers and providing rebates for working families, sponsors say.\A state analysis, however, estimates the measure could cost the state about $800 million in lost revenues over the first six fiscal years. Initiative sponsors dispute the state's analysis, saying it double-counted the rebates in the first year.\The carbon tax is modeled after one in the nearby Canadian province of British Columbia. California has a cap-and-trade program, which limits emissions and allows carbon polluters to buy and trade pollution credits. If approved, Washington's carbon tax starts at $15 a ton of carbon emissions in July, goes up to $25 the next year and incrementally increases afterward.\The Washington State Tree Fruit Association, which represents growers, packers and marketers, is among those opposed.\It takes a lot of fuel to grow and transport produce, and the tax will be paid by those in the state, not competitors outside it, said Jon Devaney, the group's president.\""Raising food prices in Washington state will make us less competitive compared to others,"" he said.\Credit: PHUONG LE; Associated Press"
15,"When the Senate takes up legislation next month to confront global warming, environmental groups will have some fervent new allies: evangelicals and other Christian activists.\Concerned about what they see as a moral and biblical issue, religious groups from the right are joining with environmental organizations from the left in supporting strong measures to fight global warming.\Some Christian leaders are using the clout they have built up in Republican circles to lobby conservatives in Congress to support regulations on greenhouse-gas emissions.\""When evangelicals speak, Republicans listen,"" said Richard Cizik, vice president of government affairs for the National Association of Evangelicals. ""And Republicans, frankly, are listening to what we're saying.""\For many religious groups, global warming isn't a political or environmental issue. It's a threat to God's creation.\""It's not a blue state, red state, scientific, or even a green issue,"" said Cizik, whose organization represents 45,000 churches. ""It's a spiritual issue. And that, above all else, is why evangelical Christians should be concerned.""\The once-tiny Christian environmental movement began accelerating quickly in 2006, when 85 prominent evangelical leaders signed on to the Evangelical Climate Initiative calling for action on global warming. The number has climbed to more than 100.\""It's a bit out of the ordinary for evangelicals to be involved with this issue,"" said Jim Jewell, chief operating officer of the Evangelical Environmental Network, a group that educates and mobilizes Christians on environmental issues. ""The evangelical involvement with climate has kind of shaken the political landscape a bit.""\In March, dozens of prominent Southern Baptist leaders called on followers to acknowledge human contributions to global warming, and demanded bold action to address climate change.\They said the church's cautious approach was ""too timid"" in promoting stewardship of God's creation.\""To abandon these issues to the secular world is to shirk from our responsibility..."" they declared. ""The time for timidity regarding God's creation is no more.""\Jonathan Merritt, the 25-year-old seminary student from Atlanta who organized the Baptist environmental declaration, said younger Baptists in particular were relieved to see church leaders take a bold public stance.\Young religious voters aren't abandoning opposition to abortion and gay marriage - issues usually associated with the religious right - but they seem more willing than their parents to look at a broader spectrum of political positions, Merritt said.\""Younger Christians are finding it more pressing to live a life that is consistent with the teachings of Jesus Christ ... rather than toe a party line,"" Merritt said.\The Rev. Larry Rice, director of the New Life Evangelistic Center in St. Louis, has been an outspoken advocate for global warming legislation. The left-leaning minister said Missouri is ""in the dark age when it comes to renewable energy"" and has argued for years that Christians have an obligation to protect the environment.\""There's an ethical principle that runs the whole thread of Christianity here,"" Rice said. ""You can't just say that you love your neighbors as yourself and yet be totally indifferent to how your use of fossil fuels is directly contributing to global warming around the world.""\'Cap-and-trade'\Evangelicals will join an army of lobbyists and lawmakers now suiting up for battle over the most sweeping environmental legislation in years, which the Senate intends to debate early in June.\The bill, sponsored by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman, I-Conn., and John W. Warner, R-Va., would create a program known as ""cap-and-trade"" to limit harmful carbon dioxide emissions.\Under the bill, companies, individuals and government agencies would see their greenhouse gas emissions capped at an annually decreasing level, with the goal of setting emissions in 2050 at 30 percent of 2005 levels.\Entities that come in below their cap could sell their remaining credits to others that pollute beyond their limits. The effect is a sort of carbon tax that encourages pollution reduction.\The bill is already the subject of intense political gamesmanship. Some business lobbyists fear the costs of complying with pollution caps and the penalties for exceeding them. Some environmental groups say the standards are too weak.\Backers of the bill hope support from the religious right will help pressure some Republicans to support the legislation.\""There's a good deal of interaction with folks at traditionally religious organizations, who have joined with environmental organizations to begin work on this,"" said David Sandretti, a spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental interest group.\focus on Missouri\As the action unfolds on Capitol Hill, Missouri's two senators are likely to play important roles.\Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond, a Republican, has for years been one of the loudest critics of the science behind global warming and is a key opponent of the Lieberman-Warner bill.\The Environmental Defense Fund identified Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., as one of 10 ""senators to watch."" McCaskill is undecided on the cap-and-trade bill, saying she favors the concept but worries about how it might affect utility costs for poor people.\McCaskill's staff has discussed cap-and-trade with religious leaders urging her to support the initiative.\""We're paying special attention to Senator McCaskill,"" said the Rev. Jim Ball, a national spokesman for the Evangelical Climate Initiative.\McCaskill's staff also has talked about the issue with religious leaders working with the National Religious Partnership for the Environment, a broad coalition of religious groups that includes Catholic, Jewish and other organizations.\""This is far and away the single highest environmental priority for the American religious community,"" said Paul Gorman, the partnership's executive director.

16,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. * Gov. Jerry Brown's aggressive plea for lawmakers to renew California's signature climate change law proved fruitful last week, bolstering his credibility as a world leader in the fight against global warming.\It also again showcased the Democrat's political skill in Sacramento, where just months earlier he helped convince the largely Democratic Legislature to raise gas prices to pay for road and bridge projects.\Next up: Fulfilling a pledge to tackle California's affordable housing crisis when lawmakers head back to the Capitol in August. After that, he will keep promoting an ambitious slate of climate policies in the state and beyond, and work at home to secure the future of lofty efforts to build a bullet train and re-engineer the state's water system.\Brown, 79, pursues projects that will exist long after he leaves the governor's office but resists the word ""legacy"" at every opportunity. Longtime observers say his win on the cap-and-trade program to reduce carbon emissions, and how he spends the last 17 months of his final term, will inevitably shape how he's remembered. Brown previously served two terms as governor, ending in the early 1980s.\""Without question, it's a victory for him on several levels,"" Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a professor of public policy communication at the University of Southern California, said of the deal on cap and trade, which puts a limit on carbon emissions and requires polluters to obtain permits to release greenhouse gases. ""He denied that this was about his legacy, but it was.""\Beyond California, Brown is a special adviser for a U.N. climate conference in Germany this November. He's also planning a global climate conference in San Francisco next year and leading an alliance among states, cities, businesses and others to help the United States meet the goals of the global Paris climate agreement after President Donald Trump pulled out.\""There is a lot of work to be done in California, but there's a lot of persuasion and encouragement needed throughout the whole world,"" Brown told The Associated Press in a phone interview Wednesday.\To help win a climate deal, the governor pledged to work with lawmakers on an affordable housing agreement before the year's end. Rent prices in the state have risen faster than incomes, and roughly 1.5 million homes are lacking for low-income renters.\Fixing the crisis has proved a near intractable issue in the Capitol, with lawmakers rejecting a housing plan that Brown put forward last year.\The governor has long argued for streamlining regulations that can stifle construction before providing more money for building projects. But now he has agreed to pursue long-term funding as part of a deal, a commitment that may have secured additional Democratic votes on cap and trade.\""There's no magic wand for housing prices,"" Brown said. ""That is not an easily solved matter.""\As Brown's tenure wraps up, two of his signature, but troubled, infrastructure projects are looming large: construction of a high-speed rail system between Los Angeles and San Francisco and two giant tunnels to carry northern California water to the south.\Brown has aggressively pushed for the bullet train since taking office for the second time in 2010, despite critics complaining about its high cost to taxpayers and whether it's even necessary. Its price estimates have skyrocketed from $40 billion to $64 billion, and future funding is not certain.\A chunk of money for rail that comes in from cap and trade could be renegotiated in 2024 due to a constitutional amendment passed by lawmakers this week. If voters approve it, lawmakers will get a clean slate on determining how that money is spent.\Dan Richard, chairman of the California High Speed Rail Board, acknowledges the difficulties of getting lawmakers to spend money on a project that won't provide immediate results. Construction is underway for a segment connecting San Jose to Bakersfield, scheduled to be operational in 2025.\""We're talking about committing public dollars right now to something that does not have immediate benefits,"" Richard said. But, he added, ""in seven years I'm less concerned about being able to make the argument.""\Meanwhile, the $16 billion project to reroute California's water from north to south through two giant tunnels is awaiting key federal and state approvals after winning early support in from federal wildlife officials.\The state also is battling with water agencies over who will pay for what parts of the project. But Brown expressed confidence the project will move forward and that his successor will see its benefits.\""This project is teed up in a way that it never has been before, and it will proceed within the next 15 or 16 months,"" he said. ""So I think the next governor, whether they'd like to talk about it or not, I think there will be a strong inclination to stay the course.""\Credit: KATHLEEN RONAYNE; Associated Press"
17,"Climate change is an urgent national security issue. So says a recent National Intelligence Assessment and an influential group of retired military officers and defense experts at the Center for Naval Analysis, a nonprofit policy analysis group. Left unchecked, they say, global warming will sow political instability and conflict in already-fragile parts of the world, places such as Pakistan, the Middle East and Africa.\""We're a global society now. We can't isolate ourselves from that kind of thing,"" said former Sen. John Warner, R-Va, during a recent visit to St. Louis.\Mr. Warner was a panelist at a forum on national security, energy and climate change sponsored by the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center.\Mr. Warner and retired Vice Admiral Dennis McGinn, another forum panelist, said climate change and energy security already are straining the nation's military capability. Those stresses probably will increase.\There are a lot of ways to think about global warming: an environmental problem, a technological challenge, a moral issue. It's all of that and much more.\A 2008 National Intelligence Assessment concluded that climate change will affect the United States directly and cause the existing problems of poverty, environmental degradation and ineffective leadership in other countries to worsen.\Scientists already are predicting that climate change will alter rainfall patterns and temperatures around the globe. That threatens agricultural production for large numbers of desperately poor people.\We can't expect them to quietly starve. Crop failures in Africa probably would produce huge waves of migrants to Europe. Similar failures in Central or South America could send millions more fleeing to our shores. Competition for scarce resources - oil, clean drinking water and food - would increase.\All of that makes it more likely that the U.S. military would be called into action, either to provide humanitarian assistance or to go into combat.\The threat isn't just theoretical. We're already paying a price for the nation's - and the military's - dependence on oil.\The United States consumes 25 percent of the world's oil production but controls just 3 percent of the supply. Even if we drilled our every drop, world markets would remain tight and prices high.\The U.S. military is among the nation's largest oil consumers, fueling everything from ships and aircraft to tanks and trucks - even generators at military installations around the world.\Our insatiable thirst for oil sends billions of dollars overseas every day, enriching regimes that oppose us. Russia's resurgence largely is financed by oil revenue. So is Iran's.\But that's only part of the price, as a new report by the Center for Naval Analysis points out. Protecting oil supplies for ourselves and our allies involves American forces deployed around the world at enormous cost to taxpayers.\It also means we do business with repressive regimes, which undermines our diplomatic leverage and foreign policy objectives.\Congress is debating a bill that would limit greenhouse gas emissions and encourage development of alternative energy sources. Most people see the so-called cap-and-trade bill as an environmental measure, but it has major implications for national security.\Cutting our dependence on foreign oil would help avoid the worst consequences of climate change and increase energy independence. It would help spur development of technology to reduce the military's energy demands and enable it to project force more efficiently and less expensively.\Global climate change poses too great a threat - to the environment, yes, but also to national security - for us to fail to act.\Congress should protect America by passing cap-and-trade bill."

Nationally and locally, evangelicals disagree on what God's mandate would be on global warming.
\
""I don't see this as a spiritual issue,"" said Steve Reeves, pastor of Rejoice Free Will Baptist Church. ""I believe people need more from church than ... a position on global warming,"" he said.
\
Pastor Kevin Larson of Karis Community Church, an interdenominational congregation with Baptist ties, said global warming is absolutely a Christian issue because of God's cultural mandate to be good stewards of creation. Larson said evangelicals accept that murder is a sin but have a hard time thinking of pouring motor oil in a storm drain as something they need to repent. ""I see both as sins,"" he said.

This debate among members of the denomination heated up again in response to the Warner-Lieberman Climate Security Act, a bill that failed last week in Congress but aimed to create a cap-and-trade law. The law would have set limits for companies' carbon dioxide emissions. If a company didn't use its full allowance, it could sell the remainder to other corporations.
\
The ""We Get It!"" campaign came out against the bill in May and aims to secure signatures from 1 million Christians on a statement against environmental policies that would restrict industry because, it argues, the policies could negatively affect the poor.
\
""Our stewardship of creation must be based on biblical principles and factual evidence. We face important environmental challenges but must be cautious of claims that our planet is in peril from speculative dangers like man-made global warming,"" the statement reads.
\
Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, came out against the bill in early June.
\
On the other side of the debate are groups like the National Association of Evangelicals and the Evangelical Climate Initiative, who say ignoring ""creation care"" is an abomination against God.
\
But there aren't just two sides to this debate. Some local pastors say they and their churches are somewhere in the middle.
\
""The media has fun with playing both extremes, but we've got to learn to get along here and find a workable solution, and typically that means compromise on both sides,"" said Pastor Mark West of First Church of the Nazarene.
\
Pastor Dave Cover of The Crossing, an evangelical Presbyterian church, said politics are rarely discussed at his church, which has no official position on global warming. ""We're not scientists and have zero education to speak authoritatively on whether our current experience of global warming is man-made or simply something that's cyclical,"" Cover said.
\
Others are not so middle-of-the-road with their opposition to the idea of global warming.
\
David Tolliver, interim executive director of the Missouri Baptist Convention, said there are members of the convention who are concerned about global warming, which he credited to being around college campuses. He also said the issue has become important with college students but that he doesn't want to start the debate it would take to create a convention-wide official position.
\
""As long as I'm executive director, we're not going to get into it. We've got too many other things to do, and I'm just not going to let us get into a battle about something I'm not convinced is true,"" Tolliver said.
\
""Confrontational evangelist"" George Smock, also known as Brother Jed, preaches to college students on the University of Missouri campus. He likens the evangelical global warming debate to a certain fable involving fears of a falling sky.
\
""Evangelicals who are advocating policies that promote restrictions on our economy are like the silly Chicken Little,"" Smock said.
\
""If indeed the climate is warming, it could be God's doing, for the sky is going to fall one day,"" Smock said, and quoted 2 Peter 3:10: ""And the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up.""
\
This is an attitude that bothers Larson, who said he thinks many evangelicals believe in the rapture, or that God will remove believers from the Earth, but Larson said the Bible indicates Jesus will return and live on Earth, that God will restore the Earth. ""Since God is going to restore all things, we should work with him and not against him by destroying everything,"" Larson said.
\
Brian Kaylor, a Baptist minister and communications specialist for the Baptist General Convention, said it is exciting to see more evangelicals waking up to the importance of environmental devastation but many are only giving ""lip service"" to ""creation care.""
\
""The primary problem is a lot of these leaders have aligned themselves very strongly with the Republican party. ... They are toeing the party line more than dealing with the issue,"" Kaylor said, citing a statement by Richard Land that it was time for evangelicals to consummate their marriage to the Republican Party.
\
""The Bible is abundantly clear that the Earth is the Lord's and everything in it, and we are supposed to take care of the Earth, which brings glory and praise to God and helps humans ... to worship God because we see the beauty of creation,"" Kaylor said. ""I don't see how we can sit by and let creation be destroyed.""
\
Hank Ottinger, vice chairman of the Osage Group of the Missouri Chapter of the Sierra Club, said no local evangelical churches had contacted the Sierra Club for information on global warming but that he's pleased more evangelicals are coming to the environmental cause.
\
""I am really pleased these organizations are reading their Bible a little more closely. For a long time, I guess the more far right or more hard-core evangelicals were either in denial about planet change or thought it irrelevant because the world was going to be gone up in smoke or rapture,"" Ottinger said.

19,"President Barack Obama is moving swiftly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He cleared the way this week for California to set strict new carbon-dioxide standards for cars and trucks. A dozen other states are poised to adopt the standards once they are approved.\At the same time, Mr. Obama told federal regulators to push ahead with higher fuel-economy requirements. Congress approved new mileage standards in a 2007 energy bill. It mandates average fuel-economy rates of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, but rules to achieve it never were finalized.\Mr. Obama undoubtedly expected some opposition from Republicans. With Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, however, he would seem assured of accomplishing his larger goal of combating global warming.\But that's not the way things are working out. Midwestern Democrats - including Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, an early and influential Obama supporter - are starting to push back. They fear overly aggressive action on climate change could cost badly needed manufacturing jobs when state economies are reeling. On Monday, Ms. McCaskill urged the president ""not to do anything that will harm the auto industry.""\Auto executives oppose both California's bid to set strict carbon-dioxide standards and federal efforts to increase fuel economy. With new-car sales plunging, automakers and industry groups say they say they cannot meet the proposed standards. Imposing them could seriously harm struggling U.S. manufacturers, they say.\That's not a threat to be taken lightly, especially now, as the cascade of bleak economic news continues. Boeing announced 5,500 more job cuts on Wednesday, and another 75,000 job cuts in several industries were announced Monday. That brings the number of jobs lost since the recession began in December 2007 to more than 2.6 million.\Automakers' claims probably are at least somewhat overstated. Japanese car companies make cars in a single plant for domestic, European and American markets with different emissions and safety standards. U.S. diesel engine manufacturers build power plants for on- and off-road equipment - each with its own emissions standards - in the same plants.\But the debate about auto-emissions rules foreshadows a larger struggle. Mr. Obama and Democratic legislative leaders are promising a bill to cap greenhouse gas emissions by year's end.\That probably will impose difficult challenges on Midwestern states, where heavy manufacturing still is a big part of the job base and where coal-fired power plants supply most of the electricity. Missouri gets more than 80 percent of its power from burning coal, which is a major source of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.\Mr. Obama favors a cap-and-trade system for reducing emissions. Such a plan would freeze the amount of permitted greenhouse gas discharges and establish a market for emissions credits. Companies that cut emissions would sell ""credits"" to companies whose emissions increased.\In the short term, we hope the economic impact of new emission requirements on Missouri, Illinois and other Midwestern states can be mitigated. But long term, the nation cannot afford continued foot-dragging on climate change.\A study published this week shows that even if emissions were cut drastically, problems caused by global warming will continue - imposing a whole different set of costs and problems, from rising sea levels to Dust Bowl-like droughts.\The trick is to balance the short-term costs of reducing emissions with the potentially disastrous long-term costs of global warming. And to understand that the less carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere now, the less our children must worry about it in decades to come."
20,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency seems poised to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, and possibly also from vehicles. New EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson asked her staff last week to prepare a document that clears the way for new rules limiting carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. Those emissions are a major contributor to global warming.\This week, EPA officials indicated they may go even further, by setting a national standard for greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks. Vehicles and power plants together account for about 62 percent of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions.\There's no question where President Barack Obama stands. During his address to Congress this week, he indicated support for ""a market-based cap on carbon pollution.""\The EPA could deliver it now, simply by rewriting rules established under the Clean Air Act. That would avoid the risk of political stalemate in a Congress that faces numerous other serious challenges on the economy, national defense and health care.\Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA can act without Congressional authority - the U.S. Supreme Court made that clear in 2007. The question is whether it should act. The answer is no.\There's no question that a carbon cap is coming, and the sooner the better.\Scientists say that global warming is already occurring. Because carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for so long, climate change will continue to worsen in decades to come.\The United States can - indeed it must - take action now to stave off long-term consequences that are potentially even more disastrous than what we've already created.\Equally important, as Mr. Obama acknowledged in his speech on Tuesday, are the potential economic benefits. He warned that China has launched a major effort to create an energy efficient economy. Germany and Japan have leapt ahead of the U.S. in solar power, while Korea is making batteries for hybrid vehicles.\""The country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century,"" Mr. Obama said.\With such high stakes, the temptation to act administratively is understandable. But doing so would be a mistake.\Capping carbon emissions by administrative rule would be ineffective. Opponents would immediately file suit.\They'd eventually lose, of course. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that the EPA not only has the right, it also has the obligation to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. But while the appeals continued, implementation of the cap would be delayed.\More importantly, though, a carbon cap-and-trade system created by Congress would likely be better designed and more palatable than one created by administrative fiat. It could mitigate problems in states like Missouri that depend heavily on coal-fired electrical generating plants.\Such a system would limit total carbon emissions and establish a market so businesses could buy ""credits"" for additional emissions.\The EPA's tough talk about limiting carbon emissions already is putting pressure of Congress to quickly address global climate change. That's a good thing. But shaping the system that limits greenhouse gas emissions should be done by Congress. And soon."
21,"In confirmation hearings last week for her new job as secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton asserted that President-elect Barack Obama would lead ""a global and coordinated response"" to climate change.\But will the incoming president dip early into his reservoir of political capital to try to restrict carbon emissions, the linchpin in controlling the growth of global warming? Will environmental agencies under his control seek to prevent building more coal-fired utilities?\Referring last month to the approach of the administration of President George W. Bush to climate change, Obama asserted that ""the time for delay is over, the time for denial is over. We all believe what the scientists have been telling us for years now, that this is a matter of urgency and of national security, and it has to be dealt with in a serious way.""\For now, Obama and the Congress are moving in directions all but ignored by the outgoing White House to generate ""green jobs"" with programs that have environmental and energy efficiency benefits. Last weekend, the transition office released a study projecting that 459,000 jobs would be generated by the end of next year in the $775 billion economic stimulus plan he envisions.\People would be put to work developing renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power as part of a plan to double the production of alternative energy in three years, Obama said.\If most Illinoisans in Washington - and Obama is among them - get their way, part of the stimulus funding would be devoted to beginning the FutureGen, the $1 billion public-private partnership seeking to build the world's first zero-emission coal-fired power plant in southeastern Illinois.\Yet thorny questions remain. There is little likelihood that Obama will want to proceed this year with cap-and-trade legislation to reduce the growth in greenhouse gas emissions.\But by most accounts, he can move aggressively without Congress relying on a Supreme Court ruling that carbon dioxide - a principle cause of global warming - is a pollutant and should be regulated. That would spark a new realm of regulations governing electricity and other industries that could be used as a potent tool to block construction of new power plants without elaborate technology.\""I actually think that this would be more important than a climate bill,"" remarked Joseph Romm, an Energy Department official in the administration of President Bill Clinton and now a senior analyst at the Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.\In Romm's calculation, Obama could fare better with climate change legislation in 2010 - when, presumably, the economy has turned the corner.\Sentiments run deep waiting for Obama to act.\""What the anti-coal jihadists can expect from a President Obama is disappointment,"" the National Mining Association's Luke Popovich said. ""... To take coal off the table and drive it back underground would be catastrophic when we are staring into an economic abyss.""\STLtoday.com/science All that's innovative and new in science and technology."

ALBANY, New York (AP) -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce calls itself the ""voice of business,"" yet a growing number of companies from Apple to Exelon are saying it doesn't speak for them when it denies global warming and lobbies against climate change legislation.
\
Yesterday, Mohawk Fine Paper, a privately held paper manufacturer based in Cohoes, New York, joined Apple, Exelon, Pacific Gas and Electric and the Public Service Co. of New Mexico in resigning membership in the chamber, which represents more than 3 million member companies.
\
George Milner, Mohawk's vice president for environmental affairs, said it hurts the company's credibility as an advocate for environmental protection when it belongs to an organization that vigorously opposes action on climate change.
\
Mohawk, which sells a range of writing and printing papers, promotes itself as a leader in environmental stewardship. The company offsets all of its electricity with wind power renewable energy credits, offers Green Seal-certified recycled papers, and produces paper certified as using forest resources responsibly.
\
Last month, Nike, one of the founders of a business coalition whose goal is to ""pass meaningful energy and climate change legislation,"" resigned from the chamber's board of directors to protest its stance. But Nike said it remains a member so it can work from within to promote climate change legislation.
\
The chairman of Exelon, the country's largest utility, says reducing carbon emissions through a cap-and-trade approach is the least expensive way to address global warming while sustaining an economic recovery. Speaking at a climate conference last week, CEO John Rowe said options like new nuclear plants, wind and solar cost much more than commonplace solutions like energy efficiency.
\
Criticism of the chamber's stance on climate change took an odd turn Monday when a group of pranksters called the Yes Men held a fake news conference, posing as chamber representatives at the National Press Club in Washington. They announced that the chamber had reversed its position on climate change and would stop lobbying against the Senate's 800-page climate bill.
\
In a statement denouncing the hoax, the chamber said it ""believes that strong climate legislation is compatible with the goals of improving our economy and creating jobs.""

23,"WASHINGTON * When it comes to climate science, two of the three Democratic presidential candidates are A students, while most of the Republican contenders are flunking, according to a panel of scientists who reviewed candidates' comments.\At the request of The Associated Press, eight climate and biological scientists graded for scientific accuracy what a dozen top candidates said in debates, interviews and tweets, using a 0 to 100 scale.\To try to eliminate any bias, the candidates' comments were stripped of names and given randomly generated numbers, so the professors would not know who made each statement they were grading. Also, the scientists who did the grading were chosen by professional scientific societies.\Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had the highest average score at 94. Three scientists did not assign former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley a score, saying most of his statements were about policy, which they could not grade, instead of checkable science.\Two used similar reasoning to skip grading New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and one did the same for businesswoman Carly Fiorina. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas had the lowest score, an average of 6. All eight put Cruz at the bottom of the class.\""This individual understands less about science (and climate change) than the average kindergartner,"" Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University meteorology professor, wrote of Cruz's statements. ""That sort of ignorance would be dangerous in a doorman, let alone a president.""\Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, with an 87, had the lowest score among the Democrats, dinged for an exaggeration when he said global warming could make Earth uninhabitable.\Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush scored the highest among Republicans, 64, but one grader gave him a perfect 100. Bush was the only Republican candidate who got a passing grade on climate in the exercise.\Below Clinton's 94 were O'Malley with 91; Sanders, 87; Bush, 64; Christie, 54; Ohio Gov. John Kasich, 47; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, 38; Fiorina, 28; Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, 21; businessman Donald Trump, 15; retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, 13; and Cruz with 6.\For the Republicans, climate change came up more in interviews than in their four debates. But Rubio did confront the issue in the Sept. 16 debate in a way that earned him bad grades from some scientists.\""We are not going to make America a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing, nothing, to change our climate, to change our weather, because America is a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, absolutely,"" Rubio said. ""But America is not a planet. And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore. China is. And they're drilling a hole and digging anywhere in the world that they can get ahold of.""\Scientists dispute Rubio's argument that because China is now the top emitter, the U.S. can do little to change the future climate. The U.S. spews about 17 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, ""so big cuts here would still make a big difference globally,"" said geochemist Louisa Bradtmiller at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn.. Rubio's inference that China is not doing much about global warming ""is out of date. The Chinese are implementing a cap-and-trade system in their country to reduce emissions,"" said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University.\At an event in August in California's Orange County, Cruz told an interviewer, ""If you look at satellite data for the last 18 years, there's been zero warming. ... The satellite says it ain't happening.""\Florida State University's James Elsner said ground data show every decade has been warmer than the last since the middle of the 20th century and satellite data-based observations ""show continued warming over the past several decades.""\In fact, federal ground-based data, which scientists said is more reliable than satellites, show that 15 of the 17 years after 1997 have been warmer than 1997 and 2015 is on track to top 2014 as the warmest year on record.\Scientists singled out Sanders for overstatement in the first Democratic presidential debate.\""The scientific community is telling us that if we do not address the global crisis of climate change, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy, the planet that we're going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be habitable,"" Sanders said.\Dessler said, ""I would not say that the planet will become uninhabitable. Regardless of what we do, some humans will survive."" Harvard's Jim McCarthy also called the comment an overstatement, as did other scientists when Sanders said it. Recent research on the worst heat projections in the hottest area, the Persian Gulf, finds that toward the end of the century there will be a few days each decade or so when humans cannot survive outside, but can live with air conditioning indoors.\Trump brought out some of the more colorful and terse critiques.\""It could be warming and it's going to start to cool at some point,"" Trump said in a September radio interview. ""And you know in the 1920s people talked about global cooling. I don't know if you know that or not. They thought the Earth was cooling. Now it's global warming.""\Credit: SETH BORENSTEIN; Associated Press"
24,"OUR VIEW | CLIMATE CHANGE OPINION\ Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., is nothing if not dogmatic. Trouble is, his dogma won't hunt any more.\ With the single-mindedness of a true believer, Mr. Inhofe argued for years that global climate change is a ""hoax."" Even as evidence accumulated and the scientific consensus hardened, he used his position as chairman of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to block emission limits on greenhouse gases.\ But as of last week, Mr. Inhofe, as set in his beliefs as ever, no longer is in a position to block efforts to make the United States take responsibility for and action to reduce its contribution to global warming, as many other countries have proposed. He was replaced as chairman of that influential committee by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. Ms. Boxer said in December that her goal is to impose the nation's first mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions.\ Those limits are necessary - and unavoidable - if we hope to diminish the role our conspicuous energy consumption plays in global climate change. Executives in the energy, automotive, paper and other industries have been anticipating such limits for years.\ But whether mandatory carbon dioxide emissions limits are put in place this year or next, Ms. Boxer must help change the environmental focus in Washington from dogged denial to determined action.\ It's long overdue. When he took office in 2001, President George W. Bush rejected the so-called Kyoto Protocol, as did former President Bill Clinton. The Kyoto Protocol was an agreement made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1997. More than 160 countries around the world - including all the countries belonging to the European Union at that time - agreed either to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases, or adopt a ""cap and trade"" emissions-trading system if they failed to cut their emissions. The United States would have had to cut its emissions by 7 percent below its baseline 1990 emissions by 2012. Like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush said the program was too expensive and could cripple U.S. industry and trade.\ There's no question that it will cost money to reduce emissions that contribute to global warming. But as an influential British government report last year warned, failing to act will be even more expensive. The report concluded global climate change could produce a new Great Depression, with sustained disruptions in weather patterns producing floods, drought, famine and economically destabilizing population shifts.\ European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso will visit the White House this week to seek American involvement in a new climate change agreement. It calls for a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 on the part of all developed countries.\ Mr. Bush won't be an easy sell; he and his administration repeatedly have flaunted their obstinacy and ignorance of science. The new Democratically controlled Congress should seize this opportunity to set realistic, scientifically enlightened public policy.\ International efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will produce enormous economic opportunities for American businesses, a fact seemingly lost on obstructionists. Companies like General Electric not only have pledged to cut their emissions, but also have leaped into the market for new technologies that will make such reductions possible and feasible.\ There's much Congress can do to help those companies succeed, and to reduce the nearly unrelenting rush to environmental degradation. Congress can, and should, cap carbon dioxide emissions by empowering the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases as it does other pollutants. It should require higher fuel economy standards for new cars and trucks. It can expand tax credits for alternative fuel sources such as solar and wind power. It can relax sugar import tariffs to permit the production of highly energy efficient ethanol made from cheap sugar cane, a major source of fuel in new cars manufactured in Brazil. And it can fund a ""Manhattan Project"" to develop alternate energy sources.\ A new day finally may have dawned on the global climate change debate in America. We've heard enough from Flat Earth Society members, especially Mr. Inhofe. It's time to start talking about what we will do - right now - to make a difference."

JEFFERSON CITY - In Antarctica, ice is melting at three times the rate it was 10 years ago. Scientists have documented permafrost thawing in Alaska, which could send more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Storms are packing a bigger punch around the world, scientists say, with warming oceans and air creating ideal conditions for devastating downpours.\In Missouri, the EPA has predicted more flooding and more extremely hot days this century because of climate change.\But in the state's U.S. Senate race, neither incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, nor her Republican challenger, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, has emphasized combating climate change. Polling indicates that the issue is not top of mind with voters, either.\The Post-Dispatch asked both McCaskill and Hawley how they would address climate change.\Hawley's campaign sent a three-sentence statement that does not include the words ""climate change"" and pivots to attacking McCaskill after the first sentence.\""Yes, we need to be good stewards of the environment without killing jobs for working families in our state,"" Hawley said, adding that McCaskill sides with ""radical environmentalists every time."" He said McCaskill supported President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan and Waters of the U.S. regulation, though, in fact, McCaskill voted to scrap the clean water rule in 2015.\McCaskill also called for adjustments to the Clean Power Plan in 2014 to ""protect consumers,"" but said last year that President Donald Trump's criticism of the regulation was misguided.\""She represents the environmentalist left-wing and Chuck Schumer, and not the people of Missouri,"" Hawley said.\McCaskill, who has earned a lifetime score of 74 percent with the League of Conservation Voters, provided a longer statement.\""Climate Change is real, the science is overwhelming, and it poses a massive threat to our future. That is why I have fought for renewable fuels and clean energy alternatives,"" McCaskill said, adding she opposed cap and trade because she could not ""saddle Missourians on fixed incomes with sky high utility bills."" Missouri generates about 80 percent of its electricity from coal.\""At the same time, I oppose this administration's efforts to take a massive step backward with abandoning fuel efficiency standards and doing everything possible to help the profits of big oil companies,"" McCaskill added.\Still, environmental groups have criticized her support for the Keystone XL pipeline and opposition to so-called cap-and-trade legislation.\ROLLING BACK REGULATIONS\Trump's administration has unwound numerous climate actions dating to Obama's administration.\In June 2017, Trump removed the United States from the Paris climate agreement, a landmark accord that seeks to limit global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels this century.\The Trump administration has announced plans to scrap planned fuel efficiency standards for automobiles, and in August announced a replacement to Obama's Clean Power Plan, which environmental advocates decried.\In attempting to undo fuel efficiency standards, the Trump administration said in an August environmental impact statement that the planet is predicted to warm 7 degrees Fahrenheit (about 4 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century assuming humans don't change course. Given that, the administration argued the new standards would do little to slow warming.\As attorney general, Hawley has kept Missouri in a lawsuit challenging the Clean Power Plan. Hawley also dissolved the agriculture and environment division in the attorney general's office to ""improve efficiency,"" his office told the Post-Dispatch.\Though Trump made waves with each attempt to roll back environmental protections, polling indicates that voters are focused on other issues.\According to a Sept. 19 nationwide Reuters/Ipsos poll, just 5 percent of likely voters surveyed said ""the environment"" was the most important issue the country faces; health care, immigration and the economy were the top three concerns.\A May Pew Research Center survey showed that the farther away respondents lived from coastal areas, the less likely they were to say climate change affected their communities. Even so, a May Gallup poll showed that a majority of all Americans worry a ""great deal/fair amount"" about climate change, with 70 percent of adults under 35 voicing concern, more than older age groups.\Hawley, in attempting to tie McCaskill to ""radical environmentalists,"" may be on the right side of public opinion in Missouri, a conservative state. At the same time, McCaskill has positioned herself as a middle-of-the-road legislator on environmental issues, drawing criticism from environmentalists and policy wonks.\Still, John Hickey, president of the Missouri chapter of the Sierra Club, which supports more regulations to rein in greenhouse gas emissions, said he prefers McCaskill over Hawley.\""We have done our homework, and we do see that the candidates differ very strongly on the environment,"" Hickey said. ""Josh Hawley is no friend to clean air and clean water.""\The Sierra Club has not endorsed McCaskill, however. Hickey did praise McCaskill's ""no"" vote to confirm Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator. ""When there's been this concerted attack on bedrock environmental laws, she's been there,"" he said.\McCaskill's 74 percent score with the League of Conservation Voters is higher than the score for Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who has a lifetime score of 5 percent. The group advocates for ""sound environmental laws and policies,"" including ""advancing the climate agenda launched by President Obama.""\Maxine Lipeles, director of the Interdisciplinary Environmental Clinic at Washington University, took issue with McCaskill's opposition to cap-and-trade legislation, but acknowledged there would likely be a cost associated with a transition to renewable energy.\She said that renewable energy keeps getting cheaper, and that cap-and-trade encourages a more aggressive transition to renewable energy. In such a system, the government sets a pollution limit, or ""cap,"" and companies sell, or ""trade,"" emissions allowances to other companies that pollute more.\Kathleen Henry, president of the St. Louis-based Great Rivers Environmental Law Center, said McCaskill's record leaves a lot to be desired.\""I don't think she has (acknowledged climate change's severity) when she opposed cap-and-trade and supports Keystone. Both of those are actions that deny the reality of climate change,"" Henry said. ""I wish both candidates would acknowledge the reality of climate change and the threat it poses to Missouri and all of humanity.""\Lipeles said it isn't helpful that the issue of climate change has become politically charged.\""When you talk about specific issues, I think there is pretty strong public support,"" Lipeles said. ""But if you talk about regulations or environmental protection, then people start getting more polarized in a less productive way.""\CREDIT: By Jack Suntrup, St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
26," St. Louis: A great home for music\ Your New Year's Day editorial recounts the memorable events of 1804 and 1904 in St. Louis' history and exhorts us toward visionary thinking for the city's future. On the cultural side, visions were already realized to give us two new museums for the arts in Grand Center. Yet further strides in the arts could be made here if all citizens were to become aware they reside in one of America's major homes to music, on a par with the city's recognition as a citadel for baseball and the Cardinals.\ The musical environment of St. Louis enters 2004 on a brightened path with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra's recent selection of its new music director. Great thanks to David Robertson, the vibrant young American conductor, for choosing to make Powell Hall and St. Louis his professional home, and gratitude to all those whose planning and financial support made this exciting selection possible. Deep appreciation also to those in the community whose gifts, large and small, continue to bring stabilization to this our city's most recognized cultural institution and the second oldest professional orchestra in the country.\ But this is only part of the picture. St. Louis should build the proposed Blues Museum on Laclede's Landing in recognition of the area's contributions to this musical genre. Ragtime and jazz, with their deep roots at the banks of the Mississippi, deserve equal treatment and status. And St. Louis, through the creativity of local giants, should be touted as a birthplace of rock 'n' roll and an impetus to this earth-changing art form.\ Opera Theatre of St. Louis' star continues to rise nationally and beyond, giving seed to an exciting, expanding operatic scene for the city. And for almost a century The Muny, the nation's largest outdoor theater, has built a legacy of enriching this part of the country with Broadway musicals enjoyed on a grand scale.\ In a word, much energy is given in this city to promote live performances and proper places for a broad variety of musical expressions, while institutions try to preserve and tout an esteemed history and its traditions.\ If we consider that Cleveland's image is immediately associated with its Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, as well as its fine orchestra, our city's even richer musical history and extensive music-making should be properly promoted nationally and worldwide. Our music is deservedly equal to that of the Cardinals and the Gateway Arch.\ Sue Taylor\ Clayton\ ===\ Get it right, Get Out\ With family visiting from Georgia (two adults; four children, ages 3-12 ) plus ourselves (Grandma and Grandpa), we were looking for something to do on New Year's Eve that didn't involve the commitment and chaos of the '04 Eve in Forest Park.\ We were very excited about the prospect of seeing the Winter Wonderland lights in Tilles County Park, loaded the entire crew in our vehicles and caravaned from St. Peters to Litzsinger and McKnight -- only to find Winter Wonderland closed and dark at 7:30 p.m.\ The article in Get Out was titled ""Events -- Seasonal, Wednesday, Dec. 31,"" and said the Winter Wonderland hours were 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. through Sunday.\ When we got back home with a herd of very disappointed children and adults, I called the park's phone number, and there was the disclaimer about being closed on New Year's Eve.\ May I suggest in the future, instead of stating ""Call for more information,"" your phrasing should be, ""Call for correct information""? Or even better, wouldn't it be nice to have the correct information in the Post-Dispatch to start with?\ Henry and Betty Spitzmiller\ St. Peters\ ===\ Coverage ignores Kucinich\ While I was pleased to see Jon Sawyer's recent article on the failures of NAFTA to live up to its expectations, my disappointment quickly grew as I read the portion of the article under the heading ""Democrats weigh in.""\ It looks as though you are continuing an inadvertent trend of biased media coverage by neglecting to mention the candidate who is perhaps most opposed to this agreement, Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich, D- Ohio. In fact, one of the first actions by a Kucinich administration would be to withdraw the United States from NAFTA and the World Trade Organization, replacing them with fair-trade agreements.\ While Kucinich has acknowledged that membership in this agreement and organization has strengthened large multinational corporations, he has also recognized that these corporate gains come at the expense of the workers, family farmers, and the environment. Kucinich believes that workers' rights, human rights, and environmental principles must be the guiding principles behind international trade treaties.\ Warren Popp\ Town and Country\ ===\ Bush emissions plan\ will work better, faster\ Everyone agrees that reductions in mercury emissions at power plants are important. Unfortunately, your editorial last month was incorrect in stating that the Environmental Protection Agency seemed poised to order a 90 percent cutback in mercury. The 1990 Clean Air Act makes no such assumption and in fact, the EPA has never regulated mercury emissions from power plants and no state is currently reducing mercury by 90 percent.\ After eight years of failure to act, the Clinton administration's EPA, in December 2000 -- just prior to leaving office -- entered a settlement agreement with environmental groups that required the EPA to propose a mercury rule by 2003. Nothing in the agreement says what mercury levels should be.\ To the contrary, the Bush plan will not only regulate mercury for the first time ever, it will reduce mercury emissions by 70 percent or more through the well-developed ""cap and trade"" approach. That ""cap and trade"" approach has produced faster, less expensive and deeper reductions with other pollutants and will work with mercury as well. This market-based approach to reducing emissions will avoid the costly litigation that slows reductions and increases costs of compliance.\ The Bush EPA's plan to reduce mercury emissions will work better and faster, and our communities with better off because of it.\ Frank Maisano\ Electric Reliability\ Coordinating Council\ Washington\ ===\ Reasons for ignorance\ In his Dec. 31 column, Jonah Goldberg comes down rather hard on the ignorance of the electorate. At one point, Mr. Goldberg says, ""One in two [Americans] don't know who their congressman is.""\ I beg to differ with Mr. Goldberg as to why these people may not know who their congressman is. For example, I have lived in in Rock Hill now for more than 13 years. During that time, I have been in three different congressional districts. No, I did not move during this entire time.\ However, after the 1990 and 2000 censuses, the congressional borders were shifted. I started out in the Second Congressional District but was shifted to the First Congresssional District after the 1990 Census. After the 2000 Census, I was shifted to the Third Congressional District. I had no voice in these changes. They were dictated by back-room party hacks along with Dick Gephardt, Bill Clay and William Lacy Clay. The main purpose of these shifts was self-perpetuation on the part of Mr. Gephardt and the Clays.\ There is a fairly large number of minority voters living in this area. They almost always vote Democratic. Basically, Messrs. Gephardt and the Clays were fighting over these ""sure thing"" votes. This occurred in spite of the fact that the Clays had a huge block of votes north of Delmar Boulevard and east of Keinlin Avenue who will blindly vote for them. Mr. Gephardt's future was all but guaranteed in Congress as long as Bill Federer was the best that the Republican Party could come up with to run against him.\ Meanwhile, someone like me gets stuck in the middle of all this with no voice whatsoever. So if someone in my area does not know who his or her congressman is, it is probably because of the scenario outlined above. I might add that the shifting of borders backfired because it put more Republicans into the Second District, which helped force Democrat Joan Kelly Horn out of office.\ In conclusion, maybe if back-room party hacks and congressmen would not treat the electorate like political pingpong balls, the electorate might be more involved in the political process and less ignorant.\ Bill Heger\ Rock Hill"
27,"Editor's note: Three area professors recently met with the News-Leader editorial board to stress their common view that climate change creates economic and biological dangers. We decided to pass some of their questions to area lawmakers on the federal level, and the lawmakers have chosen to answer for publication three questions each.\Today is the first installment.\Questions were drafted by biology professors Alexander Wait, Ph.D., Missouri State University; and Wendy Anderson, Ph.D., Drury University; and economics associate professor Terrel Gallaway, Ph.D., MSU.\If you have a question on this subject you would like us to pass to the lawmakers, e-mail Editorial Page Editor Dave Iseman, diseman@news-leader.com.\Question: The scientific evidence that human activities do and will contribute significantly to changes in climate (including overall global warming) is vast and well substantiated. It is analogous to the evidence linking smoking and lung cancer, as are the efforts to discredit that evidence. Do you think that we will look back on today's climate change skepticism like we look back on tobacco-cancer skepticism, and regret that we did not act more quickly and aggressively to curtail such a serious threat?\U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt said: The country is engaged in a legitimate debate about where our energy is going to come from, how it's going to be produced, and how it's going to be paid for and taxed. These issues affect every single American worker and consumer. Nobody wants to depend on foreign oil or unnecessarily pollute the environment, so we need a strategy to transition away from those kinds of energy. But Washington Democrats and Robin Carnahan are pushing a job-killing cap and trade national energy tax plan that will cost our economy hundreds of billions of dollars, nearly double the cost of our utility bills and kill more than 32,000 jobs in Missouri in the first year alone according to the Heritage Foundation.\One clear scientific fact is that nuclear power is one of the safest and cleanest forms of energy production in the world. Our country needs to be on the path to energy independence, and responsible people in the scientific community know that nuclear energy has to be a big part of that. Scientific evidence also is clear that wind turbines or solar panels or even natural gas alone aren't going to meet all of our energy needs. We need realistic comprehensive energy solutions.\America is a lot of things but it is not a planet. Whether you agree with the scientific evidence about greenhouse gases or not, the Washington Democrats cap and trade plan will shift the production of jobs to developing countries that don't care as much about the environment as we do. I'm for more American energy of all kinds including wind, solar, natural gas, nuclear, oil, coal and alternative fuels and next-generation energy technologies. Let's get real about our energy independence and promote more American-made energy.\U.S. Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond said: My constituents will look back and be glad I didn't force them into hundreds of billions of dollars in new job-killing energy taxes for legislation that scientists tell us would have almost no measurable effect on world temperatures.\Instead, I have - and will continue - to push for increased investment in clean, American, affordable energy that protects jobs and family budgets. I'm proud to have supported Missouri as our state leads the way in alternative energy, from corn and soybeans to new cellulosic fuels from biomass and algae. Also, I've helped Missouri become a center of new battery technology and am working to make our state a leader in creating affordable and reliable technology to utilize coal without emitting carbon - particularly key to coal-dependent states like ours. I am especially proud of the carbon sequestration project I have supported at City Utilities' coal fired plant. We should also nuclear energy and pursue wind and solar where it makes economic sense.\Congress has the opportunity to promote cleaner, affordable, home-grown American energy that will result in lower carbon emissions and a cleaner environment. Unfortunately, many remain preoccupied with energy tax-raising and job-killing cap-and-trade bills to address climate change - despite scientific agreement that without India and China these proposals won't have an impact. Until we can come together to push solutions where we agree, both the American people and the environment will suffer.\U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill said: Climate change is a serious issue, and as I have said repeatedly I don't believe that Congress should kick the can down the road on hard issues just because elections are coming up.\However, at the same time, it is clear that we are still dealing with a tough economy and it would be a mistake to increase the economic burden on Missouri's families and small businesses at this point. So as Congress moves forward on energy legislation, I will be looking at how we can transition to a low-carbon economy."
28,"WASHINGTON -- Missouri would have to significantly reduce its carbon emissions over the next 16 years under a proposal the Obama administration unveiled Monday to combat global warming.\The proposal could force Missouri's coal-fired power plants to dramatically change the way they operate -- for example, by improving efficiency, switching to natural gas or even closing.\The draft environmental rule, a top domestic goal of the administration, is the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's climate change initiative. Power plants are the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., generating about 38 percent of heat-trapping gases.\Under the proposal, Missouri would have to achieve a 21 percent reduction in carbon emissions per megawatt hour of electricity by 2030. Environmentalists in Missouri said the plan would improve the environment and public health, while business groups said it would hurt the economy.\No one disputed the outsized impact of the proposal on the Show-Me State.\Missouri's power plants produce more carbon dioxide than facilities in all but seven other states. That's because Missouri generates 83 percent of its energy from its 24 coal-fired plants.\EPA officials said Missouri's plants produced 1,963 pounds of carbon pollution per megawatt hour of electricity in 2012. The EPA wants that brought down to 1,544 pounds by 2030.\The EPA said it took into account each state's energy mix before setting state-specific goals.\""We don't have to choose between a healthy economy and a healthy environment,"" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said. ""Our action will sharpen America's competitive edge, spur innovation and create jobs.""\The Missouri Chamber of Commerce is part of a national coalition of business interests, the Partnership for a Better Energy Future, trying to stop the proposed regulations.\Also opposed is Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. On Monday he said, ""I will fight the president and his administration every step of the way to stop this unprecedented power grab and protect Missourians, who rely on coal for 80 percent of our state's energy.""\A spokesman for the energy partnership, Chad Kolton, said: ""The proposed emissions targets cannot realistically be met without forcing substantial closures of existing plants and taking major energy options off the table in the U.S. ... The resulting impacts on American jobs and the economy could be devastating.""\Gov. Jay Nixon said in a statement that his administration would review the proposal ""with a particular focus on making sure these proposed rules provide the flexibility Missouri needs to ensure consumers and businesses have access to reliable, affordable and sustainable energy from a diverse portfolio of sources now and in the future.""\Environmental groups in Missouri and across the country cheered the proposal and said the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions outweigh the costs.\""It'll be easier to meet the targets than to do nothing and deal with the droughts, severe weather, reduced food production and expensive disasters"" that will result from climate change, said John Hickey, director of the Missouri chapter of the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group. ""We need to take action if we're going to have a Midwest that our children can live in.""\A federal advisory committee said in a report released last month that global warming is already damaging every region of the country and problems will increase. Effects in the Midwest include more intense heat waves, more humidity and worse air quality. More extreme rainfalls will cause erosion and affect water quality, according to the National Climate Assessment report.\The report said climate change will bring longer growing seasons that will increase the yields of some crops. But those benefits will be largely offset by extreme weather, causing agriculture production to decrease in the long term.\The EPA plan does not seek to mandate specific emissions levels for each power plant to meet; instead, the proposed rule would give states until June 2016 to decide how to cut pollution.\Besides adopting new technologies or increasing energy efficiencies, states could also buy emissions credits similar to the cap-and-trade system now being used by nine states in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic regions.\Supporters of national rules on power plant emissions argue that states like Missouri that have lagged other states in addressing greenhouse gases still have some of the easier steps at their disposal.\""Some states that have been overly reliant on coal will likely diversify to a wider range of cleaner energy resources and they'll have time to come up with a plan and do that,"" said Dan Bakal, director of electric power at Ceres, a sustainability advocacy group.\Missouri is among the 30 states that currently require utilities to generate a certain share of power from renewable sources. But that has not produced strong results so far.\Only 1 percent of the electricity generated in Missouri came from renewable sources in 2012, according to data from the EPA.\""We've got wind energy potential in Missouri. We've got solar energy potential in Missouri,"" said the Sierra Club's Hickey.\He also noted that Missouri ranks 43rd among states in energy efficiency, according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.\""So there's a lot of energy efficiency to capture,"" he said, ""and that's one of the ways ... we can meet the new standards.""\He and others argued that innovation in those two areas -- renewable energy and energy efficiency -- could create new jobs and spur economic development.\The Obama administration is taking executive action now because Congress killed a cap-and-trade bill in 2009. The White House is backed by a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, as it does other pollutants, if it determines they're a threat to public health and welfare.\The EPA did that in 2009. Since then, it has limited carbon pollution from new vehicles by increasing fuel efficiency requirements. And it is in the process of finalizing emissions rules for future power plants. Those rules would essentially prevent the building of new coal-fired power plants unless they use carbon capture and storage, a technology still in its infancy.\The EPA is taking a more flexible approach for the nation's existing power plants. But the rules are still likely to be challenged in Congress and in court.\The EPA is expected to finalize the rules next June, after it takes public comments and makes any revisions.\Even if the rules are enacted, critics say the emissions reductions will have little effect on global carbon pollution. Supporters say other countries -- particularly China, the top emitter -- are waiting to see what the United States does before taking action.\Polls show that Americans favor restricting carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, but global warming has not ranked high on the issues the public wants Washington to address."

In August 1988, amid a tough presidential election campaign, one candidate said in a speech, ""Those who think we're powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect are forgetting about the White House effect."" Some might be surprised to learn that the speaker wasn't the Democratic candidate, it was then-Vice President George H.W. Bush.\As the nation mourns the former president's death Friday at age 94, his legacy as a Republican environmentalist who put in place fundamental protections against air pollution and climate change should be at the top of the list of his accomplishments.\It is difficult to understate the importance to the nation's health and welfare of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, and Bush played a pivotal role in their passage. The legislation was hopelessly mired in Congress until Bush used presidential muscle to break a logjam and get it passed. The updating of the 1970 law remains the most sweeping and comprehensive environmental statute on the books. It created the first ""cap and trade"" program, which ultimately ended the industrial air pollution causing ""acid rain"" that had blighted large parts of the country. The program's use of market mechanisms provides a blueprint for controlling all air pollution that contributes to global warming.\The law also paved the way for the requirement for cleaner-running cars and clean fuels that have radically reduced pollution from smog in the United States. And it provided the government with the ability to control 189 toxic substances that had poisoned the air and to require permits from individual sources of pollution. Citizens were empowered to bring lawsuits seeking penalties against violators to ensure the law's enforcement.\In the decades since Bush championed the law's passage, its effects on the nation's health and productivity have been profound. According to a 2011 Environmental Protection Agency study, in its first 20 years, the law had the effect of reducing premature deaths by 160,000, heart attacks by 130,000 and hospital admissions by 86,000. In the process, it resulted in 13 million fewer lost workdays. Children were healthier, too: The reduction of respiratory illnesses and other diseases related to air pollution meant 3.2 million school days were not lost. The EPA estimates the overall economic benefits of the law at $2 trillion.\It is hard to imagine a law that has done more to boost America's health, safety, productivity and prosperity.\But Bush's environmental bona fides extended far beyond the domestic provisions of the Clear Air Act. He pushed for U.S. leadership on a global scale, as vice president and president, to address the mounting threat from the ""ozone hole,"" caused by certain chemicals released into the atmosphere that thinned the ozone functioning as a shield protecting the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. The international Montreal Protocol, signed by the United States in 1987, required the EPA to ban the use of ozone-harming chemicals that had been commonly found in air-conditioning refrigerants and spray cans. This year came the fantastic news that scientists had confirmed for the first time that the ozone hole is beginning to close.\On climate change, Bush showed White House leadership even before the world had begun to experience its disastrous effects. Understanding the potential threat from the greenhouse effect, as it was then called, Bush instituted in 1989 by executive action the Global Change Research Program. The program pulled together the entire federal government's expertise on climate change; you might have heard about its most recent newsmaking report, issued the day after Thanksgiving, with alarming warnings about the need for more robust efforts to fight climate change. The report also provided a road map for progress by tracking positive actions taken by state and local governments and businesses.\Bush's environmental record did have some notable blemishes. He proposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and officials in his administration undermined the initial implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments. In his 1992 re-election bid, Bush even mocked vice presidential candidate Al Gore as ""Ozone Man."" But his trash talking on the trail in a losing campaign shouldn't outweigh Bush's environmental achievements. As we honor his life and service, let's remember that we can all breathe easier because he was our president.\> Monica Medina was the principal deputy undersecretary at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under President Barack Obama and now publishes Our Daily Planet, an independent environmental newsletter.\CREDIT: By Monica Medina"
30,"Members of the Midwestern Governors Association, including Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, approved a pair of landmark agreements last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage renewable power sources.\The move attracted considerable attention. California's Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger lauded the agreement, which he said could help pave the way for a national policy to reduce emissions. Western and Northeastern states have endorsed regional pacts.\Of the 12 Midwestern states in the group, only one didn't even bother to send a representative to take part in the discussions: Missouri. That's as shortsighted as it is disappointing. Our failure to anticipate evolving challenges in energy use and production could harm the state's economy - to say nothing of the longer term damage it could inflict on the environment.\Curbing the release of heat-trapping carbon dioxide and ramping up the development of alternative fuels are vital to the region's future. The Midwestern governors' agreements encourage states to offset growing energy demand by increasing efficiency; to expand use of renewable power sources such as solar or wind; and to establish a regional cap-and-trade system to trade emission credits.\No state could benefit more from those policies than Missouri. A report released last week showed that our state led the Midwest in the rate of increase of greenhouse gas emissions. Between 1990 and 2003, releases of heat-trapping gas here grew twice as fast as the state's population.\Coal-fired power plants, many of which are decades old, account for the biggest share of greenhouse gas emissions in Missouri. With mounting evidence of the harm caused by greenhouse gas emissions, the federal government eventually will enact emissions caps, if not next year then after the 2008 elections. \A bill already introduced in the U.S. Senate would impose a cap-and-trade system similar to that contained in the Midwestern governors' agreement. If it passes, it would have a significant impact on states, including Missouri, that have not yet acted to rein-in emissions and encourage alternatives.\A spokeswoman for Gov. Matt Blunt said he is ""actively studying and reviewing"" the agreements but expressed concern that ""it could have serious implications on the state's energy supply and the cost of electricity.""\So will the attempt to coast on the status quo, which is unsustainable. The Midwestern Governors Association collectively decided that the benefits of early action outweigh the risks, and clearly they do.\""Our strong manufacturing base and rich agricultural industries, along with the wealth of resources in our vast northern forests and our world-leading research universities, position the Midwest to become the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy,"" explained Gov. Jim Doyle of Wisconsin.\It's important - economically as well as environmentally - that Missouri share in that future instead of standing on the sidelines and watching the rest of the Midwest pass it by."
31,"Corn is the nation's most abundant, lucrative field crop and in recent years has hit record production and yield figures. Government mandates that require certain percentages of corn-based ethanol to be blended into gasoline have created more demand for corn, delivering corn farmers their only growing market, while complicating the country's - and the world's - energy and food picture.\As leaders from around the world debate energy and environment issues at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, representatives from this country's largest corn lobby group, the Chesterfield-based National Corn Growers Association, are there to observe.\And, as national and global climate change-related initiatives are considered, corn growers are at the center of the conversation. Rick Tolman, head of the group, is one of their most important voices.\Why was this year such a challenge for corn growers?\This was probably, in most ways, the worst year in history for the current generation of corn producers. We had a really late spring planting, under adverse conditions. Then the summer was fairly good, but then we had that heavy rain period in September and October.\We were on track to have an all-time record crop and yield. But the corn crop needs a certain amount of heat, of sunshine days, to mature, and that just didn't occur. The other thing is moisture is very high ... which means (the corn) has to go through artificial drying, which is costly and causes a bottleneck.\How will farmers emerge from this delayed harvest?\We'll probably hit a second-high harvest. We're estimating around 164 (bushels) per acre. There's a good-news and bad-news story. When we were having an anticipated high crop, prices started to drop to about $2 per bushel. The price is running about $3.60 now. That's helped offset some of the higher expenses. Most farmers will probably make some money.\What do you hope comes out of Copenhagen?\The farming community in general has a lot of trepidation about what's going on - we're concerned about climate change, but some of the ideas and proposals would have significant impact on the cost of farming.\Our guys are over there to monitor that and explain what's going on with modern farming. One example: The vast majority of row crops are grown under reduced tillage. One of the proposals is to give credit for reduced tillage and carbon sequestration.\The dilemma is, most of the farmers who can do that have already done it, and those who can't, can't because of climatic conditions. To propose it will have disadvantages to those farmers.\Why are corn growers concerned about cap-and-trade? (Legislation allowing polluters to buy pollution credits from lesser polluters in order to achieve emissions goals that is being debated by the U.S. Senate. It passed the House of Representatives in the summer.) The USDA recently, in testimony to Congress ... concluded that there could be as much as 36 million acres in farmland in the Midwest planted to trees if the cap-and-trade bill passed as it is now, because there are significant incentives for forestation.\How are we going to feed the world if we take 36 million acres out of production and put it into forest? We need to increase productivity in the high-yielding areas of the world - like the Midwest - and decrease productivity in areas that aren't.\How is the recent completion of the sequencing of the corn genome going to help farmers?\They're already benefiting. The sequencing was an ongoing project - there were little pieces of information coming out over the last few years, and it's helped with marker-assisted breeding. ... Under the old breeding system, if you had a trait controlled by 10 genes, you'd have a 1 in 1 trillion chance of finding the combination you wanted.\With marker-assisted breeding, you have a 1 in 5 chance. It's amazing what this has meant for breeding. We have a real opportunity to accelerate our genetic potential. ... We have a map now. We know where the pieces are.\---\Rick Tolman CEO, National Corn Growers Association\Age 58\Education B.S., agricultural economics, Brigham Young University; M.S., agricultural economics, Purdue University\Previous occupation Executive director, U.S. Grains Council; marketing planning manager, International Harvester; market research manager, GEHL\Personal Lives in Ballwin, married with five children\Credit: GEORGINA GUSTIN ggustin@post-dispatchcom > 314-340-8195"

Don't tell Missourians about taking care of Mother Earth. They've long been stewards of the land, Sen. Kit Bond believes.
\
But the Missouri senior senator says his constituents don't support climate-change laws that strangle the American economy, weigh them down with red tape and lighten their wallets.
\
""We've always supported responsible measures to clean up the environment,"" Mr. Bond said Wednesday during a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ""(Missourians) want to live with reasonable and responsible regulations, not burdensome mandates.""
\
The hearing focused on the Kerry-Boxer Bill, the so-called cap-and-trade measure that Mr. Bond said could raise Missouri electricity rates 42 percent by 2020.
\
The Republican lawmaker said at the hearing that Americans can cut carbon emissions by turning to nuclear power, hybrid transportation and wind and solar energy in places where they make economic sense. He added that unilateral climate-change action by the United States would do nothing to reduce global temperatures.

Broadband access
\
Congressman Sam Graves did not support legislation the Obama administration advocated for stimulating the American economy. With it approved, however, the Northwest Missouri lawmaker wants the effective application of the spending, particularly when it come to the provision of rural broadband service.
\
Opening a Small Business Committee hearing Wednesday, the panel's top Republican called the $7.2 billion allocated for broadband grants and loan programs a step toward leveling the urban-rural playing field.
\
""The lack of sufficient access and speeds has put a growing number of people at a disadvantage,"" Mr. Graves said, noting that students with broadband have a competitive edge over peers in places without access.
\
With the money in place to spur these programs, Congress should ensure ease in the application process and appropriate rules that don't lead to unintended consequences, the representative said. Further, funding should not go to areas with adequate broadband coverage.
\
""Bureaucratic red tape should not be prohibiting businesses from providing high-speed broadband service to everyone,"" Mr. Graves said.

To help with the city's ongoing stormwater and wastewater projects, the legislation included $500,000 through the Environmental Protection Agency.
\
The measure passed 247 to 178. The St. Joseph expenditure was requested by Mr. Graves, though he voted, like 162 other Republicans, against the spending bill.

According to an estimate of the American Community Survey, the city's Hispanic population in 2008 stood at 2,887.
\
That compares with 1,929 local Hispanics counted in the 2000 census. In 1990, the Hispanic population in the city was 1,586.

33,"In his article against cap-and-trade legislation, ""Cities are trapping most of our carbon,"" Mr. Boyer leads you to believe that he is an authority on the subject of climate change and correct in his views. However, any reader with even a basic understanding of the subject is left to wonder whether Mr. Boyer is very confused or intentionally misleading his audience.\Mr. Boyer spends the first half of his article misunderstanding the difference between carbon sequestration and carbon storage. Basic science time, Mr. Boyer: carbon sequestration involves the removal and storage of carbon from the atmosphere, while carbon storage is anytime carbon is kept in a non-gaseous state. He begins by citing a German study which concludes ""Cities trap more carbon than rain forests""[1]. He goes on to ""salute"" National Geographic for reporting on the study which he thinks ""flies in the face of their advocacy for tropical forest preservation for climate protection."" He says ""the report states that the total carbon sequestered by U.S. cities to be 20 billion tons."" However, that statement is incorrect.\The report actually states that cities store (not sequester) the 20 billion tons. If Mr. Boyer had understood the very basic difference between carbon sequestration and carbon storage, he would have seen that forest preservation is a key element of carbon storage in cities. He probably also wouldn't have suggested that building wood homes is a good way to sequester carbon. Mr. Boyer goes on to assume that environmentalists and scientists are opposed to nuclear energy and because of that their motives are ""highly suspect."" However, many prominent environmentalists and scientists have promoted nuclear power, including the founder of Greenpeace who recently admitted his own misunderstanding of the safety of nuclear technology and emphasized the growing need for carbon neutral power.[2]\In relation to cap-and-trade legislation, nuclear power would greatly benefit from the new laws. With near zero carbon emissions, nuclear power could see much greater profitability and more widespread use. Mr. Boyer then says he believes the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is trying to use cap-and-trade to ""fetter the U.S. economy"" even though every other industrialized nation has already agreed to follow the exact same reductions under the Kyoto protocol.\A push for energy independence will benefit our economy. The arguments against cap-and-trade legislation can seem compelling on the surface, but it's not just a secret tax the polluters want you to believe it is. Cap-and-trade legislation has already been shown to be very successful and effective in the United States. The Clean Air Act put a cap-and-trade system on SO2 emissions, which were responsible for acid rain. The emissions were reduced by 50 percent in the last 27 years, reduced the cost of controlling acid rain, and reduced acid rain itself by 40 percent. [3, 4]. When done properly, the cap-and-trade system uses the power of a capitalist market to guide the economy and environment in the right direction.\[1,2,3,4] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_trading#United_States\Joe Lopez lives in Springfield."

WASHINGTON - The Environmental Protection Agency has officially stopped taking public comments on its proposal to reduce mercury emissions, but that didn't stop environmental groups from calling the proposal weak, too favorable to industry and dangerous for children.
\
The EPA has proposed regulations to reduce mercury emissions by 70 percent by 2018, saying mercury is ""highly toxic"" and most often emitted by coal-fired electric plants.
\
The regulations also include a ""cap and trade"" policy that would set a national limit on mercury emissions by power plants. Power companies with high mercury levels could buy ""emission credits"" from companies that produce less mercury.
\
Most of the American Public Power Association supports the cap and trade policy.
\
""With cap and trade, the nation will see an average of 90 percent reduction but not every individual source will be required to achieve 90 percent reduction,"" said Theresa Pugh, manager of environmental services at the American Public Power Association.
\
But the Sierra Club and other environmental groups, as well as sportsmen's organizations, have condemned the plan. The regulations have drawn about 540,000 comments, the most in the EPA's history, Sierra Club officials said. Forty-five senators and more than 185 representatives have signed on to statements that criticize the EPA's plan.
\
However, U.S. Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond, R-Mo., said that the EPA proposal satisfies Missouri's environmental and financial needs. A more extreme proposal, he said, would force consumers to switch to more expensive natural-gas alternatives.
\
""EPA's proposed standards reduce mercury emissions as much as currently technologically feasible for the coal we burn in Missouri,"" said Mr. Bond in an e-mail interview. ""I will work for clean-air policies that protect both the environment and the family budget.""
\
Nationally, Missouri ranks ninth in mercury emissions. According to the Environmental Working Group, an environmental research and advocacy group, the Lake Road Plant of St. Joseph Light and Power Co., now Aquila, emitted an estimated 24 pounds of mercury in 1998, the most recent year for which the group had data. Almost 580,000 people live within 10 miles of nine mercury-emitting plants in the state.
\
""Our current understanding of total U.S. mercury deposition is that coal plant emissions are a fraction of the total concentration,"" reads a statement by Aquila. ""However, if it's determined by sound science that certain mercury emission levels should be in place, we will meet those standards.""
\
Advocates in the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters and Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy group, said the technology to dramatically reduce mercury emissions is available and already in use. They argued that the EPA should plan to reduce mercury emissions 90 percent by 2008.
\
Phone calls to the EPA were not returned.
\
All of Missouri's rivers and lakes are under a mercury advisory. According to a statement by the state Department of Health and Senior Services, mercury levels in some Missouri fish pose a health threat to children.
\
The agency warns pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, nursing mothers and children 12 years of age and younger to avoid mercury-laden fish, like largemouth bass. Predator fish often have higher mercury levels than smaller fish. Missouri is among the country's top spenders on recreational fishing.
\
""Each year power plants emit almost 3,000 pounds (nationally) of mercury, which rains down and washes into lakes and rivers,"" said Lindsay Bilhorn, citizen outreach director for Missouri PIRG.
\
Critics charged that the plan was written by and for energy companies, saying the power companies want to minimize and delay controls of mercury emissions.
\
The EPA proposal duplicates language from a report written by industry organizations that represent large utility companies, according to Debbie Boger, deputy legislative director for the Sierra Club. This leads to questions about how closely the EPA is deriving its report from industry, she said.
\
""What we are getting is politics, not medicine,"" said Robert Musil, executive director for Physicians for Social Responsibility. ""The science is very clear. There is no doubt about the dangers of mercury.""
\
While the formal public comment period is over, advocates hope that concerned citizens will continue to voice their views. The EPA will be issuing its final mercury emission regulations in March 2005.

35,"
Two University of Missouri profs recently returned from the climate change summit in Copenhagen saying they were disappointed by what they regarded as its lack of progress. The big nations, including the United States, were not willing to agree to a binding plan for seriously reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The professors are believers in what they call ""settled science,"" affirming a pattern of man-made global warming threatening many areas and peoples of the world.
\
Writing Sunday in these pages, the director of the sustainable development program at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund expressed a similar agenda based on an argument intended to appeal to the economic development gene in all of us: Alternative energy is becoming a huge economic niche that the United States is failing to exploit. Most solar panels and wind turbines are being built in other nations.
\
You don't have to be a global warming skeptic, which many people of reasonable intelligence are these days, to question a headlong move into alternative forms of energy as primary sources. What proponents fail to stress is that alternative energy industries and generation are sustained with large public subsidies or plans such as ""cap-and-trade,"" involving big costs to an industrial nation with cheaper sources of coal and oil and natural gas.
\
No matter how appealing to promoters of renewable energy, it simply is unrealistic to expect the United States to impose such costs, which visit on every citizen, not just commercial energy users. The plague of global warming is not as evident as the smog in Los Angeles once was.
\
Subsidies are necessary to launch new technology, and increasing use of renewables is a good thing, but improvements in more efficient sources of energy can be even more effective. If we want to save the environment and fight global warming with public subsidies, we will get much more bang for the buck supporting increased nuclear power generation.
\
The big debate over global warming is not whether it is occurring but how best to react, starting with an honest assessment of likely effects and whether a feasible cure lies in unrealistic expectations limiting the use of fossil fuels. We have made great strides in cleaning the atmosphere and should keep at it. Increasing use of wind, solar, hydro and other clean sources of energy should be encouraged. Expecting these sources to become primary by quelling the use of more efficient fuels is a pipe dream and the wrong place to focus intended climatic fixes.
\
If the Maldives and lower Manhattan are destined to go under water, we won't be able to avert that outcome with a Copenhagen greenhouse gas policy. When and if such threats become real, we'll be obliged to take protective action for the particular problems at hand. Meanwhile, most of us are not yet ready to believe such dire promises warrant the prohibitionist policies being promoted by the most ardent climate worriers.

36," For too long, global warming has matched Mark Twain's description of the weather: Everybody talked about it, but nobody did anything about it. That may be changing. The question is whether it's changing fast enough to keep up with the changes in climate.\ First, the bad news: An Australian researcher reported this week that carbon dioxide emissions have increased much faster than projected. They were 35 percent higher in 2006 than in 1990. Part of the reason may be that warmer oceans have less ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the air than cooler ones.\ Now, the encouraging news: The Kansas Department of Health and Environment did something last week that no other government entity in America ever did before: It blocked the expansion of a large coal- fired power plant on the basis of excessive greenhouse gas emissions.\ That plant, situated in Holcomb, Kan., would have used the same pulverized-coal technology that Peabody Energy Corp. is building into its Prairie State facility some 50 miles southeast of St. Louis.\ Environmentalists have tried unsuccessfully in state and federal court to block construction of the Illinois plant. They've warned that it would degrade air quality in Southwestern Illinois and would be the nation's largest single source of greenhouse gases. The U.S. Court of Appeals denied their case in August.\ Like Illinois, Kansas has no law explicitly limiting carbon dioxide emissions. And like their Illinois colleagues, environmental regulators who assessed the Kansas plant did not take greenhouse gas emissions into consideration when they recommended it be approved.\ The difference is that Kansas' top environmental official refused to go along with that recommendation. ""I believe it would be irresponsible to ignore emerging information about the contribution of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to climate change,"" said Roderick L. Bremby, who heads the state's environmental agency.\ Mr. Bremby decided that under Kansas state law, he has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court found in June that federal environmental regulators have the same authority, but Bush administration officials have chosen to not exercise it.\ On the same day that Mr. Bremby denied the coal plant's permit, a bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate that would create a ""cap-and- trade"" system for carbon emissions. That bill, sponsored by Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., would limit carbon dioxide emissions and set up a national system under which companies could buy and sell the right to pollute. A similar system has been in place since 1990 for emissions that cause acid rain.\ The best approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is international, but it also makes sense to have a national standard. The action to stop the plant in Kansas is unprecedented and could well signal an increasing environmental sensitivity at the state level that has been woefully absent at the federal level. But its actual envionmental benefits will be slight, so long as other states allow more greenhouse gas sources to come on line. The damage is cumulative, so the response must be collective.\ International leaders are meeting in December to establish a new framework for reducing carbon emissions. It's crucial that Congress take action, too. Complaining about emissions no longer cuts it. It's time to act."

Help after the fire deserves thanks
\
On behalf of the staff of Community Housing Ministry Inc. and the board and staff of Danford Hall, we extend our grateful appreciation for everyone who came to our aid during and after Sunday afternoon's fire. From Sgt. Smith of the St. Joseph Police Department and all his officers, to the firefighters who responded so ably, to the staff and volunteers of the American Red Cross and the members of Wyatt Park Christian Church who opened their doors and their arms to reach out, we offer our most sincere thank you. Although the heartbreak of this event will take time to heal, each of you that did extend your help got everyone started in the right direction.
\
God bless you all.

Vote with qualifications, positions in mind
\
We were appalled at Pat Baker's letter accusing Dr. Rob Schaaf of attacking the Catholic Church in his campaign for Missouri Senate. As lifelong Catholics, we had hoped that type of mudslinging had largely disappeared from the American political landscape after John F. Kennedy's successful 1960 presidential campaign.
\
To say, ""Mr. Schaaf and his supporters have instead resorted to attacking the Catholic Church"" simply because of a letter from one of his supporters is ludicrous. Can you cite a single statement from Dr. Schaaf to support this absurd accusation? We have known Dr. Schaaf casually for a number of years. We may not always agree with his political positions, but we find we share many of the same values.
\
We do not know, nor do we care, which church Dr. Schaaf and his family may attend. We consider him to be a decent, honorable man. We have appreciated his strong pro-life position and his support of what we consider basic family values.
\
We will not be voting in the Schaaf-DeStefano race, as we are in the Democratic primary. At the same time, we resent the baseless accusation that Dr. Schaaf is attacking the Catholic Church. We would hope this race would be decided on the basis of qualifications and positions on the issues, not on a reckless accusation.

Mudslinging campaign against Schaaf wrong
\
Dirty, low-down, gutter politics has emerged in the 34th Senatorial District race by the John DeStefano campaign committee.
\
He has attacked Dr. Rob Schaaf with lies, distortions and out-of-context misrepresentations, bringing up Dr. Schaaf's record of embracing medical marijuana, of calling himself a racist and accusing Schaaf of attacking children with autism.
\
Who is the real Dr. Rob Schaaf? Several years ago he sponsored, and the Missouri legislature passed, the infection control bill that required hospitals to take steps to reduce infections. Since then, hospital infections in Missouri have dropped and many lives have been saved. As a physician, he is a voice for patients' rights. It is no wonder that one of the largest lobbyists, the Missouri Hospital Association, and its registered lobbyist, Mr. David Barklage, also executive director for the Majority Fund, are supporting Dr. Schaaf's opponent.
\
Dr. Schaaf has represented Buchanan and Andrew counties in the Missouri House with honor and dedication. He has always kept us informed of legislation in the House.
\
He held weekly meetings available for the public and local government to attend.
\
Republican primary voters, don't be fooled by slick mailings and TV commercials. We know Dr. Schaaf to be a man of family values, 2nd Amendment rights to bear arms, champion of patient rights and a proven conservative for the past eight years.
\
Please vote Aug. 3 for Dr. Rob Schaaf.
\

\
Truth or consequence?
\
Truth: Dr. Rob Schaaf is verifiably always available to his constituents on evenings, weekends and holidays.
\
Truth: Dr. Schaaf will stand up to any conglomerate (i.e., industrial medical complex) in the best interest of the individual.
\
Truth: Dr. Schaaf does not spin/distort the truth -- it is what it is.
\
Truth: Dr. Schaaf does not need to be bought at the last second. His integrity is well known, genuine and free.
\
Consequence: Taking a chance on a questionable, unknown lacking a relevant record of experience.

FOX News didn't hit new low
\
I find it sad that Mr. Roger Moore condemns FOX News in the Shirley Sherrod affair, seeming to ignore both the facts and the White House and NAACP response.
\
FOX News was not the first to air the Shirley Sherrod tape! Admittedly O'Reilly, with the same information the White House had, commented that if it was true, she should resign. There was no mention of her on the Glenn Beck show that day. I question the NAACP response since her comments were given at an NAACP meeting and the clip shown was from their tape.
\
The very next day, after seeing the entire tape, O'Reilly immediately admitted his error, apologized and insisted that her firing was unfair. Glenn Beck spent time on his show defending the woman!
\
I did not see O'Reilly's original comment, but I did see his apology and the Glenn Beck show defending her. This occurred after her firing and before the NAACP or the White House reversed their stand, so I wonder exactly what Mr. Moore is referring to when he says FOX News has hit a new low?

Premium Standard Farms just as important
\
In the past week, Premium Standard Farms filed an aggressive, two-year schedule with the Jackson County Circuit Court to implement Next Generation Technology the expert panel approved in May. I am asking community members to send letters to Gov. Jay Nixon and Attorney Gen. Chris Koster requesting their support of PSF's schedule and to extend the consent decree.
\
PSF has worked hard over the last 10 years by spending more than $40 million to create, test and implement technologies that improve our environment, reduce odor and ultimately protect jobs. I believe it is in the best interest of our communities to show support in Jefferson City for the thousands of jobs that PSF creates and supports in Northern Missouri.
\
Ask Gov. Nixon and Attorney Gen. Koster to support PSF jobs as strongly as the state does for urban citizens in extending millions of dollars in tax credits to Ford to keep its plant from closing. Remind them PSF is just as important to Northern Missouri as Ford is to Kansas City.
\
Remind Gov. Nixon and Attorney Gen. Koster the importance of Premium Standard Farms in Northern Missouri. Ask them to support extending the consent decree and allow PSF to continue investing in our communities. Support Northern Missouri and write a letter to Gov. Nixon and Attorney Gen. Koster.

Reporter, News-Press deserve thanks
\
I represent an amazing agency of the U.S. government. The agency name is Rural Development and it is an agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. However, just because it is small, this agency achieves huge accomplishments. For example, in 2009, $1.2 billion was returned to Missouri to help rural areas.
\
Rural Development is known as the only agency of the U.S. government that can build a community from the ground up. We have over 40 loan, grant and guarantee programs that can assist individuals, families, businesses, cities and communities with housing; jobs; community facilities like medical clinics, hospitals, nursing homes, rescue equipment, fires and police stations; infrastructure like water, sewer, electricity, broadband, streets and parking lots; and the list goes on and on. We also have loans and grants for renewable energy and to improve energy efficiency for individuals, farmers and businesses.
\
The only caveat is we can only help communities that meet the definition of ""rural."" Based on the specific program, the definition of ""rural"" is either a community with a population of 20,000 or sometimes 50,000 or less.
\
Rural Development does not have authority or sufficient funding to pay for advertising to promote its programs. We rely solely on our own outreach including newsletters, direct mailings, word-of-mouth and, most importantly, local media coverage of the accomplishments achieved.
\
The St. Joseph News-Press has been a terrific partner of USDA-Rural Development. They have generously and accurately reported on many USDA-Rural Development programs, which has greatly assisted in Northwest Missouri's usage of the available programs.
\
I recently had the opportunity to recognize one of the News-Press staff writers, Marshall White. Mr. White has gone out of his way to learn about the many programs available and report on those programs. His reporting and the newspaper's publishing his articles have resulted in many new inquiries and applications across Northwest Missouri.
\
For that I say thank you to Mr. Marshall White and the St. Joseph News-Press!

Government kills small-business dreams
\
Weeks into the Gulf oil-spill disaster, one thing has become abundantly clear.
\
No matter how long it takes BP's crews to ultimately bring that under control, no matter how much bumbling in the process, they will do that many times faster and with far greater effectiveness than the Obama administration ever will show with regard to managing the economy and creating jobs.
\
Never in my 60 years have I seen such a set of dream-killing, job-killing, economy-killing set of policies, ideas and attitudes.
\
Among the dreams of others that have been dashed, this administration has effectively killed a dream of mine. Humblest of small businessmen, I am the owner and operator of one Class 8 diesel truck -- a truck driver with a nearly perfect safety record over 33 yeas and about 3.5 million miles.
\
With retirement age on the horizon, and pending the sale of an inherited farm, I had hopes of finishing the last five to six years of my career in style, perhaps even extending the career to age 70 or so. I had planned to buy a new truck, replacing the nine-year-old truck I presently own -- still in good shape, still perfectly usable.
\
At the present time, however, I'm looking at the tsunami of regulations and policies bearing down upon my industry and deciding I don't think I'm going to stay in that business long enough to justify owning a new truck. Such things as EOBR regulations, LCV regulations, adjustments to HOS regulations and CSA 2010 regulations are all heading our way and really have thrown a paralyzing ""jolt"" into this whole segment of American business. ""Cap and trade"" proposals and proposed EPA regulation of diesel emissions are two more.
\
My apologies to the manufacturing worker for the hours he won't get building that $120,000 piece of equipment that I now won't buy. My apologies also to the company driver whose dream to become a small businessman would have been aided by a fantastic low price on my present old truck.
\
Last but not least, my apologies to my fellow citizens for not being stronger and more willing to pursue these economy-enhancing goals in the face of the dream-killing, business-destroying, economy-damaging machine that this present administration seems to be.

38,"Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt has refused to join nine Midwestern states in endorsing the bulk of a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\Blunt was a no-show when the states, including Illinois, signed on to the plan last month. On Wednesday, he said he had reviewed the plan and decided to endorse only parts of it, saying that the key component would hurt Missouri jobs, consumers and ratepayers. \When the Midwestern Governors Association endorsed the plan, the region became the third in the nation to sign a pact aimed at combatting global warming. Leaders who committed to the plan said it is critical in the absence of a national climate change policy.\The heart of the agreement is to reduce greenhouse gases by developing a cap and trade program, which involves allowing companies to buy and sell pollution credits.\""I do not believe a regional carbon dioxide cap and trade system would really address a national problem,"" Blunt said. ""Any cap and trade system would need to be national in order to be effective.""\The governor did agree to endorse other aspects of the regional plan, including the continued promotion of biofuels and an assessment of the current energy transmission infrastructure, including power lines and gas pipelines. \""We're glad that a month after the Midwestern Governor's climate change summit, Gov. Blunt has decided to join the conversation,"" said Erin Noble, energy policy outreach coordinator for the Missouri Coalition for the Environment. ""But without signing what they're calling the tier two provision, there's not much substance there.""\Missouri environmental groups applauded what they too called ""a first step"" but encouraged Blunt to commit Missouri to meaningful actions that reduce greenhouse gases.\In November, the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental think tank, reported that between 1990 and 2003, Missouri's greenhouse gas emissions grew by 26 percent, more than any other Midwestern state.\Judi Greenwald, director of innovative solutions for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, a clearinghouse for climate change research based in Arlington, Va., said that until now, Missouri didn't show up on many of the lists the center compiles that documents states' efforts to combat global warming.\""I think the interesting thing is this literally puts Missouri on a map,"" Greenwald said. ""I think it's a very important first step. Maybe you've reached a tipping point there.""\Blunt noted that both Nebraska and North Dakota, two members of the Midwestern Governors Association, also did not sign the regional plan's greenhouse gas accord. \His spokeswoman said that while Missouri is considered a member state of the association, the state isn't sending a delegate to functions in an effort to save money.\Blunt said he sent a letter to the association's chairman, Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle, outlining Missouri's energy structure, including information about the state's coal and biofuel production.\""Missouri is a unique energy provider and my primary concern is the impact of any agreement on Missouri energy consumers, Missouri jobs and Missouri's environment,"" Blunt said. ""While the ultimate goal of cleaner energy production is essential to our continued development, we must also responsibly balance the technologies available and minimize the adverse impact on Missouri consumers.""\Carla Vigue, a spokeswoman for Doyle, did not say whether the governor had read Blunt's letter, only that Doyle considered the regional plan critically important.\""Each governor has their own reason for doing what they do; we can't comment on that,"" she said. ""What I can say is that Gov. Doyle believes that the Midwest has to be an energy leader in the future and depend less on the Middle East.""\Credit: Kim McGuire; ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH"
39,"The discussion on global warming rages overseas and in our own backyards.\The internal blog accessible to current and former members of the News-Leader Community Editorial Advisory Board has been generating some of its own heat. Below we offer a sampling of some of the comments and interplay of opinions.\We asked the blog members to respond to these questions.\Global warming: a hoax or a threat? Is man the problem? Will ""cap and trade"" help?\What if the U.S. reduces emissions and other big countries continue polluting?\----------------------\David Gibson said:\Even if it is a hoax, for our own well-being we need to practice being green. We need to lessen our addiction to oil any way we can. We need to do this for several reasons. Were any of you in the Los Angeles area in the '60s? ... If you went outside it wasn't long before you were laboring for air and your eyes would turn red and itching.\This wasn't every day but almost every week for a day or two at a time. Since California implemented smog control the air in Los Angeles is almost normal. ...\Duncan Craycroft said:\I was born in East L.A. (remember the Cheech and Chong song?) and I know firsthand that smog sucks! Have you ever seen the pictures of downtown L.A. where everything is buried in a layer of haze? I dare you to tell me that this has no impact on people's health. I know too many people that have been affected by this poison to accept an argument that man doesn't affect the health of our planet.\Karl Kime said:\Let me first say that I also agree that we need to conserve our resources, lesson our impact on the environment, reduce our reliance on foreign oil, etc.\I agree there is no argument on this. But it is looking like there can be some debate concerning the global warming issue and to what extent mankind is culpable. What I don't understand is why there is so much resistance on both sides of the argument to take an additional look at this.\I think it is fair to generalize that the left believes in man-made global warming and the right does not. ... What I find discouraging is the outrage I am met with when I discuss this with someone on either side of the issue.\From the left: ""What?!?! You don't believe in global warming? Are you an idiot? Do you also think the earth is flat? Haven't you seen the shrinking glaciers? We must do something now! Oh, the humanity!""\From the right: ""What?!?! You believe those tree-huggers? Do you wear tin-foil on your head? Do you also not believe we landed on the moon? You know it is all political! You must have Al Gore bed sheets!""\... One thing I know is that all of the politicians want a crisis. We must have more crisis so they can steer us through the turbulent waters. God help us if we ever have to help ourselves.\Craycroft added:\A Pew poll released today shows that 36 percent polled believe man causes global warming. The same poll shows 55 percent believe in guardian angels ...\Jim Evans said:\On Friday, oil refiner Valero announced the complete shutdown of a refinery in Delaware City due to low demand for gasoline. It has become less expensive to generate electricity with wind than coal. A few months makes a big difference. ""Drill baby drill"" sounds silly today.\In early August 2008, Rush Limbaugh ridiculed Obama for suggesting we be conservative energy consumers. Rush sarcastically chided that ""he tuned up his car and adjusted the tire pressure but did not see the price of gasoline go down.""\Rush just wasn't paying attention. Gasoline at Wal-Mart in Republic has gone from $3.90 per gallon to $2.40 per gallon in the past 16 months (a decline of 38 percent). From August to December last year it dropped 50 percent. Refineries have shut down, production reduced and emergency meetings convened by oil producers to address the oversupply crisis.\Economically encouraged conservation gave oil producers a taste of reduced consumption. They found it to be a bitter pill. Now they fear there is an even greater threat to their easy profits in the form of renewable energy initiatives. Given the profit devastation caused by the recent drop in global demand, what will happen if nations vigorously pursue conservation, efficiency, hydro, geothermal, wind, solar, wave, and other power creation options?\Paul Sidio said:\Macro changes are usually caused by a lot of micro changes all coming together. We can look at our world and see micro climate changes humans have caused in the relatively recent past, ranging from desertification from cutting down forests to altering the course and flow of rivers. We see how our actions can reduce or wipe out species in a small area and then hope the effects don't spill over to the entire globe.\There is a concept called ""tipping point."" That is when a lot of small things finally add up enough to cause a seemingly sudden large shift or change.\Snow avalanches are a good example of this. We don't know where the global climate tipping points are. We don't know if they are approaching or if they have already passed. It is something we should be taking a very serious look at.\Bruce Michaels said:\The science notes I have been presented with steer me to believe the climate change trend is much more about finding excuses to move our dollars around and try to control things than it is to save the planet.\These are the notes I'm referring to: Carbon dioxide represents less than 0.4 percent of greenhouse gases. The plants use our CO2 and need it to give us our oxygen. Man's measurable percentage of the effect on the 0.4 percent of CO2 is not proven, but is likely a similar tiny fraction. When you hear that the Mt. St. Helen's volcano eruption, for example, produced more CO2 than California's annual output in a year, the argument that nature is by far the dominant influence on global temperature makes sense. Water vapor makes up the lion's share of our planet's greenhouse gases, and we would not have life without them. Then consider the many times you may have heard that the planet has been in a cooling trend for the last nine years ... a bit different from the claims I'm hearing in the Copenhagen climate summit.\Then look at the ""Climategate"" scandal, where an influential climate science group omitted and/or skewed the data to fit the global warming argument.\I believe the Earth and sun will have natural cycles that we can't do anything about.\If our president agrees to a global ""cap and trade"" type agreement, it will mean us paying for underdeveloped countries to ""catch up"" to our technologies, standard of living, etc., and that's a big etc.!\Do you trust this upcoming cap and trade scheme? I don't. It is a political posturing opportunity to grab power, influence, and of course, money, all under the concern for our environment.\If I'm wrong, I guess the Earth will blow up or something.\Sidio added:\If I'm wrong the Earth will blow up? That's funny.\Actually the possible consequences of a runaway carbon based global warming would be more like flooding of the areas of the world where about 70 percent of the planet's people currently live, forcing them to relocate.\How hard would it be to relocate 3-4 billion people and all that infrastructure?\... Here is a way to put it into perspective. The consequences, if they exist are so vital to us, that we should at least spend the resources looking into the matter for a year that we spend in Iraq and Afghanistan in a single week.\Evans added:\The Earth is an enormous heat sink. It takes a very, very long time to reach a thermal stasis (the balance between heat gain and heat loss) after any change in the system. Heat trapped in the atmosphere is quickly absorbed into the oceans and land. A state change in matter (i.e. ice to water) also requires heat. If heat is slowly added to a glass of ice water, the temperature of the water will remain roughly the same until the ice melts. The temperature of your car in the sun can be dramatically reduced by spraying a reflective coating onto the windows that is less than .01 percent as thick as the glass.\Very small adjustments magnified by time can result in huge changes.\Michaels added:\Thanks, Paul. The ""maybe the earth will blow up"" comment was meant for humorous sarcasm and a poke at ""the sky is falling"" rhetoric.\Kime added:\Paul -- Let me see if I understand you correctly. The earth is estimated to be approximately 4.5 billion years old. Modern humans are estimated to have been on earth roughly 10,000 years. (My numbers may not be exact, but it's really academic when discussing that kind of percentage).\In that small percentage of time, humans are going to be solely responsible for knocking the Earth off of its axis?\Ian Mackey said:\I agree with Gibby's (Gibson's) sentiments. We could be doomed, or we could be duped.\We can (and should) debate the causes of global warming all day but the bottom line -- that both sides should agree upon -- is the fact that we ought to be conscious about what we consume. We ought to consume goods and services as efficiently and responsibly as possible -- and certainly we should all recycle.\We all may not be able to afford a windmill in our front yard, or solar panels on our roof, but we can sure separate our plastics and cans and cardboard and take them down to the recycling plant.\Nobody on either side of the global warming debate enjoys staring at trash. We should all do a better job to recycle and reuse the products we purchase, instead of adding more trash to our planet."

41,"Editor's note: Three area professors recently met with the News-Leader editorial board to stress their common view that climate change creates economic and biological dangers. We decided to pass some of their questions to area lawmakers on the federal level, and the lawmakers have chosen to answer for publication three questions each.\Today is the second installment.\Questions were drafted by biology professors Alexander Wait, Ph.D., Missouri State University; and Wendy Anderson, Ph.D., Drury University; and economics associate professor Terrel Gallaway, Ph.D., MSU.\In this particular installment, the professors drafted a different question for U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt, based on comments he's made previously.\If you have a question on this subject you would like us to pass to the lawmakers, e-mail Editorial Page Editor Dave Iseman, diseman@news-leader.com.\Question for U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt: You've cited cost estimates for the House-passed energy legislation from groups that are opposed to the legislation, including ""a $3,000 tax on consumers"" and this bill ""will double Missouri electric bills."" However, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the legislation would cost the average household around $175/year, with low-income households actually saving money. This is clearly much less than $3,000 or a 100 percent increase. Why do you choose to cite the opponents of the legislation and not cite the non-partisan Congressional office that was created to make these calculations? It's true that because of our state's dependency on coal and low cost of living, Missourians will fall on the upper end of that national average. Even with that in mind, a 100 percent increase seems exceedingly unlikely. What is your basis for saying Missouri's costs would be 17 times higher than the CBO's national average estimate?\Blunt said: In the case of the Washington Democrats' national energy tax supported by Robin Carnahan, this particular CBO estimate makes a fundamental error in assuming that the heavy costs of this program will not be passed on from industry to consumers and that Missouri families will be unaffected by the bill's net negative effect on the national economy. But meanwhile the 2009 White House budget assumed $640 billion in revenues from the cap-and-trade national energy tax. Where did the Obama Administration think that money was going to come from?\Someone pays those taxes. And those costs have to be made up somewhere -- most often at the expense of consumers, families, and small businesses. Even President Obama admitted this tax would [cause] energy prices to ""skyrocket.""\After the final cap-and-trade bill was unveiled, energy and budget analysts at the Heritage Foundation calculated its impact based on real-world factors that were unfortunately not allowed to be considered by government budget analysts. That study found that the legislation would have a domino effect on economic conditions, with spiraling energy costs leading to damaging trade distortions, resulting in thousands of lost jobs, and ultimately causing a reduction in GDP. Once they accounted for these impacts, the Heritage Foundation determined the real cost of this legislation to the average family of four would be $2,700. You can read this study here: www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2009/08/The-Economic-Consequences-of-Waxman-Markey-An-Analysis-of-the-American-Clean-Energy-and-Security-Act-of-2009.\In addition, Heritage found that the cap and trade national energy tax would cost Missouri more than 32,000 lost jobs in the first year alone. http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2009/08/Impact-of-the-Waxman-Markey-Climate-Change-Legislation-on-Missouri\Finally, a Missouri study conducted by the Unified Missouri Electric Utilities study indicating that Missourians could see a rate increase of nearly 80 percent in the next 10 years if this energy tax is enacted.\http://www.missourienergy.org/pdf/co2_legislation.pdf\Question for senators Christopher ""Kit"" Bond and Claire McCaskill:\The National Academy of Sciences, which advises the government on scientific matters, is strongly urging that the U.S. cut greenhouse gas emissions. We, as plant biologists who also work in marine systems, are very concerned about an apparent lack of understanding of the potential negative effects of greenhouse gas emissions on marine and terrestrial systems. For example, photosynthesis in corn is not stimulated by any additional increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and recent research has illustrated that increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reduces soybean resistance to pests. The economic losses due to increased greenhouse gas emissions may well be greater than economic losses from controlling emissions. However, the Murkowski resolution would block the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Please justify your support or lack of support for curbing greenhouse gas emissions based on both the potential negative effects of emissions on terrestrial and marine systems and processes (from warming to decreased ocean pH) and the effects on short term economics.\Bond said: With job-killing cap-and-trade legislation stalled in the Senate, the EPA is attempting to end-run Congress and impose costly backdoor carbon regulations on the American people. We can and should promote clean energy solutions that will also result in lower carbon emissions. I support a greater use of zero-carbon nuclear energy, low-carbon bio-fuels, clean coal and clean vehicle technology, and energy efficiency. However, proposals such as new EPA mandates will have no measurable impact on world temperatures while they impose serious job-loss and economic hardship from massive new energy taxes on American families and workers.\EPA scientists themselves, as EPA Administrator Jackson confirmed last year, conclude that the U.S. imposing its own climate legislation without similar efforts by China and India will result in almost no measurable impact on world temperatures. As long as clean energy alternatives remain unaffordable, China and India will continue to refuse to limit their efforts to pull their populations out of poverty.\EPA efforts to circumvent Congress and impose its own climate regulations will similarly fail to change world temperatures. In my book, there is no justifying allowing the EPA to proceed with new job-killing energy, cost-raising regulations when the result will mean all pain for U.S. families and no gain for the environment. That's why I have joined 39 of my colleagues in the Senate to block unelected bureaucrats at EPA from circumventing elected officials. Scientists and engineers who want to be productive should apply themselves to producing affordable clean energy solutions the world can afford to adopt and that will have a real impact in reducing emissions and world temperatures.\McCaskill said: As I have said before, climate change is a serious problem and curbing emissions is something that must be addressed. While I am sympathetic to some of Senator Murkowski's concerns, I ultimately voted against her resolution because it would eliminate EPA's ability to regulate emissions from vehicles. The government and the auto industry have agreed to set these new standards for vehicle emissions and it would be a mistake to jeopardize this historic agreement which will reduce our dependence on oil by 1.8 billion barrels. Because of this agreement, compared with today's vehicles, a family purchasing a vehicle under the new standards will save, on average, more than $3,000 on fuel costs over the life of that vehicle. Instead of supporting Sen. Murkowski's resolution, I am working with Senator Rockefeller to pass his alternative approach, which I cosponsor, that would delay the implementation of the EPA's regulation of energy sources for two years. This would give Congress time to figure out how we can reduce emissions without burdening consumers and small businesses in Missouri, while still allowing the EPA to move forward on regulating auto emissions. I believe this is a better option that will not unfairly penalize Missourians."

NEW YORK (AP) -- Economists are pleased with the Federal Reserve's policy on interest rates but skeptical of the government's ability to rein in spending, curb greenhouse gases and overhaul health care, a new survey finds.
\
The latest semiannual survey by the National Association for Business Economics, released today, indicates almost 70 percent of the 266 economists surveyed earlier this month think the Fed's monetary policy is ""about right,"" up from 63 percent in March and 56 percent a year ago.
\
The results come as indicators point to an improving economy, presenting policymakers with wrenching decisions over how quickly to roll back measures taken in the past year to avert a financial collapse. Quick action risks plunging the economy into another dive, and moving too slowly could drive inflation.
\
Meanwhile, the Obama administration is taking ambitious steps to curb greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, cut health care costs and reform financial regulation.
\
""This is almost certainly one of the fastest-moving and most controversial economic policy environments we have experienced in a generation,"" said NABE President Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers LLC.
\
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, appointed by the president last week to a second four-year term, cut the Fed funds rate to near zero in December to reduce the cost of borrowing and introduced a slew of emergency lending programs.
\
The survey found economists split on what should come next, with 49 percent saying the Fed should leave monetary policy alone for the next six months and 45 percent in favor of a more restrictive policy. However, 56 percent versus 44 percent said they expect the Fed to leave interest rates untouched rather than hiking rates to avoid inflation.
\
Although economists think the Fed is targeting a 2 percent inflation rate, they expect the actual rate of core inflation to average 3 percent from 2014 to 2018.
\
The prediction reflects economists' concerns about the federal government's ability to reverse the steps it has taken to stimulate growth. A large majority doubt federal lawmakers can bring down spending. Three quarters said they want a more restrictive fiscal policy over the next two years -- only 28 percent expect it to happen.
\
About 58 percent predict the government's fiscal policy will boost economic growth by between one-half and 1[1/2] percentage points over the next year. Just more than three-quarters of economists surveyed say no new stimulus package is needed.
\
The survey found serious doubts about the effectiveness of federal government proposals for a cap-and-trade program to cut emissions. Only 15 percent believe cap and trade would significantly cut global emissions, and 56 percent believe the plan would actually boost emissions overseas by pushing business activity to countries with fewer restrictions. However, only 28 percent said those cap-and-trade-related business shifts would significantly hamper domestic economic activity.
\
None of the major health care proposals being debated in Congress drew much support from the economists surveyed.
\
Fewer than half believe most of the proposals would bring overall improvements in health care, give more Americans access to it or drive down costs. Forty-seven percent expect the reforms would ""decrease quality and increase costs.""

43,"News-Leader\Jefferson City -- An effort by City Utilities of Springfield to get limited legal liability for its carbon sequestration project took one step backwards and another step forward on Tuesday.\First, in the morning, the House Energy and Environment Committee rejected the legislation, stripping it from a large energy bill.\But in the afternoon, the Senate commerce committee passed a version of the bill, limiting personal injury liability exemptions to just Greene County. Carbon sequestration is the process of injecting the harmful greenhouse gas into the earth, at least 2,000 feet below the surface.\City Utilities is leading a $3 million pilot project among Missouri utility companies to test the viability of the emerging technology at its 1,000-acre power plant on the southwest side of Springfield.\But CU and other power companies want the legal liability for injecting carbon dioxide into the ground to be capped at $2 million or $300,000 per individual -- the same protection limit afforded to governmental entities.\Sen. Kurt Schaefer, R-Columbia, got the Senate bill passed, 6-3. It now advances to the full chamber.\Rep. Shane Schoeller, R-Willard, had sought to get the legislation passed in the House, but the committee approved an amendment taking it out of a bill on a voice vote. He proposed letting the liability cap sunset at the end of 2014 to ensure it wasn't being abused.\But Democratic Rep. Jason Holsman of Kansas City sought to take out Schoeller's bill from the larger bill, arguing that utility companies should not be afforded the same type of limited liability from lawsuits that state government agencies get. He said if they gave power companies more legal immunity, then other private businesses would come knocking at the doors of the legislature for protections.\""I think it sets a bad precedent,"" Holsman said during committee debate.\Schoeller said utility companies need the lawsuit protection to encourage investment in carbon sequestration, which could be a new way to reduce greenhouse gases that some scientists believe are causing global warming.\He also said the legislation is a proactive approach to preparing for potential federal laws taxing power companies and factories for their carbon dioxide output. The Obama administration has made a cap-and-trade tax the cornerstone of its energy policy.\""Because of the political reality of it, I think we need to allow this research to go forward,"" Schoeller said."

45,"Congress seems finally on the verge of acting to limit carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. As part of this effort, loan guarantees would play an important part if Congress lets them.\In late June, the House passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act, which now is before the Senate. While the cap-and-trade part of the act has received the most attention, another important but less well known part of the act would create a clean energy bank to provide loan guarantees.\Loan guarantees can be an effective method of addressing global warming. Loan guarantees are attractive because, if the backed projects are evaluated carefully, as they are required to be under the act, the risk of default is small, and the cost to the government, and therefore to taxpayers, is small. But the environmental gains can be substantial.\Cap-and-trade would limit carbon emissions from existing electricity generators and other sources of carbon emissions. The required permits under cap-and-trade would make the cost of generating electricity from coal include at least part of the cost to the environment of carbon emissions.\The clean energy bank, on the other hand, would be established to support technologies to generate electricity from sources such as nuclear plants that do not create significant carbon emissions. There are some other technologies, such as wind and solar power, that also would qualify, but they often are expensive and the quantity of electricity that can be generated is limited. Other technologies, such as carbon capture from coal-burning electricity plant _ while promising, still are in the experimental stage.\Nuclear power is cost-competitive with clean coal and offers a proven, reliable way of obtaining the required large amounts of electricity that we will need over the next few years. The United States now generates about 20 percent of its electricity from nuclear power, and the operating nuclear plants have proven less costly and much more reliable than anticipated. France, for instance, generates 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. There is nothing experimental about the technology and, indeed, the next generation of nuclear power plants promises to be even better.\Because nuclear power plants are expensive to build - but with relatively low operating costs - loan guarantees are important and may be crucial to their construction. Therefore, it makes little sense that the legislation as now drafted limits any energy source to no more than 30 percent of the total loan guarantees. This ignores the relatively high capital cost of nuclear power plants, and, consequently, their special need for loan guarantees. Limiting loan guarantees for nuclear power plants probably would result in loan guarantees for energy that is more expensive and uses unproven or less proven technology. That may mean a higher default rate, costing taxpayers more, at the same time contributing less to clean energy and energy independence. Loan guarantees for nuclear power plants without the 30 percent limit would comport with the purpose of the act, limit costs to taxpayers, and provide carbon-emissions-free electricity at the lowest possible cost.\Electricity will become more and more important in our economy. In addition to the normal growth in demand, switching to electric vehicles, for example, would mean that the electricity to power them must come from somewhere. We need to find ways of generating that electricity that do not contribute to global warming. Loan guarantees for nuclear power, as well as other zero- or low-carbon technologies, can play an important part in both energy independence and reduced carbon emissions. It makes no sense to limit artificially benefits from these loan guarantees by restricting the amount of loan guarantees devoted to nuclear power when nuclear power is the best option for a substantial source of new, clean electricity.\---\Stanford L. Levin is Emeritus Professor of Economics at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. He has consulted in energy economics and served on the Illinois Commerce Commission, the state public utility regulatory agency."
46,"The energy to repower the U.S. economy and create family-supporting jobs should and must come primarily from undeveloped energy supplies right here in America. I support expanded production of all American energy, including continuing development of small and high-cost sources such as wind and solar power. I absolutely do not support the anti-jobs policies of the cap and tax bill.\Before addressing the attacks on me that were obviously designed to help the liberal candidate in the U.S. Senate race, permit me to make a general point about the economic and energy policies of the one-party Congress directed by Barack Obama, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. Almost anywhere you look, you find liberal policies that are assured of destroying even more jobs and holding back an economic recovery.\The bill to ""deform"" health care imposes large new taxes on working families, seniors and employers, which will harm employment and recovery. This includes the wasteful and failed ""stimulus"" spending that drains urgently needed funds away from private, job-creating investment, into ever larger government.\The same is true for the cap and tax bill, the explosion in federal deficits and national debt which is bankrupting future generations and mortgaging America's future, and legislation to damage Missouri's economic environment and personal freedom by taking away the secret ballot for representation by labor organizations.\As for cap and tax, when liberals are losing an argument, one of their tactics is to engage in character attacks by asserting ill motive.\Liberals and liberal special interest groups have for months tried to fool Missourians that the cap and tax debate is about campaign contributions. It is about a liberal plan endorsed by my opponent to raise your electric bill, destroy even more family-supporting jobs and raise the price of essentially everything.\A Heritage Foundation study found that cap and tax would cost Missouri 32,225 jobs in 2012 alone, including 3,902 jobs in Southwest Missouri.\Nationally, cap and tax would lower employment by over 1.1 million jobs and in some years it would reduce employment by 2.5 million jobs.\An Obama administration analysis showed a cap and trade system could increase energy prices by $1,761 per family. Another study conducted for the Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility Commission showed it could increase Missourians' energy bills by as much as 40 percent over five years and 80 percent over 10 years. Even President Obama, who supports the tax, said it would cause electricity rates to ""skyrocket.""\This year, environmental extremists have spent about $750,000 in false and negative TV and radio ads against me because I am standing up for families, farmers, employers and every Missourian who pays an electric bill, all of whom would be injured greatly by this destructive legislation. These very liberal groups want Robin Carnahan in the Senate because Carnahan supports cap-and-tax. I am glad for Missourians to examine this issue and see who is fighting for them.\Roy Blunt represents Missouri's 7th Congressional District and is a Republican candidate for the United States Senate."
47,"A federal appeals court said Friday that the Bush administration ignored the law when it imposed less stringent requirements on power plants to reduce mercury pollution, which scientists fear could cause neurological problems in 60,000 newborns a year. \A three-judge panel unanimously struck down a mercury-control plan imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency three years ago. The plan established an emissions trading process in which some plants could avoid installing the best mercury control technology available by buying pollution credits. \Environmentalist and health experts argued that such a cap-and-trading mechanism would create ""hot spots"" of mercury contamination near some power plants. Seventeen states as well as environmental and health groups joined in a suit to block the regulation, saying it did not adequately protect public health. \Power plants are the biggest source of releases of mercury, which finds its way into the food supply, particularly fish. Mercury can damage developing brains of fetuses and very young children. \The court decision was the latest in a string of judicial rebukes of the Bush administration's environmental policies. The Supreme Court last year took the administration to task for not regulating greenhouse gases. Courts also have rejected administration attempts to overhaul federal forest policies and streamline fuel economy standards for small trucks. \The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said that the EPA violated the federal Clean Air Act when it scrapped a mercury-control policy established in December 2000 under the Clinton administration. Utilities were required to install the best available technology to capture mercury from power-plant smokestacks. \That policy was anticipated to capture more than 90 percent of mercury releases. The cap-and-trade approach imposed by the EPA in March 2005 envisioned capturing 70 percent of emissions by 2018. \The court held that the EPA failed to show that its new approach would not harm the environment or that emissions at all plants not ""exceed a level which is adequate to protect public health with an ample margin of safety."" \""This three-judge panel has done the world a favor and helped save lives,"" said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, whose state participated in the lawsuit. \EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said the agency was reviewing the decision, but he indicated it was not giving up on the cap-and-trade approach to reducing mercury. He emphasized that the court did not rule directly on the merits of the cap-and-trade approach but that ""(it) ruled against the process."" \But it was clear the agency now would have to re-examine its approach to capturing mercury from power plants. ""Because of the court's action, the U.S. now has no national regulation to cut mercury emissions from existing power plants,"" Shradar said. \Environmentalists, hailing the decision, predicted it will require the EPA to issue the more stringent emissions requirements proposed eight years ago. ""This means the EPA is going to have to go back and do a real job of regulating all the toxics coming out of these plants,"" said Earthjustice attorney James S. Pew, who argued the case on behalf of several environmental organizations.\---\Get more \STLtoday.com/links- Read the court's opinion.\Credit: H. Josef Hebert; THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"
48,"News-Leader\Those convinced that the earth is warming -- and that such warming is going to trigger catastrophic disasters -- have jumped on to the latest eco-scare that just isn't backed by science, said Marc Morano who runs a Web site called Climate Depot.\Morano was among the speakers Thursday at a one-day conference called ""Debunking Climate Change Myths"" in Springfield.\About 150 attended the conference, presented by a group called ""Scientists for Truth."" Attendees included high school students, local politicians and others.\On ClimateDepot.com, Morano links to news stories about climate change, as well as providing his own thoughts on the issue.\In his speech, he said those who believe in global warming and its dangers also post messages -- noting the different sides of the debate may not get along.\""But at least they are fighting, they are engaging each other,"" he said.\While other speakers at the event presented scientific critiques, Morano offered quotes he's collected from various news sources, politicians and scientists.\In 1975, for instance, Newsweek Magazine sounded alarms over climactic change. But the difference was writers were warning of an impending ice age, he said.\In the 1980s and the 90s, the popular eco-cause became saving the Amazon Rainforests, a topic Morano made a documentary about in 2000.\But, Morano pointed out that even the New York Times reported that for every acre of rain forest being cut, 50 are growing back.\Until March, Morano worked for the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works committee, where he wrote a dissenting report that 700 scientists signed.\He said more scientists and others who previously supported a belief in catastrophic climate change are looking at data and challenging conventional wisdom.\However, he expressed amazement that more aren't challenging statements made from supporters like Nobel Prize winning economist Thomas Schelling.\According to Morano, Schelling was quoted in The Atlantic as wishing for natural disasters: ""I sometimes wish we could have over the next five or 10 years a lot of horrid things happening, you know, like tornados in the Mid west and so forth. That would get people concerned about climate change.""\Morano called characterized such statement as insane.\""A man who can't convince people on the science because the science isn't there, so he's now wishing for death, destruction on people through tornados,"" he said.\Morano predicted that the next ""eco-fears"" will include a so-called oxygen crisis -- a crisis caused by a shrinking supply of oxygen on earth -- and a crisis of plastic waste.\Laure David, producer of Al Gore's film on global warming, has been trying to draw attention to the issue of plastic waste, calling it ""in some ways more alarming"" for humans than global warming, Morano said.\The conference was organized by Ron Boyer, who runs a consulting firm. He also sits on the Missouri Air Conservation Commission -- though the conference was not connected to the commission.\Boyer said he wanted to hold the conference because he was tired of hearing that the debate on climate change is over.\""That's not how science works. Science continues to examine,"" said Boyer, who has an undergraduate degree in chemistry.\Boyer said future conferences will depend on whether or not the Senate passes the Cap and Trade legislation.\""If they do pass it, the debate is over because it will be a done deal,"" said Boyer.\But, he said, if it doesn't pass this year there will be a chance to continue debating the science another year.\John Lilly, a medical doctor and Willard school board member, said he attended the conference because he wanted to support the scientists who are trying to debunk global warming.\""Those who support global warming do it for political reasons rather than actual scientific reasons,"" he said."

51," With Congress preparing to take up landmark global warming legislation, Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond, R-Mo., signaled that he will be a hard sell when it comes to imposing limits on greenhouse gas emissions.\ Bond, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, was strongly critical of the newest climate change proposal in Congress, a so-called moderate plan offered by Sens. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and John Warner, R-Va.\ ""Your proposal would impose hardship on U.S. citizens and threatens robust growth in the U.S. economy,"" Bond repeated more than a half dozen times in a letter last week to the two senators.\ Lieberman and Warner had requested input from senators in what Warner had described as ""an honest, well-intentioned and bipartisan start,"" but did not regard Bond's letter as useful, according to a Lieberman aide. ""It doesn't appear that it was an effort on the part of Mr. Bond to help the Senate come up with legislation that can be approved, but a rhetorical effort to kill the bill,"" said David McIntosh, the Lieberman adviser.\ The Lieberman-Warner climate change plan aims to reduce greenhouse gases by 70 percent by 2050. It gives industry flexibility under a cap-and-trade system that permits the buying and selling of pollution credits under decreasing overall limits.\ The effort by Lieberman and Warner was viewed by some as a breakthrough because of the involvement of Warner, the second- ranking Republican on the Environment committee and a senior senator who hadn't supported global warming legislation before.\ But Warner, who recently announced his intention to retire after this term, said he had become persuaded that the warming planet poses imminent threats.\ Bond insisted that he had been specific in his criticisms and added that he hoped that the two senators would take his comments to heart.\ For instance, Bond said in his letter that businesses would be threatened because of duplicative state and regional carbon control programs and that low-income families would be harmed by higher energy costs.\ In an e-mail, Bond said that he intends to fight in coming months ""to ensure that climate legislation does not disproportionately hurt Missouri and the Midwest, blue-collar manufacturing workers supporting middle-class families and economically vulnerable families and seniors who will struggle with drastically higher energy bills.""\ The costs of combating global warming will be of prime consideration when Congress takes up the issue in the coming weeks. There are several main proposals, but Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee, said recently that the Lieberman-Warner plan could provide the basis for a bipartisan agreement.\ The issue has become infused with a new urgency as a result of a series of reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluding that global warming is indeed caused by human activity and that the effects already are showing. The panel, made up of more than 2,000 scientists from around the world, also said that the worst damage from rising seas could be prevented by immediate action.\ On Sept. 27, President George W. Bush will host two days of talks in Washington with government leaders from around the world in the first such administration effort aimed at reducing carbon emissions. The United Nations will sponsor a gathering earlier that week with the same goal.\ Despite all the attention, it is far from certain that the Congress can reach agreement this year.\ And the calendar is crowded, and the Iraq war and immigration remain prominent in the minds of many members.\ Credit: Bill Lambrecht; POST-DISPATCH WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF"
52,"NATION Reporter Sara Shipley: E-mail: sshipley@post-dispatch.com Phone: 314-340-8215\ The Environmental Protection Agency announced two proposals Thursday aimed at curtailing air pollution from power plants and industries that contribute to smog, soot and acid rain.\ In particular, the proposals could require additional pollution contr ols at coal-fired power plants in the St. Louis area and at a proposed cement plant in Ste. Genevieve County.\ Environmentalists welcomed elements of the proposals, which partly mirror President George W. Bush's stalled ""Clear Skies"" initiative. But they criticized other elements as continued rollbacks of the Clean Air Act.\ In the first announcement, the EPA proposed including Ste. Genevieve County in stricter ozone regulations due to take effect next year for the St. Louis metro region. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources had sought to exclude Ste. Genevieve from the ozone non-attainment area, which already comprises seven counties in Missouri and Illinois.\ EPA's major reason for targeting the mostly rural county appears to be the proposed construction on the Mississippi River of the nation's biggest cement plant. The plant would emit nitrogen oxide, which helps to create ozone, a gas that irritates the lungs and aggravates asthma.\ In a letter sent to Missouri officials Thursday, the EPA refers to ""potential major"" growth of nitrogen oxide emissions in the county without referring specifically to Holcim (US) Inc.'s proposed plant. The EPA said that ""Missouri has not established a convincing position that Ste. Genevieve County should be excluded because of the existence of unaddressed large, potential, and existing emissions sources lacking federally enforceable state-of-the- science emission controls ... .""\ Environmental groups want the natural resources agency to require Holcim to use a technology called selective catalytic reduction. Holcim initially said it wasn't feasible to use the technology on this plant, but state officials asked Holcim to reconsider, after discovering a cement plant in Germany successfully using the controls.\ Ted Heisel, executive director of the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, said EPA's decision should guide Missouri as it develops an air pollution permit for the plant. EPA's recommendation ""draws the conclusion, rightfully, that big emitters in Ste. Genevieve County have a pretty big impact on the whole St. Louis region,"" he said.\ But Leanne Tippett, director of the natural resources agency's air pollution control program, said Holcim's pending permit won't be affected by EPA's recommendation. ""They would play by the rules that were in existence at the time of their application,"" she said.\ Company spokeswoman Nancy Tully said, ""Our plant will meet or beat all applicable national air quality standards that are established to protect public health.""\ The second proposal issued Thursday related to a new ""cap-and- trade"" program for nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emitted by power plants. Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain, and both chemicals contribute to the formation of fine particles, or soot, that can cause heart and lung disease.\ Following a formula favored by the administration, the EPA proposed capping emissions of both pollutants. By 2015, the EPA would gradually decrease the emissions allowed in 30 states, including Missouri and Illinois. Power plants would be allowed to buy and sell emission rights.\ Some environmental groups took issue with the proposal, which will be formally released later this month. Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, said the plan, along with a recent proposal to cap mercury emissions from power plants, ""would continue to allow industry to pollute too much for too long."""
53,"
If the long conservative era that began with Ronald Reagan's election is over, will the judges appointed during the right's ascendancy be able to block, frustrate and undermine the efforts of a new progressive majority?
\
Consider this analysis from two influential journalists describing U.S. Supreme Court justices as ""the last hope of the conservative interests in the United States.""
\
Imagine, they write, that a new liberal approach to the country's problems ""had been overwhelmingly approved both in Congress and at the polling booths,"" so ""conservative interests resorted to the courts, starting literally thousands of actions to stay the government's hand."" Of the ensuing fight, they say: ""The liberal justices themselves called their conservative colleagues arbitrary and madly unwise. But while the liberals warned, the conservatives laughed.""
\
Yes, we might go back to the future. Those words are from a still-compelling 1938 book called ""The 168 Days"" by legendary Washington journalists Joseph Alsop and Turner Catledge. They were writing about the conservative Supreme Court that struck down so much of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal program and the effort by FDR to be given the power to name additional liberal justices to break the court's conservative majority.
\
Roosevelt's reach for expanded executive authority was unwise because he made it easy for his opponents to compare him to Hitler and Stalin. FDR lost the court-packing fight but eventually got to name justices in the normal way, and conservative judicial dominance ebbed.
\
The spate of 5-4 conservative decisions during the Supreme Court term just ended should stand as a warning that we might soon revisit the fights of 70 years ago. Yet almost nobody is talking about this danger. To the extent that judges have been a campaign issue in recent elections, the focus has been on a few hot-button issues, notably abortion. After the recent sharply contested Second Amendment case, perhaps gun rights will join the list.
\
But the more important question is whether conservative judges will see fit to do exactly what conservative courts did for much of the New Deal era by using a narrow, 19th-century definition of property rights to void progressive economic, environmental and labor regulation.
\
Many judicial conservatives view the late-1930s period as a disaster because it marked the end of their power on the courts. After the court-packing battle, the Supreme Court began to defer to the democratically elected branches of government and their efforts to regulate the economy in the public interest. Property rights were well protected throughout this time, yet government was allowed to set rules on the uses of property that judicial conservatives of the pre-New Deal period viewed as suspect.
\
A new generation of conservatives wants to bring the old order back under the auspices of what is called the Constitution in Exile movement.
\
Their driving idea is that the thrust of jurisprudence since the late 1930s voided the ""real"" Constitution.
\
As legal scholar Jeffrey Rosen noted in The New Republic, this movement favors ""reimposing meaningful limits on federal power that could strike at the core of the regulatory state for the first time since the New Deal."" He wrote that ""justices could change the shape of laws governing the environment, workplace health and safety, anti-discrimination, and civil rights, making it difficult for the federal government to address problems for which the public demands a national response.""
\
It's not hard to imagine the cases that conservatives would bring against laws passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by a President Barack Obama. Why wouldn't a movement that has tried to eviscerate wetlands laws and the Endangered Species Act challenge cap-and-trade legislation aimed at dealing with global warming?
\
If Congress ever passed a ""card-check"" law to make it easier for unions to organize, those who never much liked the minimum wage or collective bargaining would certainly try to overturn the new labor right in court.
\
And what would be the legal fate of new regulations on banking called forth by the economic devastation of the subprime mess, or bank bailouts that might be necessary to keep capitalism on track, or mandatory mortgage renegotiations to keep citizens from being thrown out of their homes?
\
The four conservatives on the Supreme Court, when empowered by the swing vote of Justice Anthony Kennedy, have already shown their willingness to overturn the will of Congress and local legislatures when doing so fits their political philosophy.
\
The same majority could keep conservative ideas in the saddle long after the electorate has decided that they don't work anymore.

54,"Global climate change poses a dangerous threat to our nation's economy and environment. Recent scientific studies show that global warming is already causing environmental changes that will have significant global economic and social impacts. Decisive federal action is needed now.\Very soon the U.S. Senate will take up America's Climate Security Act, S. 2191. This bill is a major step forward; it establishes a ""cap and trade"" plan that is needed to curtail emissions that cause climate change\Four critical areas need to be improved:\- Reduction goals must be based on the best science; cuts in greenhouse gas emissions must be larger and achieved more quickly.\- Economic efficiency is vital. Emission permits should be auctioned rather than being given away; the cap and trade system should not result in economic windfalls.\- Auction proceeds and regulatory policy should speed the transition to a clean-energy economy rather than subsidizing polluting industries.\- Fairness is needed. New mechanisms, including auction proceeds, must protect vulnerable groups and spur worldwide action.\In addition, weakening amendments, such as so-called ""safety valves"" and subsidies for mature energy technologies, should be vigorously opposed.\The League of Women Voters of Missouri urges Senators (Kit) Bond and (Claire) McCaskill to strengthen S. 2191 and oppose all weakening amendments to S. 2191 and to take strong action against climate change. A strong bill will help to move our nation toward an economically secure energy future.\Jo Sapp is president of the League of Women Voters of Missouri and lives in Columbia."
55,"Unless you want to consider a nuclear winter following an exchange of atomic weapons, mankind has had and will have little influence on global temperatures and climate change. Sure, we should be good stewards of the earth's resources and we know from experience that we can cause harm to the environment. We've been affecting the environment since we discovered fire. There are a lot of things we can do to reduce our negative impact on the planet, but controlling carbon dioxide emissions isn't one of them.\It is too bad that scientists have difficulty in explaining things in straight-forward terms that people can relate to easily. In his State of the Union address, the chief executive said evidence of climate change is overwhelming. It sure is; we have evidence of cyclical climate changes going back millions of years. But mankind is not causing climate change; the sun and the relationship of the earth to the sun are the causes of climate change. The earth itself has some impact. It wobbles in orbit which can change prevailing weather conditions at some locations like greening of deserts, expansion of deserts, melting of glaciers and polar ice packs, expansion of glaciers and polar ice packs. The earth also has volcanic activity which has certainly had an impact on local and global weather conditions, perhaps even the climate for thousands of years.\If you want to be a good steward of the planet, great. Recycle your garbage, turn off the lights when you're not using them, turn off the water while you're brushing your teeth or shaving. Maybe stop using an electric hair dryer. Instead of pouring concrete all over the place, plant some flowers, grass and trees. You could even walk, ride a bike or drive a hybrid car to get around. You would help the environment but you wouldn't have much of an impact on the weather or the climate and you never will.\That is the big problem with the hodgepodge energy bill (cap and trade). It contains some good proposals relative to increasing energy availability and reducing pollution but its basic premise is false. The false part is blaming mankind for generating too much carbon dioxide and causing the earth to heat up. This is just not true. We are, borrowing from ""Star Trek,"" carbon-based life forms. We generate carbon dioxide which the plants use to create more oxygen. The amount of carbon dioxide generated by mankind to include breathing and burning fossil fuels for power is miniscule compared to what Mother Nature generates from decomposition and volcanic activity.\So, here's the question. Who was the person, group or committee in the EPA that determined that carbon dioxide is a pollutant? And, how do we get that person, group or committee fired? I'm from Missouri; show me the overwhelming evidence that carbon dioxide generated by mankind is changing the climate.\Martin Capages, Jr lives in Springfield."
56,"WASHINGTON - This time a year ago, the proposal to build an experimental, expensive FutureGen coal power plant in Southern Illinois was struggling to survive. Now its backers see a bright future as proponents try to resurrect the plant from federal limbo.\The reasons: A new administration is calling for a revamped energy policy, and $3.4 billion in stimulus funds is set to flow to fossil fuel research.\By next month, backers hope to have $75 million to move the project forward. And the project received more good news Wednesday when the investigative arm of Congress testified before a House subcommittee that the Bush administration erred last year in halting progress on the plant.\""We are very optimistic about it,"" said FutureGen Alliance CEO Michael Mudd. ""We think the time is right, that the opportunity is right in Washington, so I think we have a very strong opportunity to get FutureGen back on the fast track and moving ahead.""\The Government Accountability Office said in its report that the Bush administration stopped FutureGen last year after making faulty estimates about the cost of the plant, expected to have almost no carbon emissions. Illinoisans in Congress have accused the Bush administration of backing out of the Illinois project because it triumphed in the competition for federal funds over a project in Bush's home state of Texas.\At the House Energy and Environment subcommittee hearing Wednesday, GAO official Mark Gaffigan said the Bush administration had overestimated FutureGen's costs and called its decision-making ""problematic."" One subcommittee member, Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Fort Washington, Md., called the administration's actions a ""second grade"" mistake.\However, Energy Secretary Steven Chu expressed fresh concerns about the plant's cost, which had been set at $1.8 billion last year. A new estimate for the project won't be known until backers contract with the U.S. Department of Energy and construction companies. When asked about the GAO report, Chu said the actual cost of FutureGen could still increase, possibly to as much as $2.3 billion.\Rep. Jerry Costello, D-Belleville, said the Bush administration had cost the project valuable time. ""The result is we lost at least a year and a half and perhaps more time to develop carbon capture and sequestration technologies,"" he said.\Still, Costello, a subcommittee member, called FutureGen shovel-ready, the kind of project that would qualify for federal stimulus funding designed to create jobs immediately. Victor Der, acting assistant secretary in the fossil energy office of the Department of Energy, agreed. Der said the FutureGen Alliance, a collection of energy companies that includes St. Louis-based Peabody Energy, will meet with Chu ""very soon.""\FutureGen was touted as the flagship of a federal effort to test technologies that would enable a coal plant to run with near-zero carbon emissions.\In December, the FutureGen Alliance bought the 400 acres for the site.\The $75 million that could be released by April will be spent on further design of the plant and completing contracts for construction, Mudd said. If that money comes through, he expects to have all federal funding restored by September, meaning construction would start next year.\One thing is sure: FutureGen is expensive. The tax revenue from a carbon cap-and-trade system, which President Barack Obama and many in Washington are calling for, could fund solutions in managing coal emissions, the panelists at the hearing agreed.\Although he has been an outspoken critic of carbon cap-and-trade, Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond, R-Mo., said plants like FutureGen will be needed to keep using coal as a fuel.\""Wind, solar and even the renewables are only going to be able to make a partial contribution to our future energy needs, which will continue to grow far beyond what we see right now,"" Bond said.\Others expressed concern that FutureGen would sink too much money into an unproven technology working in an unprecedented scale. Frank O'Donnell, president of the advocacy group Clean Air Watch, worries that FutureGen is a gamble by a government dealing with a sputtering economy.\""I'm not saying that we're opposed to the idea entirely, but I do think we're talking about something that could well be more than a billion dollars of taxpayer money and produces a white elephant,"" O'Donnell said. ""You have to wonder is that really the best way to spend a billion dollars.""\Credit: Sean Rose; St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
57,"ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS\ In his first term, President George W. Bush often seized on obscure rules outside the reach of Congress to change how the nation protects air, water and land.\ But with its ""Clear Skies"" plan, the White House must make its case to members of the House and Senate for scrapping portions of the Clean Air Act in favor of a new approach backed by utilities and the nation's coal industry.\ The president's plan spells out new air pollution rules governed by a ""cap and trade"" system that allows utilities to buy and sell rights to pollute within broad limits.\ The proposal calls for 70 percent reductions in several pollutants by 2018. But many health and environmental advocates argue that it weakens protections and delays improvements.\ Meanwhile, congressional Democrats and a few Republicans complain that it fails to begin controlling one of the world's most vexing pollutants -- carbon dioxide, which is the principal cause of global warming.\ With key votes looming in the Senate, the White House last week embarked on an aggressive campaign to persuade the skeptics.\ Jim Connaughton, the president's chief environmental adviser, said that he is spending half of his time to engineer passage of the plan this year.\ ""I need to be clear. We're not rolling back programs. We're literally expanding one that will guarantee (pollution) reductions and will give people like me and the new EPA administrator a better tool for enforcement,"" said Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.\ Connaughton, in an interview Friday, trumpeted the benefits of the White House plan for Midwestern utilities, the coal industry and farmers burdened by fertilizer costs due to price increases in natural gas. He also touted health benefits for the region.\ ""Are we going to create a future for clean coal?

58,"ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS\ In his first term, President George W. Bush often seized on obscure rules outside the reach of Congress to change how the nation protects air, water and land.\ But with its ""Clear Skies"" plan, the White House must make its case to members of the House and Senate for scrapping portions of the Clean Air Act in favor of a new approach backed by utilities and the nation's coal industry.\ The president's plan spells out new air pollution rules governed by a ""cap and trade"" system that allows utilities to buy and sell rights to pollute within broad limits.\ The proposal calls for 70 percent reductions in several pollutants by 2018. But many health and environmental advocates argue that it weakens protections and delays improvements.\ Meanwhile, congressional Democrats and a few Republicans complain that it fails to begin controlling one of the world's most vexing pollutants -- carbon dioxide, which is the principal cause of global warming.\ With key votes looming in the Senate, the White House last week embarked on an aggressive campaign to persuade the skeptics.\ Jim Connaughton, the president's chief environmental adviser, said that he is spending half of his time to engineer passage of the plan this year.\ ""I need to be clear. We're not rolling back programs. We're literally expanding one that will guarantee (pollution) reductions and will give people like me and the new EPA administrator a better tool for enforcement,"" said Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.\ Connaughton, in an interview Friday, trumpeted the benefits of the White House plan for Midwestern utilities, the coal industry and farmers burdened by fertilizer costs due to price increases in natural gas. He also touted health benefits for the region.\ ""For the first time, we will be able to get the pollution reductions we need without putting the burden on the backs of manufacturers,"" he said, while noting that utilities would be spending $50 billion for pollution control equipment under the plan.\ State controls\ In the wake of broad skepticism toward the proposal, Senate sponsors added a provision last week allowing states to make air pollution rules tougher than the federal government if they choose.\ But S.

59,"Legal reform might get push from new leadership\The 2008 election is in the books and for the most part last Tuesday was a fairly good day for incumbents because the balance of power in both the Illinois House and Senate did not change.\But moving forward there will be some different individuals serving in important leadership roles in the legislature because both parties in the Illinois Senate will soon be electing new legislative leaders. This change in leadership could have significant implications in legislative priorities, at least as far as the Illinois Senate is concerned.\One priority that is often ignored is the need for meaningful legal reform in Illinois. In recent years, common-sense legal reforms have hit a stone wall in the Illinois Senate. So as Illinois' senators select the next leaders of their respective parties, they should consider where the various candidates for these leadership roles stand on civil justice issues.\After all, according to a recent report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Harris Interactive, Illinois is the fifth worst state in the nation for legal fairness. Directorship magazine and the American Justice Partnership Foundation's 2008 Boardroom Guide to State Litigation Climates rank Illinois' litigation climate dead last in the country.\Clearly, Illinois needs legal reform, but if our lawmakers do not hear from us, they will not act. It is time for concerned citizens to get involved at the grass-roots level to bring common sense back to our courts.

Certainly changes are needed over that time, but throwing the whole thing out and starting from scratch simply provides the opportunity to insert a few ignominious provisions among some bait in a single package that would have to be voted up or down as a whole.\This is unnecessary.

Smith\Springfield\Time to act in effort to combat global warming\Recently, Environment Illinois released ""Feeling The Heat: Global Warming and Rising Temperatures in the United States."" According to this report, 2007 tied for the second warmest year on record globally and was the 10th warmest year on record in the United States. Locally, the 2007 average temperature was 2 degrees above normal (the 1971-2000 average) in Springfield.\This is part of a national warming trend: Between 2000 and 2007, the average temperature was 1.1 degrees above normal in Springfield.\Nationally, the average temperature during this period was at least 0.5 degrees above normal at nearly 90 percent of the 255 weather stations from which data was collected.\The message of the report is clear: Temperatures continue to rise here and across the country, and the time for action on global warming has arrived. We can start with the following steps:\* First, we must cap greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, the United States must reduce its global warming pollution by at least 20 percent by 2020 and by 80 percent by 2050. A cap-and-trade system, supported by both presidential candidates, must be a top priority for the next administration.\* We must also make massive improvements in energy efficiency -- which will save families and businesses hundreds of dollars a year on utility bills. This means providing financial incentives for moving to energy-efficient products and technologies -- a significantly cheaper, cleaner and faster solution for addressing energy demand than building new power plants.\* And we must make accelerated development of renewable energy the centerpiece of our economic development policies. Our manufacturing sector of tomorrow is dependent on providing a climate for rapid growth of these industries today.\These solutions will not only help save our environment, they will recharge our sagging economy. The time to act is now.\Brian P. Granahan\Environment Illinois\Chicago\Tuesday was a great day for all Americans\As of Tuesday night, I have never been more proud to be an American.

60,"News-Leader\In late spring, 100 turbines at the state's fourth wind farm in northwest Missouri will start going online, almost doubling the output of the other three farms combined.\The electricity will flow across the grid to the customers of Springfield-based Associated Electric Cooperative Inc., which serves 51 cooperatives across rural Missouri, Iowa and Oklahoma.\But after 2013, the wind-generated power likely won't flow into homes and businesses in Cabool, Mansfield, Waynesville and a dozen other small communities across southern Missouri.\Marshfield-based Sho-Me Power sent notices to the 15 communities in December saying it can no longer sell them electricity after Christmas of 2013 on a long-term basis.\""Getting electricity to our co-ops is our priority; that's who owns us,"" said Jerry Hartman, manager of administrative services for Sho-Me Power.\Associated Electric, which sells power wholesale to Sho-Me Power, is scaling back on selling electricity to municipal utilities because of an uncertain future in generating additional energy, said spokeswoman Nancy Southworth.\Proposals in Congress to rein in carbon dioxide emissions believed to be contributing to man-made global climate change have brought any plans to build or invest in new coal-burning power plants to a halt.\""Looking 20 years out, it gets very difficult to do that in today's environment,"" Hartman said. ""It's an uncertain future on coal and it takes a few years to build (a plant).""\The clean energy legislation, known as cap and trade, passed the U.S. House last summer but remains held up in the Senate as lawmakers weigh the benefits against possible job losses.\Higher costs\Although the new wind farm in DeKalb County will increase the percentage of power Associated Electric gets from wind from 1 percent to 4 percent, it won't be enough for sustainable growth into the future.\""It would take a lot more wind turbines ... to ever come close"" to the demand, Southworth said.\Plus, burning fossil fuels remains less expensive for generating cheap electricity than alternative energy sources. The cap-and-trade legislation in Congress would dedicate more federal subsidies to developing alternative energy sources while making it more costly to burn coal for electricity generation.\While the source of wind power is free, wind and other alternative energy sources ""cannot produce electricity that can be sold at reasonable rates, especially with carbon legislation pending in Congress,"" according to a Dec. 28 letter Sho-Me Power sent to the city of Houston.\In March 2008, Associated Electric suspended indefinitely plans to build a new 660-megawatt coal-fired power plant near Norborne after cost estimates reached $2 billion and financing dried up. Increased environmental regulation also was cited as a factor in all but abandoning the project.\Sho-Me Power said it was exercising a termination clause in its contract that called for three years advance notice. Without doing so, the power cooperative would have had to continue supplying power to Houston until 2033, according to a copy of the letter obtained by the News-Leader.\But losing Sho-Me Power will likely result in higher electricity rates from wholesale suppliers in other parts of Missouri or out-of-state, officials said.\""What I can see as the biggest detriment to the city is our power costs will -- I'm sure -- be much higher,"" said Larry Sutton, city administrator for Houston.\Since Sho-Me Power still owns the power lines that run into the 15 cities, the municipalities will have to pay Sho-Me for transmission costs as well.\""Sho-Me is going to make money on it, even if they don't sell us anything,"" Sutton said.\Changing suppliers\Sho-Me Power's existing nine cooperatives across southern Missouri will not accept any of the municipalities into their systems, Hartman said.\State Sen. Frank Barnitz, a Dent County Democrat, is organizing a meeting next week of officials from affected towns to assess their options for new power sources.\""Even though we've got three years before the actual termination date of this, three years can creep up on you real quickly,"" said Alan Clark, city administrator for St. Robert. ""We've got to find an energy supplier that's going to give us some economical rates for our residents.""\St. Robert and Waynesville are among the affected communities. Fort Leonard Wood purchases electricity from Sho-Me Power but is involved in a separate contract and exempted from the shut-off notices, Hartman said.\Clark worries that even the perception of St. Robert not having a long-term power supplier could hurt the growing Pulaski County community's economic development.\""The last thing I want to do is have a developer think he's not going to have electric power because of the situation with Sho-Me right now,"" Clark said.\One source of power for the 12 communities is a cooperative setup, managed by the Missouri Association of Municipal Utilities.\In its 10th year, the Missouri Public Energy Pool has 35 cities -- including Rolla -- that pool resources and invest in generating facilities in Missouri, Illinois and Arkansas, said Ewell Lawson, a lobbyist for the state's municipal utilities.\Ava recently stopped buying power from Sho-Me Power in favor of joining MOPEP, and Lebanon is scheduled to switch to MOPEP on April 1, Lawson said.\Lebanon decided to switch before getting an expected shut-off notice from Sho-Me Power, said Kevin Barber, electric department supervisor for city of Lebanon.\""They weren't telling us they were going to kick us off the system, but they hinted to us that we should start looking,"" Barber said.\The cities also could pool resources and negotiate for bulk power on their own, Barnitz said.\Barnitz said Associated Electric's inability to continue serving the municipalities shines light on the state's lack of a long-term and affordable energy source if burning coal is discouraged because of the high levels of pollution emitted.\""You're up against the environmental crowd that is just hellbent against any coal,"" Barnitz said. ""We have to look at it from a standpoint of reliability of power.""\Towns affected\Sho-Me Power Electric Cooperative in Marshfield plans to stop selling electricity to the following Missouri cities after 2013:\- Cabool\- Cuba\- Houston\- Mansfield\- Mountain View\- Newburg\- Richland\- Salem\- Seymour\- St. Robert\- Steelville\- Sullivan\- Waynesville\- Willow Springs\- Winona"
61," Weather warnings\ Rising temperatures and increasingly violent storms are called likely.\ Politicians scramble\ Curbs on fossil fuels may hurt industry, they say.\ ---\ By 2030, Illinois will feel like Arkansas now with longer and hotter summers - but with more storms and unpredictable weather, climate researchers predict. By the end of the century, parts of the Midwest could be as steamy as Texas today.\ ""One thing we clearly know is that it will be a whole lot warmer, and the rainstorms probably not as gentle as when I was growing up on a farm in Carlyle, Ill.,"" said Donald Wuebbles, a climate researcher and director of the Director of School of Earth, Society and the Environment at the University of Illinois.\ Wuebbles and other scientists will tune in this week for the release of a new international study that is expected to make the strongest link yet between the burning of fossil fuels and global warming.\ The report will arrive on the heels of key developments in Washington that appear to build momentum for a national plan to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases. But despite a new push by congressional leaders and even a nod to the issue by President George W. Bush, big battles are brewing, with powerful politicians likely to resist dramatic changes that would pain their constituents.\ This week's study comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the main international body studying the issue. It represents the latest thinking from more than 2,000 of the world's leading scientists in what is billed as the largest scientific analysis of peer-reviewed literature ever. The report will analyze how the climate has changed over centuries and predict how it will change in the future.\ Sources familiar with the study said last week that it would conclude that there was roughly a 90 percent certainty that most of the planet's warming since the mid-20th century could be traced to human activities. ""Mild winters or the lack of winter, melting glaciers - these are the things that get people's attention and are driving the political system,"" said Vicky Arroyo, director of policy analysis at the nonpartisan Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Washington.\ Pushing back\ The new report will be embraced by some in Congress as further evidence of the need for mandatory limits on emissions from factories and cars, a highly contentious goal that will draw opposition from members with coal, oil and automotive interests in their districts.\ An example is Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., a member of the House Energy Committee. Shimkus said he would be looking for allies in both parties to help prevent undue damage to the Illinois coal industry.\ ""There were communities in Southern Illinois devastated by the Clean Air Act,"" he asserted. An aide to Shimkus later cited Pinckneyville as one of the Illinois towns that suffered because of a downturn in the coal industry that followed Clean Air Act amendments aimed at reducing the use of high-sulfur coal.\ ""The public as a whole thinks we ought to start addressing this issue, and you don't want to be the guy who blocks it,"" Shimkus said. ""But we need to ensure that as we move to address the global warming debate that we don't react so strongly that we shut down industries.""\ The movement toward a full-fledged congressional debate, dormant as recently as late last year, picked up steam last week when an alliance of U.S. corporate leaders gathered in Washington to declare their support for new air pollution limits and a ""cap-and-trade"" system giving industries flexibility to comply. Under cap-and- trade, companies have the right to buy and sell pollution rights within an overall limit decreasing over time.\ The CEOs represented 10 companies that produce a host of products from heavy equipment to chemicals to electricity. They concluded that the scientific evidence about climate change and its causes was sound and that their industries needed to make investments now to prepare for what was described as a ""carbon-constrained"" future.\ The executives said they expected their alliance to grow, and they were right: They won an early and significant endorsement of Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer.\ Acid-rain parallel\ Bush has been skeptical of the link between rising planet temperatures and the burning of fossil fuels. But in his State of the Union address last week, he referred to ""the serious challenge of global climate change.""\ Bush's main focus was energy security and reducing dependence on foreign oil. He proposed using more ethanol and promoting fuel efficiency to reduce gasoline consumption by 20 percent in 10 years, a goal that also addresses climate change.\ Even though the president did not embrace carbon emission limits or broader solutions, climate-change experts viewed his statement as another breakthrough.\ ""It is clear that the country is moving rapidly to some sort of national greenhouse gas emissions regimen, a dramatic shift accelerated by both the science and the elections,"" said Philip Sharp, president of Resources for the Future, a think tank in Washington.\ Sharp, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana, says the battles shaping up now over global warming are similar to those in the late 1980s over acid rain.\ In the years after President Ronald Reagan's infamous assertion that ""trees cause more pollution than automobiles,"" Republicans and Democrats alike embraced the movement to reduce sulfur dioxide - a pollutant from coal and oil and a main source of acid rain. Similarly, 2008 White House hopefuls in both major political parties are promising to aggressively fight global warming.\ The issue became a protracted battle in Congress that pitted regions of the country against one another and split the Democratic Party, in control of Congress much of the time.\ Then as now, Sharp recalled, the issue of how to limit damage to coal-producing areas was one of the toughest to deal with.\ Tipping point?\ This year, signs of discord and turf battles are already appearing.\ Some House Energy Committee members, for example, don't like Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement earlier this month that a new Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming would play a role in legislation.\ ""There's a lot of dissension,"" Shimkus said, referring to committee members' concerns about the special panel. Pelosi, D- Calif., has said that it will not encroach on the Energy Committee.\ Phil Clapp, a former congressional staff member and president of the National Environmental Trust, an advocacy group based in Washington, said the chances of reaching agreement were enhanced by the strong environmental credentials of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.\ Clapp said he was convinced that many Republicans, like the Democrats who now run Congress, were eager for an agreement.\ ""Where we are is that public and congressional leadership have reached a consensus and major business leaders have gone public saying that we want action now,"" he said. ""We have reached the tipping point.""\ ---\ Do you believe the climate is changing? What can be done about it? Talk about it in Current Affairs.

62," Mississippi River pollution is just one of the environmental issues Democrats say they will address in A greener Congress\ With a thin edge in Congress, Democrats will hold hearings, but they may be unable to make major changes.\ ---\ Deadly chemical runoff and suffocating loads of sediment plague the Mississippi River, and the governors of Missouri, Illinois and three other states in the river basin want an accounting of the problem.\ A bill in Congress would do just that, and now that Democrats have taken control, it could speed to passage.\ ""The Congress is definitely a deeper shade of green after these elections,"" said Melinda Pierce, a Sierra Club lobbyist.\ The Mississippi River bill has a modest price tag and focuses on a regional problem. It's one type of narrower environmental initiative that Democrats will probably seek to guide through when they take control of Congress in January 4. But Democratic leaders are setting their sights higher as weel, promising major policy shifts including:\ - Repealing tax subsidies for big oil companies and investing those dollars in renewable energy technology;\ - Curbing greenhouse gases and other emissions that contribute to global warming;\ - Speeding the cleanup of toxic waste dumps.\ But ambitious efforts may get only so far. Pierce said it wouldn't be easy for major pieces of environmental legislation to make it across the finish line.\ She added: ""The more general tenor is: We're not going to be playing defense anymore and then a slow shift toward knocking off some of these good, forward-thinking energy proposals.""\ New committee heads\ With Democrats in power, the way Congress approaches environmental and energy policies could flip 180 degrees, congressional observers said.\ For example, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who will chair the Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works, has promised major policy change to curb emissions that spur global warming. She takes the place of Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., who once called global warming ""the greatest hoax perpetrated on the American people.""\ And voters ousted Rep. Richard Pombo, R-Calif., chairman of the House Resources Committee. He was virulently opposed by major environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters, for pushing anti-environment initiatives and attempting to weaken the Endangered Species Act.\ ""It's ripe for change in a broad range of areas,"" said Nat Mund, the league's deputy legislative director. ""We're looking at a different set of solutions who will be more focused on protecting natural resources than exploiting them.""\ Pierce advised Democrats to start a dialogue about overarching issues, such as global warming, while passing smaller, ""less-sexy"" initiatives that begin to address those broader problems.\ ""We'll be setting the agenda and picking off wins, in the meantime, until 2009,"" when a new president takes office, she said.\ But even when that happens, Democrats still may find it tough to pass major environmental policies, said Bill Kovacs, vice president of environment and regulatory affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\ ""That doesn't mean they're not going to have oversight hearings,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean there isn't going to be sound and fury. But I'm betting it'll be very difficult to get anything through.\ ""It's sorta like the old story of, what does the dog do when he catches the car? Do you really want to be the party that pushes through, let's say, a cap-and-trade system for CO2 and limit the amount of energy the country can use?""\ He was referring to a proposal to regulate greenhouse gases.\ ""I'm not sure you do,"" he said. ""I think the voters would clobber them.""\ 'Dead zone'\ The Mississippi River basin bill aims to protect the river all the way to the Gulf of Mexico, where a ""dead zone"" of oxygen- impaired ocean has grown to roughly the size of New Jersey.\ Much of the chemical waste in that ""dead zone"" originates in the river's upper basin, which includes Missouri and Illinois and its river main systems. But few broad-based attempts have been made to examine and quantify the problems with chemicals and sediment draining into the Mississippi.\ Under the bill, the U.S. Geological Survey would get $63 million over a decade to collect data and create computer models so scientists can pinpoint the primary sources of such runoff.\ ""This is something that's been around for quite some time,"" said Larry Shepard, an EPA official who monitors the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. ""Really, it's been kind of a bogeyman that people aren't anxious to get after.""\ That's partly because possible solutions would require cooperation and coordination between all levels of government, as well as agriculture, industry and other private businesses in multiple states. It could also involve fundamental changes in how farms and businesses operate.\ Rep. Ron Kind, the bill's sponsor, called sediment and chemical runoff issues ""the greatest threat"" facing the Mississippi River. He'd like to win final approval for the legislation before Christmas, but he might have to wait until next year.\ ""In order to achieve maximum buy-in on what needs to be done, it has to be based on sound science. You can't have someone coming in speculating what the problem is and then expect people to hop on board,"" said Kind, D-Wis.\ But that's not to say that many scientists don't already suspect where most runoff comes from.\ Industries can contribute; wastewater treatment plants in cities such as St. Louis and Memphis, Tenn., have discharged significant loads of chemicals into the river on occasion, Shepard said. But he and others pointed to farming as the primary source of extra nitrogen and phosphorus in the river basin.\ While certain amounts of both chemicals are necessary for aquatic life to exist, runoff spikes the river with deadly chemical levels that can kill marine life or animals that drink the water, and harm public water supplies, according to the USGS. Sediment runoff can bury the river's habitats and clog up shipping lanes.\ Incentives in government programs encourage farmers to produce as many bushels per acre as possible, often prompting them to pump more fertilizers nto their crops to ensure a larger harvest, said Russ Kremer, president of the Missouri Farmers Union. Phosphorus and nitrogen are two of the three main fertilizers farmers apply each spring, a time of year where heavier rains typically produce more runoff.\ ""It's something I think is long-overdue as far as studying, 'What is the effect of intensive agriculture systems?'"" said Kremer, a livestock farmer in Osage County. ""We've never had adequate enough information about that.""\ Shepard said the data collection and resulting computer models would go a long way toward convincingly demonstrating that chemical and sediment runoff are real issues with damaging consequences.\ ""This bill is intended to at least provide enough information that would allow us to get past that impediment and at least identify the hotspots,"" he said.\ ---\ In play\ Within their first 100 hours in control of Congress, Democrats have pledged to roll back tax subsidies for big oil companies and invest that money in renewable energy sources. Here's a list of other long-stalled initiatives that may have new life\ Clean Water Authority Restoration Act\ Primary goal: Clarify and strengthen the scope of the 1972 Clean Water Act. Democrats say the White House and Supreme Court have whittled away some of its powers through misinterpretations.\ Status: The bill has some bipartisan support, but it has been stuck in House and Senate committees since last year.\  Safe Climate Act\ Primary goal: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Beginning in 2011, the U.S. would have to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2 percent each year, so that emissions levels in 2020 don't exceed what they were in 1990.\ Status: No action since being introduced and placed in a House subcommittee in June. No similar measure exists in the Senate.\ Future Fuels Act\ Primary goal: Reduce America's dependence on oil and boost the country's ability to produce alternative fuels.\ Status: No action since being referred to a House subcommittee in January.\ Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act\ Primary goal: Amend the Clean Air Act to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from sources including cars and generators. The bill calls for emissions levels in 2050 to be 20 percent of what they were in 1990, mirroring a current initiative in California.\ Status: No action since being referred to a Senate committee in July.\ Renewable Energy Investment Act\ Primary goal: Change federal rules to create a renewable energy credit program for utilities companies.\ Status: No action since being introduced and placed in a Senate committee in February 2005.\ Clean Power Act\ Primary goal: Reduce emissions from electric power plants.\ Status: No action since being referred to a Senate committee in January 2005. A similar measure in the House has remained in a subcommittee since March 2005."
63,"Climate change's serious threat demands action now from U.S. Senate\Global climate change poses a dangerous threat to our nation's economy and environment. Recent scientific studies show that global warming already is causing environmental changes that will have significant global economic and social impacts. Decisive federal action is needed now.\Very soon, the U.S. Senate will take up America's Climate Security Act, SB 2191. This bill is a major step forward. It establishes a cap-and-trade plan that is needed to curtail emissions that cause climate change. Still, four critical areas need to be improved:\- Reduction goals must be based on the best science; cuts in greenhouse gas emissions must be larger and achieved more quickly.\- Economic efficiency is vital. Emission permits should be auctioned off rather than given away; the cap-and-trade system should not result in economic windfalls to businesses.\- Auction proceeds and regulatory policy should speed the transition to a clean-energy economy, rather than subsidize polluting industries. \- Fairness is needed. New mechanisms, including auction proceeds, must protect vulnerable groups and spur world-wide action.\In addition, weakening amendments, such as so-called safety valves and subsidies for mature energy technologies should be opposed vigorously. \The League of Women Voters of Missouri urges Missouri Sens. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond and Claire McCaskill to strengthen SB 2191, oppose all weakening amendments and to take strong action against climate change. \A strong bill would help move our nation toward an economically secure energy future.\Jo Sapp | Columbia, Mo.\President, League of Women Voters of Missouri \Stay right and pray\The installation of the variable speed limit signs on Interstate 270 is ridiculous. Anyone who drives on I-270 knows that no one pays any attention to posted speed limits. Those who do must believe that the posted speed limit is a speed minimum.\In reality, posted speed limits are enforced only once in awhile, so the ""crazies"" still will ignore the ""blinkers"" and go their merry way in a 70-mph dash to get home with a little weaving in and out to keep us all alert. The only way to control I-270 would be to have police cars stationed every mile of the highway, but that never will happen for lack of funds.\My advice to drivers on I-270 is to stay in the slow lane and pray.\Bill Bandle | Manchester\Lucky, but still behind \Regarding ""The danger of seeing women as victims"" (May 29): Women as victims! What a revolutionary thought. Columnist Z. Dwight Billingsly states: ""It is more challenging to develop public policies that encourage citizens, including women, to take the initiative to help themselves."" Well, Lily Ledbetter took the initiative, and the men on the U.S. Supreme Court denied her right to equal pay for equal work. Ms. Ledbetter does not see herself as a victim, merely a hardworking citizen claiming her equal rights as a human being and dedicated employee.\I am certain that Hillary Clinton does not see herself as a victim when she points out that the luckiest women in the world - American women - make only 77 cents for every dollar American men earn. It is a fact. Are we to ignore the facts and concentrate on Phyllis Schlafly's luckiest women in the world? How has Ms. Schlafly's work helped women?\Women can take the initiative to help themselves and can make their own decisions. What they don't need is legislation to rob them of equal pay for equal work or the government making health decisions for them. Does Mr. Billingsly think of the suffragettes as victims? Without them, women would not be voting.\Geraldine Jacobs | St. Charles\So, Bidwell was right\With the Rams' possible sale and the status of the Edward Jones Dome in question, St. Louis would do well to get ahead of the curve for a change. First, we must decide what a National Football League team is worth to St. Louis and how much we are willing to invest. Assuming we decide that an NFL team is worth keeping, we should ask the Rams if their ultimate goal is to have a new new stadium. If so, we should invest very little in upgrades to the existing dome and start working on a long-term plan to get a new stadium in place near the end of their current lease. \Perhaps the best place for a new stadium would be at Riverport, where we could build an open-air football stadium and concert venue to replace Verizon Amphitheater. Then the convention center dome could be used year-round for conventions, while the new stadium could be used for football, concerts and even professional soccer. Parking fees alone could be enough to finance a significant portion of this project.\Who would have thought that Bill Bidwell was right all along?\Jim Schmitz | St. Louis\Cost-benefit analysis\Before discussions continue about the ""need"" for a new football dome, a simple cost-benefit analysis of the Rams staying in St. Louis must be done. The numbers during their history here are fresh enough to make a simple up-or-down judgment on whether they have produced enough income to justify a new stadium.\Skipping the silly intangibles that are used to sell this - we must be a ""major-league city"" - figuring out if the Rams improved conditions financially for the area would answer all the questions.\If the Rams have brought in enough money through tourism, business and taxes, perhaps an upgrade would be in order. If not, then the concept falls flat. To seek taxpayer dollars for a proposed replacement, the Rams, just like any business, must justify their contribution through the documentation of real jobs and real dollars to the community. \Kevin Fitzpatrick | Florissant\Highlighting the exception\I was disappointed with the Post-Dispatch's choice of photos to print with the story of the 2008 graduation ceremony of the U.S. Air Force Academy (""Bush compares Islamic extremists to facists,"" May 29).\Of the 1,000 graduates who showed respect for their president and commander-in-chief, their uniform and their own status as 2nd Lieutenants in the Air Force, the Post-Dispatch chose to picture the exception. \Dorothy A. Smith | Florissant\Only one man's view\The irrational feeding frenzy of the far left in the wake of former White House press secretary Scott McClellan's new book could not be better illustrated than in the response of MSNBC's Keith Olbermann on May 29. Mr. McClellan appeared to be the only one who denigrated President George W. Bush's character among his inner circle. Without exception, the rest of those people in Mr. Bush's inner circle (perhaps a dozen or more) were shocked and surprised. This was not the president they knew, and it was not the Scott McClellan they knew. To them, the president was wise, thorough, patient, respectful and considerate of all counsel, quite the opposite of McClellan's charges. But to Mr. Olbermann, the verdict was clear: Impeach the president! \Apparently, Mr. Olbermann's approach is simple: Count the sources and do the math - backward.\Larry P. Egley | St. Peters\Honesty in office\Big thanks to former White House press secretary Scott McClellan for having the courage to tell the truth about Iraq. Not only did he state that the invasion of Iraq was a serious error, but he also said that President George W. Bush and his loyalists lied their way into this military mess.\In response, Mr. Bush and his people said they were curious about why Mr. McClellan never shared his concerns while he was working at the White House. Are they fools? Former Secretary of State Colin Powell tried to tell Mr. Bush that invading Iraq was a bad idea, and he was shoved aside.\The last seven years have been one misstatement after another from Mr. Bush. This November, please let us elect someone who is honest and with great intellect.\Don Young | Florissant\Closer look\Valid or not, doubt lingers over the 2004 presidential election returns in Ohio, a state that ultimately went Republican red for President George W.

64,"News-Leader\Voters will be seeing a lot of Secretary of State Robin Carnahan this year.\That's because she's running for the U.S. Senate seat held by longtime Sen. Kit Bond, who is retiring at the end of this year.\Carnahan, a Democrat from Rolla, recently sat down with the Springfield News-Leader Editorial Board to discuss her views on several federal issues and her likely Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Springfield.\The following are excerpts of Carnahan's answers to the newspaper's questions:\Blunt Assessment\SNL: What do you think of Roy Blunt as a person?\CARNAHAN: Well, I don't know him well enough to know what's in his heart. I know him as somebody that I've visited with about public policy issues, and so that's why I talk about him in this way.\I know what he's accomplished, and when he was in the Secretary of State's office he did some good things.\Quite frankly, I think that in his time in Washington, he's sorta been co-opted by what goes on in Washington. I think he's a different person than he was when he was living in Missouri, and sometimes that happens to folks who stay out there too long. And from where I sit, here in Missouri, we could use somebody who's representing us and not somebody who's part of that club in Washington and somebody who seems to do a lot of back scratching.\Guantanamo Bay and Terrorism\SNL: Should the U.S. keep Guantanamo Bay open, or do you want to see it closed, and secondly, do you support the New York trial of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed?\CARNAHAN: The Guantanamo Bay issue is one that we really need to get past. It has been used according to military experts, as a recruiting tool to get more terrorists to attack us, and so we need to do things that reflect our values. One of those is not to have these kind of off-shore prisons. ... With respect to the trial in New York, I actually believe in military tribunals. I think we have that system for a reason, and to me, I don't understand why we're not trying Sheik Muhammad in a military tribunal, and I think that would be an appropriate place to try him.\Cap-and-Trade\SNL: Do you support the cap-and-trade bill as it stands right now?\CARNAHAN: Well, there's no proposal in the Senate at the moment on this. I think it's been one of these issues that's gotten beholden to the political sphere and turned all upside down. The way I think about this issue is actually a little bit different.\From what I see here in Missouri, this is a broader energy issue that you need to be talking about. And there is no doubt that our current energy policy is a threat to our national security and a threat to our economic security. There's just no question about that, and to turn that into a squabble in Washington makes me crazy.\I was this week with veterans. It was a group of folks who have been in Afghanistan and Iraq, and they were talking about how they spent time actually having to protect fuel convoys, mile-long fuel convoys going through the deserts of Iraq ... They said it was at that moment that they saw how vulnerable we were even in our military to the need for foreign oil.\They said to me, ""We're financing both sides of this war. ""\If you think about it -- every time you go to the gas tank and put gas in our car, we're sending 1.2 billion dollars every day, 1.2 billion everyday, that we send out of the United States to foreign countries, most of which don't like us.\At least some of that money gets turned back into terrorist training camps, to pay for road-side bombs and everything else. This is what the veterans are saying and they think it's crazy. ... And so, we know this.\We also know that it hurts our economic security. We saw this last time when oil prices spiked.\You know, I still run the family cattle farm. I saw the impact this had on farmers: fertilizer prices went up, corn prices went up, diesel prices went up.\And guess what?\Your commodity price at the end of the day doesn't go up, so everybody's getting squeezed. That's the same with small businesses that have utility bills go up. ... So we've got a real problem here.\Health care reform\SNL: Why should every American be required to carry health insurance?""\CARNAHAN: Well, I think ... my guess is that's off the table at the moment given the new environment that's going on out there. ...\It's not something that I think is a great idea that you require this of folks. I think that in the end it's better to give people incentives to do things than it is to be punitive in doing things. I think that just works better. ...\I tend to like incentives better than punitive measures, but with respect to health care, I will tell you that this is another one of those issues where it's not a partisan issue, it affects every single family, every small business, certainly our long-term economic future of our country in every state. And yet it just turned into this big partisan fight, and I don't think it needs to be. ...\Wall Street reform\SNL: What are some specific reforms in Washington that you think are feasible and that would solve the problems that caused this economic crisis?\CARNAHAN: Well, the first thing that we've gotta do is do financial regulatory reform. ... One of the things we've done is as a state securities regulator, ... so if there's a problem with a big financial institution, folks come to us.\And I'll tell you, since the folks in Washington decided to wash their hands of their responsibility to regulate, we've had a lot more to do, and I'm proud that we've been able to get tens of billions of dollars back for people that really needed it from financial institutions that have taken advantage of them. But in Washington what they need to do, number one, is make sure that these banks pay back their TARP money, bailout money.\Number two, we need to have real regulation again. They got rid of Glass-Steagall, which was the thing that separated the activities of investment banks and commercial banks, and some of the other institutions. We need to put some restrictions back in that to divide what the responsibilities are, what they don't co-mingle ... for all these funds to put the whole economy at risk when they make bad bets.\We also need to try to get this, solve this, ""too big to fail"" problem.\I mean, when did that happen in America that all of a sudden we're the free market beacon of the world, but when these guys who've been out there making all this money fail, and make bad bets, that we have to bail them out? OK, so we need to change this too big to fail mentality, and part of that is to get the size of these banks back down to normal so that they can fail if they take bad bets and have to take responsibility for their own actions.\I think we need to do something to change incentives in the pay structure, so there's not an incentive for these guys to take irresponsible actions, and so there's a lot that can be done that hasn't been, and it's appropriate.\Grading president Obama\SNL: What has been President Barack Obama's biggest mistake during his first year in office?\CARNAHAN: Well, I bet you can guess what I think his biggest mistake is and that's not focusing enough on the economy and focusing enough on reining in these problems on Wall Street. And again, it's not about being punitive.\It's about making sure there's fairness and we get our money back, and two, it's about making sure it doesn't happen again. I mean there hasn't been anything that's been done since the financial crisis to prevent the exact same thing from happening. I think that's a failure.\SNL: How about his greatest moment or greatest victory?\CARNAHAN: Well, I think there are a number of good things that he's done moving towards Iraq, getting our troops out of there and refocusing on Afghanistan where I think the real threat lies. That was a very difficult but important step for the country to take. So I think that's very significant.\I think stabilizing the complete meltdown that was going on in the economy was also a significant accomplishment.\I think when we took over last year the conversations in the articles, if you look back in your paper, were about a total economic collapse.\And so the fact that we're past that and getting to talk about other things, I think, is a huge accomplishment to have stabilized the world's banking system in a time that that was very important to do.\Stimulus spending\SNL: How would you change the economic stimulus program?\CARNAHAN: To me, I think there could be a way to focus it more on small business job creation because we know in the end that government is not where jobs get created.\Jobs get created by small businesses. That's what's the driver of our economy, certainly in Missouri.\And so we need to figure out if some of that money can be spent to do things to help small businesses create jobs. We're talking about a few programs in that way.\One is the job creation tax credit. Another is reducing the payroll taxes for some period of time.\Others are getting some kind of an R & D tax credit, so I think it would be appropriate to focus more on small business job creation.\Earmarks\SNL: Regarding earmarks, should you win this seat, will you approach earmarks differently than Senator Bond?\CARNAHAN: I will.\I think the earmark system needs to be completely changed and reformed and scrapped. Let's use the word scrapped, because the only people who really like earmarks are the politicians who give them out and the lobbyist who've figured out how to get them.\For everyone else, it doesn't make a lot of sense that there's not a lot of merit or competition as to how we use state tax dollars or national, federal tax dollars.\To me, it seems like if it's a worthy project, you ought to be able to compete for that money, and it ought not just be the largess of some politician...\Education reform\SNL: What do you think about No Child Left Behind?\CARNAHAN: Look, No Child Left Behind, the original goal was great -- to improve our schools.\The problem is the implementation hasn't sort of been realistic, and it has encouraged folks to teach to the test. It's been discouraging for teachers and not great for students.\And so what you've got to do is come up with a program that looks at real progress in other ways besides just this one test to reward schools and reward students for these things, and reward teachers.\And so it needs, we need to keep the notion that we want to do all we can to expand excellence in our schools, but we need to do it in a way that is not just rote memorization about things. ... We need to teach kids that they're gonna need creativity ... you know, the rest of the world has caught up with us on what was once a uniquely American value, which is that of education and higher education.\We need to understand that we're competing with the world on this. It's time that we be smart, and that it's not about how much you can memorize something that's going to be on the test.\It's about what really can create the new energy, alternative energies of the future or a breakthrough for cancer, and that takes a different kind of teaching.\energy\SNL: Do you think this country should still build coal plants?\CARNAHAN: Well, there's undoubtedly going to be more coal plants built because this transition into a new energy economy isn't going to happen over night.\The question is whether all the incentives just go to the same old carbon-based fuels and carbon-based systems that we've had in the past, or whether we understand that we're in a transition time, and ... moving toward this new energy economy.\It really is going to be our future. So it's not something that you just flip the switch or snap your fingers and you can make change.\There's going to be a transition time, so undoubtedly there's going to be more plants built. And undoubtedly as they build those, they should try to build them in a more efficient way."
65,"ST. LOUIS - U.S. Rep. Russ Carnahan doesn't have to go far to find signs that he's in a tough race.\Yard signs all across his district carry the name of his Republican rival, Ed Martin. Even at a feel-good event in Jefferson County - groundbreaking for a fire station receiving federal stimulus dollars - the Democrat's car pulled up behind two cars with Martin bumper stickers. \Such a Republican campaign presence once would have been unthinkable in the district Richard Gephardt, the former House Majority Leader and Democratic presidential candidate, held for more than 25 years.\This campaign season, however, is unlike any Carnahan has faced. All over the country, incumbents in what were considered safe Democratic seats are now sweating re-election as voters grow increasingly frustrated by a sluggish economy. \In Martin, Carnahan faces a candidate who is, in many ways, his polar opposite. Not only are the two far apart on key issues - health care, government spending, abortion - Martin's combative style offers a contrast to the even-keeled Carnahan.\Martin's presence in the race for the 3rd District, which runs from St. Louis to Jefferson County, has forced Carnahan to work harder and spend more money than in any of his previous re-election efforts. \Carnahan has strong ties, a reliable base\Carnahan, 52, took the long way to Capitol Hill. After growing up in a political family - his father, Mel, was governor - Carnahan first ran for Congress in 1990 in the district that included his hometown of Rolla.\Carnahan lost by a wide margin to longtime southeastern Missouri Republican Congressman Bill Emerson. \After the defeat, Carnahan moved to St. Louis and was elected to the state House, a position he held until 2004, when he won a crowded primary to replace veteran Democratic Congressman Richard Gephardt. \He hasn't had serious challenge since - until now. \After a national political publication in August identified him as an ""endangered Democrat,"" Carnahan sent out an e-mail imploring donors for help: ""While you might think that the Missouri 3rd is a safe Democratic district, it is clearly a very different climate than ever before."" \Dave Robertson, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said the 3rd District was still a Democratic seat, even this year. \""To win the 3rd, Martin will need an even stronger Republican tide than the strong tide that is helping the Republicans win more closely contested districts across the nation,"" Robertson said. ""There's always that chance, but it's a long shot today."" \Yet Carnahan is concerned enough that, in April, he paid a Washington research firm $17,000 for polling. \The political environment that manifested itself at heated town hall-style meetings across the country last year has been especially intense for Carnahan. The Democrat had a coffin paraded in front of his home in Compton Heights, had his photo burned in effigy at a Tea Party rally and has been jeered several times at public appearances. \Still, Carnahan enjoys a reliable Democratic base and has established important political inroads that could trump election-season angst. \Carnahan has appealed to veterans by pushing for inquires into failures to sterilize dental equipment at the Cochran VA medical center. He enjoys broad support among south St. Louis' Bosnian residents, in part for advocating DNA testing that allows relatives of genocide victims to identify their kin. \At a recent lunch at a Bosnian restaurant in Dutchtown, owner Suljo Grbic showed his gratitude with plates of pastries and desserts, which Carnahan's staff insisted on paying for. But even Grbic had the economy on his mind. \""Bring the more jobs, OK?"" Grbic said to Carnahan. \In a year in which voters across the U.S. are directing their ire at the party in charge in Washington, it's not hard to see why Carnahan has emerged at the center of the storm locally. He votes with his party more than 90 percent of the time. He supported the stimulus plan and voted with the president on health care.\Yet in a campaign commercial, Carnahan chose to highlight his position on another measure, the ""pay as you go law,"" designed to temper congressional spending.\Carnahan says in the ad that he sponsored the bill. Actually, he was one of 169 co-sponsors. Measures that he has been the lead sponsor on, such as one aimed at preserving rainforests and other global ecosystems, are not the type that necessarily resonate with a job-hungry public. \In a debate last month, his Republican opponent, Ed Martin, took a swipe at Carnahan for wanting to establish a conservation ""czar"" in the White House. (It's actually listed as the ""coordinator for global conservation"" in the legislation, which has not been approved.)\Martin also has criticized Carnahan for his travel - especially a visit to Antarctica, with stops in Hawaii and Australia, over New Year's 2008. The trip, with Carnahan and nine other members of the House's Science committee, cost taxpayers more than $100,000. \Carnahan says the trip was necessary to inspect American research facilities at the South Pole. \""It's easily distorted,"" Carnahan said of the expedition. ""It would be irresponsible for us to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars"" without visiting personally. \Carnahan is not the only member of his family on the ballot: His younger sister, Robin, is the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate. Her candidacy has, at times, proved awkward for Russ. \She has railed against the $700 billion bank bailout approved by Congress last year - a package Carnahan supported. Robin Carnahan has also called for an end to secretive ""earmark"" funding requests; Russ Carnahan made nearly $9 million worth of them in fiscal year 2010. \""She can speak for herself,"" Russ said about his sister, whom he has not campaigned with. ""She's very capable of doing that.""\Some allies say Carnahan is not assertive enough in trumpeting his own success. For instance, an aide says, Carnahan once staked out a key House committee chairman - holding vigil in his office lobby - to get federal approval for an access road for the River City Casino in Lemay. \One Carnahan supporter, Rock Hill bookstore owner Michelle Barron, says it's frustrating watching Carnahan taking a pensive approach at a time when voters are looking for an emotional response. \""Ed is very likable and hits people's emotions at a real core. And Russ is just sitting there stating facts,"" Barron said. ""People need to hear, 'I'm angry and I'm doing everything I can for you.' Not, 'This is what I've done so far, and it's getting better.'""\Carnahan may be getting the message. \At their debate, Carnahan slammed Martin on a public records controversy that led to his departure from the governor's office.\""He wants to do for Washington what he did for Jefferson City,"" Carnahan says. \The campaign has created an online video game, ""HackMan,"" to illustrate Martin's legal woes: A Martin icon gobbles up ""e-mails."" \In an interview, Carnahan called Martin a ""toxic"" opponent with a record of divisiveness - a style that he believes presents a clear contrast to voters. \""That's the way he operates,"" Carnahan said. ""I operate very differently.""\Martin is hard-driving with wide background\Running for Congress was an obvious move for Ed Martin - he's tried, it seems, everything else.\Martin, 40, was raised in New Jersey and moved here for law school at St. Louis University, where he met his wife, Carol, a physician. \A devout Catholic, Martin worked for the Vatican in Rome and was an aide to the St. Louis archbishop. He's been a federal court clerk, researched water quality in Indonesia and hosted a talk radio show. He also sits on the State Park Advisory Board and is past president of Missouri Roundtable for Life, an anti-abortion organization. \""I'm good at a lot of different things,"" Martin said. \Politically, Martin, who lives in St. Louis Hills, is best known for his short but rocky tenure as chief of staff to then-Gov. Matt Blunt, a Republican. \Martin, dubbed by one analyst at the time as ""a lightning rod for partisanship,"" stepped down in 2007 after 15 months. \Martin's ability to focus on many different things at once was an asset in a job in which each day brings a new crisis. But his swagger - which came off as abrupt and sometimes profane - was not always well-received. \Martin resigned amid a bruising battle with Blunt's former deputy counsel, Scott Eckersley, who contends that the office was breaking the Sunshine Law by not retaining e-mail records. After Martin fired him, Eckersley sued for wrongful termination and defamation, a suit that cost taxpayers $500,000 in a settlement to Eckersley and at least $1.3 million in attorney fees.\Eckersley claims he was fired by Martin for attempting to alert the governor's office that it was violating the Sunshine Law by not retaining office e-mails. \Martin called the suit a ""political stunt"" - the decision to settle the suit, he says, came from the Democratic state attorney general.\""We maintained from the beginning that we did nothing wrong,"" Martin said. \Either way, the flare-up laid bare Martin's full-contact political style. After Eckersley's allegations became public, the Blunt administration sent media outlets an unsolicited packet of e-mails from Eckersley's account purporting to show that he was helping his father's business on state time and had received e-mails from an adult website. \Eckersley has said that the e-mails from the site were spam, and that he was given permission by the governor's staff to assist his family's company. \In a recent interview, Eckersley - who is using some of his settlement money to run for Congress himself in southwestern Missouri - recalled Martin's temper. \""I haven't heard the type of language Ed Martin uses, even on a football field,"" Eckersley said. \The public records flap was not the only controversy Martin encountered during his time in Jefferson City. At a state housing panel meeting, Martin told a development lawyer that if ""there's a bunch of Mexicans"" on a work site, some are probably illegal immigrants. A state housing official of Mexican heritage later quit, citing Martin's ""table-thumping tirade"" in a letter to Blunt. \Jorge Riopedre, one of the local Hispanic leaders who called for Martin step down, gives Martin credit for later apologizing in a face-to-face meeting. Riopedre said he wasn't necessarily concerned with Martin's hard-charging style, as long as there was a positive goal. \""Ruffling feathers? No problem,"" Riopedre said. ""But it has to be done for a purpose.""\Prior to running Blunt's office, Martin was chairman of the St. Louis Elections Board. The board had been a national embarrassment after the 2000 presidential election, in which long lines led to a court fight to keep the polls open. \Martin, appointed chairman of the Elections Board by Blunt in 2005, oversaw improvements such as purchasing new voting machines and cracking down on voter fraud. \Clarence Dula, an Elections Board member who served with Martin, said Martin used humor to defuse tense situations.\""It became a joke, as opposed to an unpleasant berating,"" Dula, a Democrat, said. \Martin has brought some of that jocularity to the campaign trail. He calls his campaign headquarters, a converted house on Hampton Avenue, the ""Freedom Bunker."" The phone bank operation next door? The ""Freedom Annex."" \""It's a hard district,"" Martin says. ""Challenger campaigns in general don't win unless they are creative and risk-taking.""\Martin has kept pace with incumbent Russ Carnahan in the fundraising race while producing a daily stream of news releases attacking Carnahan on everything from the congressman's boat - a 42-foot river cruiser he later sold - to a stimulus check received by his brother's wind energy company. \""Nobody runs as hard as Ed does,"" said his campaign manager, Anthony Martin (no relation). ""I finally had to turn my BlackBerry e-mail ringer off. I got them at 3 a.m., I got them at 5 a.m.""\If elected, Martin says, he would work to repeal the president's health care plan, oppose ""cap and trade"" environmental legislation and advocate a ""high fence, wide gate"" border policy. \His positions have earned him the endorsement of the St. Louis Tea Party, which so far hasn't endorsed anyone else on the November ballot.\To win, Martin will have to expand his appeal beyond the Tea Party to groups such as pro-life Catholics, south St. Louis moderates and Republicans in Jefferson County. \He's campaigned in places such as Marty's Bistro in High Ridge, where he recently worked the tables during one of the restaurant's well-attended fried chicken nights. ""My name's not Carnahan, so we've had to do a lot of talking to people,"" Martin says. \Martin's best asset may be that he's not the incumbent.

We need a green stimulus package. The federal government has placed at least $700 billion on the table to bail out the reckless finance industry. However, it has done little to subsidize the alternative fuel industry, which had nothing to do with the current economic crisis but holds the key to the economy's - and the environment's - recovery.
\
The Democrats, with the blessing of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke, are suggesting a stimulus package of about $200 billion. We should use at least half of that to move America away from our dependence on petroleum and reduce our carbon footprint on the planet.
\
Green Jobs for America Campaign, a coalition of environmental and labor groups, is calling for a $100 billion green stimulus program that would include a combination of tax credits, loan guarantees and public investment in environmental technology that it says will create roughly 2 million jobs over two years.
\
The program, outlined in a report written by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and the Center for American Progress, calls for investing in new power sources, including wind, solar power and ""next-generation biofuels."" It also recommends ""expanding mass transit and freight rail,"" ""retrofitting buildings to improve energy efficiency"" and ""constructing `smart' electrical grid transmission systems.""
\
The $100 billion program, the report says, ""could be paid for with proceeds from auctions of carbon permits under a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program.""
\
The environmental benefits of such a program seem obvious. We would burn less fuel, spewing less carbon into this atmosphere. And we could spare our coastlines and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from the ravages of oil drilling.
\
But the benefits would go well beyond the positive impact on the environment. According to the report, investing in green technologies would create a broad range of employment opportunities, especially in construction and manufacturing work.
\
It also would lower energy costs for public and private buildings, making more money available for more productive endeavors.
\
The public infrastructure portion of the program - upgrades to public buildings, public transportation and the electrical grid - could be enacted quickly, according to the report. But to do so would take a commitment to public works spending that the Congress and the executive branch have not demonstrated in more than a generation.
\
Now is a crucial moment to demonstrate that commitment again, but this time with a green focus.

67,"SAN FRANCISCO\Court blocks rule on logging, burning\A federal appeals court on Wednesday blocked a Bush administration rule that allowed logging and burning projects in national forests without first analyzing their effects on the environment. \The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the U.S. Forest Service violated the National Environmental Policy Act when it issued the 2003 rule, which was billed as a way to reduce wildfires. \As part of the ""Healthy Forests Initiative,"" the ""hazardous fuels reduction"" rule exempted logging projects up to 1,000 acres and prescribed forest burns up to 4,500 acres from environmental review. \The court said the agency's failure to properly analyze the rule caused ""irreparable injury"" by allowing more than 1.2 million acres of national forest land to be logged and burned each year without studying the ecological impacts. \WASHINGTON\Senate panel OKs bill to cut greenhouse gases\A bill that would reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions dramatically cleared the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Wednesday and is headed for a vote early next year in the full Senate. \The Climate Security Act, sponsored by Sens. Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn., and John Warner, R-Va., would impose a mandatory cap-and-trade program covering coal-burning plants and other facilities that account for 80 percent of U.S. greenhouse gases. It would reduce the emissions to 70 percent of 2005 levels by 2050. That's still short of the 80 percent reduction that world scientists say is needed. \The committee voted 11-8 in favor of the bill.\President George W. Bush opposes mandatory emissions cuts. \Supporters, however, are moving ahead in the hope that whoever is elected president in 2008 will support the plan and move quickly to put it into effect.\EVERETT, MASS.\Truck crash sends fire through neighborhood\A tanker truck overturned Wednesday night, spilling 9,400 gallons of burning fuel onto a sleeping Boston suburb but injuring no one, authorities said.\Witnesses said a 10-foot wall of flame flowed through the neighborhood below a rotary where the tanker flipped, blowing up cars. \Nearby residents were hastily evacuated, including about 84 residents of a complex for older people and 10 to 12 families who lost their homes in the fire.\Credit: FROM NEWS SERVICES"
68,"What legislation being considered by Congress will permanently change American culture and the way you live? Will affect your wallet, your car, your house, your job and your dreams for a better, more secure life for your children and grandchildren? The 800-pound gorilla of tax-increasing, job-killing and free-market-manipulating legislation is HR 2454, the Waxman-Markey climate change bill. You probably haven't heard so much about Waxman-Markey. However, it's alive in Congress and, if the present version becomes law, it will have a huge impact on Illinois consumers.\Unfortunately, what began as legislation to improve our environment has morphed into a government-mandated boondoggle that provides little environmental gain while inflicting massive permanent economic pain. Ground zero for the maximum pain is Illinois and the industrial and agricultural Midwest. The legislation takes our once-enviable status as a labor-intensive manufacturing, energy-producing and crop-growing leader and leaves us with a tax-spewing albatross. The legislation is less damaging to the West Coast and Northeast states, where Congressmen Waxman (California) and Markey (Massachusetts) reside. Moreover, China, India and most other international economic competitors would not have to play by the same rules. It's difficult to imagine a more direct threat to Illinois' future economic viability.\The Illinois Energy Citizens for Jobs and Affordable Energy is an alliance of more than 25 trade associations, business and consumer organizations that have united to advocate to Illinois taxpayers and politicians on our common concerns about the deeply flawed House climate legislation. It's a diverse group that reflects Illinois' economy. Its leaders include the Illinois Farm Bureau, Mid-West Truckers Association, Home Builders Association of Illinois, energy producers, retailers, manufacturers, the Illinois affiliate of the National Federation of Independent Business and many more. We believe our two common concerns are shared by most Illinois consumers. They are:\1. The proposed legislation will enact massive energy taxes on Illinois consumers. How massive? The Heritage Foundation estimates nearly $1.40 a gallon for gasoline. In other words, at today's prices that means $4 per gallon for gasoline and diesel. Nearly everything Illinois consumers purchase is transported in a truck -- and trucking expenses will explode. In the end, their tax increase will be reflected in your shopping cart. Farmers will pay more for diesel and fertilizer. Regarding electricity, local energy cooperatives estimate a 50 percent rate increase of 5 cents per kilowatt hour. The legislation would also make Illinois more dependent on less-secure imported energy and complicate agricultural expansion and stability. Frankly, our government seemed overwhelmed implementing an effective, three-week Cash for Clunkers rebate program. Is it a good idea to hand them the car keys for our energy future?\2. The proposed legislation is an absolute job killer. CRA International and the National Black Chamber of Commerce estimate that more than 2 million jobs will disappear -- many going overseas. Illinois would lose 63,700 jobs by 2015. By 2030, more than 98,000 would be gone, according to a new CRA study. While some green jobs may emerge through government subsidies, why not keep our existing jobs and grow green jobs at the same time?\EnSys Energy estimates the legislation will reduce production at home of gasoline and other fuels and nearly double imports of these fuels. Only last year, our congressmen and senators were demanding more U.S. oil refineries -- right now! And we're expanding Illinois refineries and adding jobs at this moment. In fact, Illinois' oil industry employs more than 45,000 people and many of these jobs are well-paid technical and skilled trade positions. Now, some of the same congressmen support Waxman-Markey, which could ship these jobs overseas. What are they thinking?\Every member of the Illinois Energy Citizens for Affordable Energy and Jobs can relate similar concerns. Better yet, please attend our Springfield rally from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday at the Crowne Plaza Hotel on South Dirksen Parkway. Listen to our speakers, enjoy a light complimentary lunch and decide for yourself if the Waxman-Markey climate legislation is the way to go. We think, upon reflection, you'll agree with us that the Senate needs to slow down, think it over and get it right. See you there.\- David Sykuta is executive director of the Illinois Petroleum Council.\The Boiler Room: http://blogs.sj-r.com/boilerroom / Question of the day: Do you think the cap-and-trade bill is a major step forward for the environment, as its proponents believe, or a potential disaster for the economy?"

The ratings agency announced in September that it had revised its process to make ratings more forward-looking.\The ratings change also affects some special obligation bonds issued by St. Louis County. They were lowered to AA from AA-plus.\Thursday's news release contains several positive comments about the county, mentioning its ""strong economy,"" ""strong budgetary performance"" and ""very strong liquidity."" S&P credit analyst John Kenward is quoted as saying, ""The stable outlook reflects St. Louis County's very strong management and our expectation that the rating will not change in the next two years because we believe the county will take the steps necessary to maintain its very strong budgetary flexibility and liquidity.""\AAA is the highest rating given by Standard & Poor's. According to the firm's ratings guide, it means the issuer has ""extremely strong capacity to meet its financial commitments."" Ratings in the AA range reflect ""a very strong capacity"" to meet financial commitments. The ratings guide adds that AA entities ""differ from the highest-rated obligors only to a very small degree."" (11.08)\In the middle * Pension costs are a big reason why Detroit is in bankruptcy, and they're a topic of debate in cities from Jacksonville to Tulsa to Chicago. In St. Louis, Mayor Francis Slay pushed for, and seems to have won, a reduction in firefighter benefits.\Which cities truly face a pension crisis? The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College has crunched the numbers to make a comparison, albeit an imperfect one. It finds that Little Rock, Ark., has the highest pension burden, spending 17.6 percent of its tax revenue on retiree benefits. Chicago is close behind at 17.0 percent.\St. Louis, at 6.3 percent of tax revenue, has the 80th-highest burden and is well below the 173-city average of 7.9 percent.\The center's numbers include city pension funds, school district funds and local contributions to state-run funds. They're really more indicative of the burden on taxpayers than on a specific city or other government entity.\They also don't include pension bond payments, which is why Detroit ranks well down the list at No. 61. Detroit issued pension bonds in 2005 and 2006, reducing its pension costs but increasing interest payments. St. Louis did the same thing in 2007, issuing $143 million in bonds to help cover a pension shortfall.

MKTG, whose shares are traded on the over-the-counter market, does event marketing, interactive marketing and trade promotion.\Bonfyre says it is generating revenue from more than 50 event partners, including Express Scripts, Amazon and Budweiser. (11.06)\A big lemon * Of all the creative policies that were tried in the aftermath of the Great Recession, Cash for Clunkers was the looniest. It was billed as good for the environment, but it scrapped thousands of usable cars, requiring a lot of metal, plastic and energy to replace them. Its main economic effects were to get people to buy cars a few months earlier than they would have done otherwise, and to drive up the price of used cars.\Two Brookings Institution scholars, Ted Gayer and Emily Parker, recently reviewed the results of Cash for Clunkers, and they conclude that the program was a lemon. Its effect on gross domestic product was negligible, they say mainly it shifted about $2 billion worth of production into the third quarter of 2009 at the expense of the next two quarters.\The program also aided taxpayers who were relatively well off the median income of rebate recipients was about $69,000.\The clunkers program was billed as being about both helping the environment and creating jobs, but Gayer and Parker say it was an expensive way of pursuing either goal. Taxpayers spent $1.4 million for each job created, far more than the cost of other stimulus programs.\By putting more fuel-efficient cars on the road, the program did cut carbon dioxide emissions (if you don't count the emissions produced in replacing all the prematurely scrapped vehicles). Gayer and Parker say a cap-and-trade program or a carbon tax could have achieved the same reduction far more cheaply, making clunker rebates ""an inefficient approach to reducing emissions.""

Unfortunately, the picture in our region is even worse.\Regardless of where the United States or St. Louis ranks, one fact is clear: Too many babies are dying needlessly. We should not get so caught up in statistics that we lose sight of the human loss behind the numbers. In St. Louis and St. Louis County, more than 300 babies die every year before their first birthday. Of what potential have we deprived our community when enough children to fill an elementary school are lost every year?\It is said that ""children are our future."" But throughout the history of the Maternal, Child and Family Health Coalition, we have seen that children are our present. As goes the health of our children, especially our most vulnerable babies, so goes the health of our community. Babies dying needlessly are not in the future. They are a present reality in St. Louis. The work that lies before us all is to bring into the present the future vision of women entering pregnancy healthy, moms getting adequate prenatal care, children getting protection from preventable diseases, families accessing health care services and families living in healthy housing.

Unemployed people could be shoring up our roads, our state parks, our deteriorated neighborhoods and our government buildings, to name only a few possibilities. People who are not physically able to do heavy work could do administrative work.\Another good suggestion in the article was that people who have jobs could agree to take fewer hours so that others would have a chance to work.\In times like these, we need to help each other and share with those who don't have enough.\Joan G. Botwinick - St. Louis County\Nothing but greed\I was angry and disappointed by Emerson CEO David Farr's recent comments (""Emerson CEO blasts government, says firm will expand overseas,"" Nov. 12). Mr. Farr attacked the U.S. government for using its power to destroy U.S. manufacturing. He complained about cap and trade, medical reform and labor rules. He said, ""I'm not going to hire anybody in the United States. I'm moving.""\I don't believe it. Mr. Farr will stay in his nice home in a nice neighborhood with nice streets. He probably likes his police and fire protection. Mr. Farr probably wants his kids to go to a nice school and breathe clean air. He probably wants the protection of the Constitution and Bill of Rights - for which people fought and died.\Perhaps Americans want to preserve the environment, and perhaps they believe that labor is made up of people who need health care and reasonable wages. Perhaps the American government is doing what the American people want it to do. Eventually, employees everywhere want to be paid for their labor. Eventually, they want health care and a safe environment, too.

Many areas in Missouri have so little vaccine right now that it's carefully apportioned to physicians and clinics.\You better believe I'm outraged by this incompetence (""Roy Blunt, populist,"" Nov.10). Try government-run health care, see what happens. The federal government can't handle flu shots.\Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius didn't have on hand the Post-Dispatch's alibi for the administration - the vaccine culture doesn't grow as fast as expected - when she testified before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21. I take it this tale was developed only after events have exposed the nation's woeful lack of preparedness.\But this begs the question: When did the Obama administration know the government was going to fail to have the shots ready, and why didn't it level with the public? When did the slowness of vaccine culture come to knowledge? The federal government, after all, has been preparing for a pandemic flu season for years and has known about this threat for six months.\This is a failure of the most basic role of government.

71,"Response to threat of global warming\ When it comes to global warming, President George W. Bush's administration puts its faith in volunteerism and new energy technologies to scale back America's Everest of heat-trapping gases. But government studies say the results are at best uncertain.\ One thing is not: Each year, the mountain of ""greenhouse"" gases emitted by the United States grows bigger. While the rest of the developed world requires -- but isn't always achieving -- mandatory cuts in carbon dioxide and other emissions, the nation adding the most gases to the atmosphere is deadlocked in a debate over how to deal with it. Individual states, meanwhile, are taking the lead.\ Voluntary programs emphasized by Bush since 2002 are claimed to be sparing the atmosphere 300 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, or 4 percent of U.S. emissions.\ But the government doesn't know, and often can't verify, whether the reductions reported by 230 U.S. companies are real.\ Unverified results\ ""It's difficult to prove,"" said Paul McArdle, who manages the Energy Department's voluntary reporting system. ""It's my sense that some of these are real reductions.""\ What's more, McArdle acknowledged, companies can increase their emissions overall but still claim cuts -- by counting as reductions such steps as replacing old lighting, using more efficient vehicles or planting trees.\ In a review last April, Congress's Government Accountability Office questioned Washington's ability to monitor these voluntary efforts. ""Determining the reductions attributable to each program will be challenging,"" it said.\ In one program with measurable results, it estimated companies have reduced emissions by no more than one-half of 1 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution. Total U.S. emissions, now more than 7 billion metric tons a year, still are projected to rise 14 percent from 2002 to 2012.\ Carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels is the biggest of the greenhouse gases, so called because they produce a heat-trapping blanket when released into the atmosphere. Others are methane, nitrous oxide and synthetic gases. The atmosphere holds more carbon dioxide now than it has for hundreds of thousands of years, and the Earth's surface warmed an average of 1 degree in the past century.\ White House plan\ As a first step, the White House talks of reducing the ""intensity"" of U.S. carbon pollution -- not shrinking emissions overall, but reducing the carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic growth.\ ""Our objective is to significantly slow the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and, as the science justifies, stop it and then reverse it,"" said James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. ""We're making good progress. It's reasonably ambitious, but it still provides for reasonable human welfare.""\ Shortly after taking office, Bush rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which requires 36 industrial nations, by 2012, to cut global-warming gases by an average 5 percent below 1990 levels.\ He argued that cutting the U.S. share to less than 6 billion tons a year, as the treaty would have required, would have cost 5 million U.S. jobs. He objected, too, that such high-polluting developing nations as China and India are not required to reduce emissions.\ Calls for more action\ Some members of Congress agree with the gradualist Bush approach, whereas others do not, Republicans among them.\ ""Everybody's talking about it. What the American people want is for somebody to start doing something about it,"" complained Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., House Science Committee chairman.\ ""If we can't make a relatively simple change in (automobile) mileage regulations -- a change to an existing regulation that doesn't even require new technology and that would have numerous benefits aside from the climate implications -- then what does that say about our ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?"" Boehlert said. ""It certainly doesn't say anything good.""\ The United States is spending $3 billion each year researching technologies to cut global warming and $2 billion on climate research. In a program called the Asia-Pacific Partnership, Bush also is working with Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea - - producers of half the world's greenhouse gases -- to attract private money for cleaner energy technologies.\ Connaughton calls that joint effort a major breakthrough. Sen. Jim Jeffords calls it an ""excuse for further delay."" Jeffords, an independent from Vermont, is a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\ Bush envisions using more hydrogen-powered vehicles, electricity from renewable energy sources and clean coal technology.\ Government projects\ The Energy Department's technology program has helped build 34,000 new energy-efficient homes, and it plans to establish ""bioenergy"" research centers and to advance research into hydrogen fuel and fusion energy. Its director, Stephen Eule, promises breakthroughs in the coming decades.\ Scientists say climate disruptions might occur before that, however; and critics in Congress and elsewhere say the government effort is too slow and needs refocusing.\ The plan ""appears stalled near the starting line,"" said Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Ill., who heads a House subcommittee overseeing the program. A review in May by the Energy Department's research lab in Oak Ridge, Tenn., said the program focused too much on work that could lead to ""only incremental improvements."" It called for more emphasis on ""exploratory, out-of-the-box concepts.""\ ""There is a need for more high-risk but high-payoff research,"" the review concluded.\ A new government economic analysis sees markets in combination with research as the way to go. The Congressional Budget Office report last month said that any cost-effective U.S. policy on global warming must put a price on carbon -- via an emissions tax or a ""cap and trade"" system of buying and selling emissions allowances among companies, as in Europe.\ ""Setting a current price for carbon emissions and announcing planned future carbon prices not only would induce firms and households to change their behavior but also would increase their demand for technologies that would reduce emissions,"" congressional budget researchers said.\ Emissions caps\ Some businesses want national caps now on carbon emissions, believing them inevitable.\ ""It is very difficult to have a product that is regulated significantly differently from state to state,"" said Bill Gerwing, environmental policy director for the oil company BP America.\ Contributing to Washington's impasse is skepticism in some quarters about whether global warming is even a problem.\ The Senate Environment chairman, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., likens concerns about the Earth warming to Chicken Little saying the sky is falling.\ ""Global warming is an alarmism. It's a type of a hoax,"" said Inhofe. ""The reality is that a cap on carbon is a cap on the economy, through the rationing of energy.""\ Similar thinking pervades the House, Boehlert said. ""The scientific consensus has simply not pierced through the ideological barriers,"" he said.\ Former Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., who in 1988 led the first major legislative attempt to curb greenhouse gases, said next month's congressional elections could provide the ""most important push"" in the debate.\ In her current job of helping the Environmental Protection Agency recruit companies to cut carbon, she finds more shareholders viewing climate change as a top concern, she said.\ ""You've got the push of shareholders and eventually the pull of Congress moving America,"" Schneider said. ""We just need a new Congress.""\ Elements of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming\ GASES: Seeks to control emissions of six heat-trapping gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride. TARGETS: Assigns numerical targets for reducing or limiting emissions, compared with 1990 benchmark, for 36 industrialized countries among 140 nations that ratified the pact. The U.S. hasn't ratified it.\ TRADING: Allows emissions trading among the 36 countries. Industrial plants that emit less than allotted can sell resulting ""credits"" to those that exceed their allowances.\ JOINT IMPLEMENTATION: Allows nation to earn credits for financing emissions-reduction projects in another country subject to Kyoto controls.\ CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM: Allows country to earn credits via emission-reduction projects in developing nations, which are not obliged to cut emissions.\ THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"
72,"WASHINGTON - Barely noted among the changes pushed by Barack Obama's new administration was a decision this week that will be felt from the scarred mountains of Appalachia to the corporate headquarters of St. Louis-based coal giants.\The Interior Department declared plans to depart from years of precedent by protecting fragile streams when coal operators blast the tops off of mountains and dump millions of tons of rock and debris into the valleys beneath.\It is one of many incremental changes in Obama's first 100 days in office, which he will mark at a town hall meeting in Arnold today, that add up to a profound shift in governing.\Experts and politicians agree that the new president is moving swiftly in areas that go beyond his much-publicized efforts to fix the economy, revamp the health care system and meet the threat of climate change. U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt, a Republican from Springfield who is a candidate for Senate, said he is surprised at how swiftly this administration has moved. ""Not only the tilt of the agenda to the left but also the aggressiveness of the agenda on so many different fronts,"" he asserted. Susan MacManus, an expert on the presidency from the University of South Florida, agreed.\""It's not just the speed but the 180-degree shifts we're seeing. You can usually have one or the other, but rarely do you have both to the degree that we are seeing with Obama.""\100-DAY CLUES\Sizing up a president after 100 days of a 1,460-day term is akin to predicting the outcome of a baseball game in the first inning. Yet examining a president's first few months has become an enduring custom since Franklin Roosevelt pushed the Democratic-run Congress to give him what he needed in 100 days back in 1933 for relief from the Great Depression. (It did.)\While it may be risky to pass judgment with so much business unfinished, the 100-day critique offers clues to what lies ahead, said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank who's been around Washington long enough to have been a speechwriter for Dwight Eisenhower.\""It's particularly interesting when you have a president like this who has no experience,"" Hess said, ""because there's really no job or no school that prepares you for the presidency.""\Hess' initial assessment? ""I think he has proved to be something of a natural. He seems very comfortable in the job. Seems to be very good as far as the elements of picking people, delegating responsibility and keeping a lot of balls in the air without dropping very many of them,"" he said.\Steven A. Smith, director of Washington University's Weidenbaum Center and an expert on Congress, says it's all but impossible to size up this president so soon, if only because Obama himself describes his agenda in such lofty terms.\""We're talking about remaking a good deal of federal policy in almost the entire areas of environment, education and the economy, all of which are subject to big reform and none of which can be expected to be done inside of 100 days,"" he said.\Nonetheless, Obama already has scored significant legislative victories with his $787 billion stimulus plan pumping money into the ailing economy and a broad expansion of the federal program providing health care to children.\Obama has risks ahead, among them managing a war in Afghanistan that now bears his imprint and spending political capital for the costly cap-and-trade system he wants to reduce greenhouse gases. What lies ahead for Obama, says Smith, is a twin political challenge: keeping House liberals ""on the short leash"" while appealing to Senate Republicans he could well need for his far-reaching reforms.\On health care, Obama and the Democrats face key tests in the next 100 days, analysts said. First, they must design the ""public option"" Obama prefers that would put government in the health care business. Second, they must decide whether to pursue the politically sensitive strategy of using a budget process known as reconciliation to advance reforms. Such legislation can't be filibustered but would amount to Democrats going it alone with little or no GOP support.\""The real trick for the administration is to continue to appear to be meeting public demand in a responsible, moderate way,"" said Smith.\'STEADY STYLE'\Judging by polls, what Obama has supplied thus far is in line with public desires. A series of polls in recent days gave him an average approval rating of just under 63 percent, slightly higher than George W. Bush eight years ago and better than Ronald Reagan in 1981.\The University of Missouri's Mitchell McKinney, an expert in political communications, says that Obama's steady, contemplative style is working.\""He very much takes the professorial mode, explaining the process of decision-making and inviting others to come to conclusions he has come to,"" he said. ""The public has become comfortable with this style in these unsteady times.""\Obama's opposition may be a minority in Congress and across the country. But the recent ""tea party"" protests reflect a hardening of attitudes toward Obama's debt-creating programs and the corporate bailouts that he has continued.\And even polls showing lofty favorability ratings contain warning signs. In a Pew Research Center poll last week, 20 percent responded by saying ""socialist"" when asked for a one word impression of the new president, surpassed only by ""intelligent"" (30 percent) and ""good"" (29 percent).\Tom De Luca is a political science professor at Fordham University and co-author of ""Liars! Cheaters! Evildoers! Demonization and the End of Civil Debate in American Politics."" De Luca said it is normal for members of the party not in power to loathe political leaders, but that Obama and his policies have inspired some ""vitriolic"" opposition. ""In Obama's case, I think it is heightened by a feeling of people losing their bearings and seeing their sense of identity threatened,"" De Luca said. Obama may or may not know about the latest local tea party protest scheduled when he arrives in Jefferson County today for his town hall meeting. The president's decision to visit Missouri - which he lost in the nation's closest political contest last year - surely is a political calculation looking ahead to a re-election campaign.\Blunt is among Republicans who believe that the Obama's polling numbers will fall back to earth. ""It's clearly a studied strategy to have so many targets out there that the American people can't get focused on all of them,"" Blunt said.\For Blunt's Republicans, Obama's first 100 days have generated a new cohesion in Washington in a party that has renewed its focuses on taxes and spending while searching for other appealing ideas.\---\ECONOMY\Obama was thrust into crisis mode at the outset dealing with an economy in free fall.

73,"All service members are heroes - just for signing up\I disagree with Bill McClellan's column ""'Hero' and 'veteran' are not synonyms"" (Jan. 27). I consider all those who have served since the draft ended to be heroes because they joined voluntarily and accepted the risks and sacrifices that are inherent with military service. That is even truer since 2001, after which the risks were more apparent. Sure, they may have joined because they needed college money, a paying job or direction in life. But, because of their character, they also signed up for love of country and an obedience to duty. It's safe to say that our way of life and our freedoms are at risk. Isn't that worth defending? Is everyone else like the mother in Ohio who, when asked if her son would join the military, said, ""We aren't that kind of people."" How proud she must be. Is that how we view citizenship?\Traditionally, soldiers were heroes if they received medals for valor. But what about soldiers today who die or are maimed by bombs, enemy fire, friendly fire or vehicle accidents? Are they so insignificant that they don't merit being called heroes? And what of the soldiers who return home in one piece? With two asymmetrical wars where there are no front lines, every soldier is involved and at risk. Every one is a hero, whether he is waiting to go or already is in theater. If we can't appreciate that, then we're no better than the mother in Ohio.\Bill Miskall - Dittmer, Mo.\Celebrate valor\Regarding ""'Hero' and 'veteran' are not synonyms"" (Jan. 27): To borrow a phrase, for the first time in my adult life, I'm proud of Bill McClellan. He's exactly right about the dilution of the meaning of the word ""hero."" Like him, I did my service, but I'm no hero. (One quibble: do you really think one politician would accuse another of misusing words?)\Let's expand on the thought that if everyone is a hero, no one is. Why do all of our recent memorials emphasize the ""sacrifice"" and the sadness of lives lost and none celebrate the heroism and valor of the American soldier, individually and collectively?\The 9/11 Pentagon memorial is dedicated to the lives lost; how about the heroism of those who went into the burning building and pulled survivors out? Same with the Washington, D.C. memorials to the Vietnam and Korean wars: nothing but sadness and sacrifice. I'd rather see some celebration of the kind of heroism that has always made our fighting men and women the best in the world.\But maybe that would be too much of a celebration of American exceptionalism.\Tom Jeffrey - St. Louis County\One more try\Did I read correctly about the President Casino closing because it had revenue of only $22.6 million last year (""It's snake eyes for President Casino,"" Jan. 28)? How many companies in the St. Louis area would like to do that kind of business - companies that work hard manufacturing this or that and that back their products up with a guarantee?\Does this tell us something about our chances of winning while playing at these casinos?\But there is that one chance. Maybe I've been playing the wrong machine. I'd better hurry to the President for one more try.\Harvey Meyer - Green Park\A better solution than skipping meds\In the St. Louis area, unemployment increased from 7.1 percent to 9.9 percent over the past year. For many workers, receiving a pink slip also means losing health insurance coverage.\That's troubling news in a state plagued with nearly 3.3 million cases of chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer and stroke. The uninsured and those struggling financially may be tempted to skip doses of medicine. But failing to take prescribed medicine can lead to long-term health problems and the need for even more health care services.\Fortunately, help is available. Former Pittsburgh Steelers halfback Jerome ""The Bus"" Bettis, who retired in 2006 after a Super Bowl victory, said it best recently when he noted that ""a lot of times people don't need a hand out, they just need a hand up."" The Partnership for Prescription Assistance, sponsored by America's pharmaceutical research and biotechnology companies, provides that hand up.\Uninsured and financially struggling patients can turn to the PPA to identify programs that provide free or nearly free access to more than 2,500 brand-name and generic medicines. The PPA is a single point of access to 475 patient assistance programs, including nearly 200 operated by America's biopharmaceutical companies.\Since April 2005, the PPA has helped nearly 155,000 people in Missouri and more than 6 million patients nationwide find programs that offer much needed assistance.\Patients can call toll-free 1-888-477-2669 or visit www.pparx.org to find out if they qualify for help.

That is bad advice.\If you shut the car off, you will lose power steering and, even worse, the steering wheel will lock, which means you would not be able to steer to the curb. The engine should not be turned off if the driver needs to steer the vehicle.\In 1957, I had a similar problem with a Renault Dauphine. Parts had to be ordered from France, and it took six months to fix. Things never change.\John P. Goodman - Florissant\Repower America\Environment Illinois applauds President Barack Obama for making clean-energy and global warming legislation a priority in his State of the Union address. Americans already have begun to see the benefits of the unprecedented $80 billion in clean energy and green transportation in his economic recovery plan. This investment has created jobs, saved Americans money and reduced global warming-related pollution.\Yet America cannot fully transition to a clean-energy economy without making long-term investments in clean energy and finally holding polluters accountable for their emissions of global warming-causing pollutants. It is time to put American ingenuity and technological know-how to work designing 21st-century solutions to our economic, energy and pollution problems. The U.S. Senate must pass comprehensive clean-energy and global warming legislation this year to truly repower America. Alexandra Silva - Forest Park, Ill.\Field Associate, Environment Illinois\Who knows best?\So, President Barack Obama thinks he didn't explain things well enough. That is not the problem.\Having worked for more than 30 years for a defense contractor, I have been on many proposal teams with some very sharp people. Usually, the customer (some branch of the Department of Defense) would tell us what he wanted (via a specification document), and we would design a concept to do just that. Sometimes, believing we knew better than the customer, we would proceed to tell the customer what he really needed. But it wasn't what he asked for and it usually cost more because it had some really good bells and whistles. Almost always we were told to go home, and our competitor got the job.\So now, Mr. Obama, Hosue Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., want to do the same thing to the American public with health care reform, cap and trade, stimulus bills, etc. They think they know better than we do what we need. They are wrong. Emil Stevens - Chesterfield"
74,"Media is distorting Israel's past\George Santayana's famous phrase ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it"" needs at least one corollary: Those who distort the past condemn the innocent. The story ""Israel at 60: A nation still in search of itself"" (April 20) contains more than one revisionist distortion, but the most egregious is that Israel ""has occupied another nation for 41 years.""\There never has been an Arab nation on the land that now is Israel. \Once a part of the Ottoman Empire, British Mandatory Palestine was divided into Arab and Jewish areas by the United Nations in 1947. Decimated by the Holocaust, the Jewish people accepted the meager portion offered them. In return, five Arab nations launched a war to destroy the nascent Jewish state: ""This will be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades,"" Azzam Pasha, Secretary General of the Arab League, said on May 15, 1948.\During the last 60 years, wars have drawn and redrawn the map of Israel, as the Israeli people repulsed Arab armies in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973 and defended themselves from cross-border infiltrations and terrorist attacks that continue to this day.\Palestinain Liberation Organization leader Yassar Arafat rejected opportunities for autonomy, legitimacy and statehood several times, notably the 1993 Oslo Accords, and a generous last-ditch offer from Ehud Barak and then-President Bill Clinton in 2000. Mr. Arafat responded by launching the latest round of terror war.\In 2000, the Arab population in the West Bank was 95 percent under the control of the Palestinian Authority, practically a state. In 2005, Ariel Sharon forcibly removed every Jewish person from the Gaza Strip; a de-facto state now exists. The terrorist group Hamas fires rockets daily to terrorize the Israeli towns of Sderot and Ashkelon. Israeli prime ministers repeatedly demonstrate they have no desire to govern the Arab population of Gaza and the West Bank, and 1 million Israeli Arabs live and work peacefully within the Jewish democratic state. I hope the definition of ""state"" is clearer now.\Donald Meissner | St. Louis County\Chair, Anti-Defamation League Israel Task Force\As American as apple pie\The cartoon portraying corn-based ethanol as the cause for starving children on April 16 was inaccurate, alarmist and misleading. I was appalled to see such a blatant misrepresentation.\Let's draw a different picture. Only about 10 percent of the corn grown in the United States is the edible corn you see in the grocery store. The corn used for ethanol is not food-grade and does not go directly into the human food supply. The No. 2 yellow corn that most farmers grow is used in livestock feed. \Increases in food costs are tied to the high price of oil. Only about 20 cents of every dollar spent on food is related to the raw farm product. The other 80 percent is related to transportation, labor, processing and marketing.\Despite the emotional hype, there is no shortage of corn. Last year, Missouri farmers produced the second-largest crop in the state's history. Nationwide, it was the largest crop since World War II.\Ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions, creates jobs and keeps consumers' dollars in America. And, according to Merrell Lynch, the added supply of biofuels is reducing gasoline costs by 15 percent. While it is not the solution, ethanol is a piece of the puzzle needed to solve our addiction on foreign oil. To print a cartoon based on half-truths and misinformation is contemptuous and simply irresponsible.\Jayne Glosemeyer | Marthasville, Mo.\Wearing them out\It is time that our country put a stop to the endless campaigning that has developed this year in the presidential nomination contest. Criss-crossing the country, repeating speeches and kissing babies will not prepare any candidate for the White House.\No wonder U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., forgets and misspeaks, U.S. Sen. Barack Obama's reflections are misunderstoood and every word and body movement are picked apart. They must lose sleep at night trying to determine how to deflect the slings of the other parties and the endless digging of the press. \This is the first time we've had a woman, a black man and an older man run the same year. Let us not wear them out before their time of real use to our country. \We should make a law to limit the waste of time, energy and money and make a sensible preparation for the White House. That would be a real campaign reform law.\Katherine Hoyer | University City\God-given limitations\As we have seen with the global warming debate and soon will see in Ben Stein's movie, ""Expelled,"" dissenting opinion is not tolerated by the left in this country. Some people in the self-proclaimed open-minded crowd, who blindly bow at the altar of their prophets Al Gore and Charles Darwin, simply refuse to accept that there is considerable evidence in direct contradiction to what they trumpet as indisputable. The reason is that there is an alternative motive to their agenda.\Specifically, in regards the theory of evolution, the primary focus is not to prove that evolution in and of itself exists. Rather, the purpose is to prove that God doesn't exist. Then, any behavior, choice or belief is validated by the very absence of any God-given limitations.\Carl Schroeder | Wildwood\Cracking down instead of coming together\The ""GOP cracks down on Ron Paul activists"" (April 20), about a meeting in which Republicans were forced to support U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the presumptive Republican nominee for president, or be excluded from local conventions, illustrates that we Republicans are going to lose in November if we don't straighten up. Mr. McCain may be the presumptive nominee, but the Missouri Republican Party's actions to stifle dissent are more reminiscent of the communist China than the party of Lincoln.\Although Ron Paul supporters should honor the outcome of the primary vote, the party must recognize that Missouri Republicans are not all neoconservatives. By hushing the discussion, the party violates its belief in constitutional rights and its core principle of liberty. If we cannot debate issues internally, how can citizens expect us to deal with Democrats in Washington and Jefferson City? At least U.S. Sens.

Shouldn't he be calling them tax deferrals since the lost revenue will have to be covered by loans that will have to be repaid by taxes at a later date?\Wil Fritz | SmithtonArrogant\administration\I agree with the Post-Dispatch's assessment of Bushonomics and our energy policy (""Adopting Bushonomics,"" April 21). When the Bush/Cheney/Rice oil cabal took power in 2001, a barrel of oil was averaging $23 and gasoline was about $1.50 a gallon. Since then, oil has risen to $114 a barrel and gasoline is about $3.50 a gallon in St. Louis. The federal Department of Energy estimates it will be $4 a gallon by summer. When queried about $4 cost at a recent news conference, President George W. Bush said he hadn't heard about it. How does the president expect us to defeat Islamofacism by shopping if we can't afford the gas to drive to the mall?\In January 2001, the president issued an executive order creating the National Energy Policy Development Group, chaired by Vice President Dick Cheney. It met in secret and was comprised chiefly of energy industry CEOs and lobbyists. The minutes of these meetings have been withheld from the scrutiny of the Democratically led Congress by the administration, citing executive privilege. Looking at our current situation it would seem that the Bush/Republican energy policy was designed to gouge the average American taxpayer while enriching the administration's friends. I don't think U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., would upset the energy industry by changing the status quo should he be elected president.\It's been said that the only thing more dangerous than ignorance is arrogance, and in combination the two qualities are even more alarming. It's become apparent that the Bush administration has shown a surfeit of both in its handling of America's burgeoning energy crisis. \Edward Olsen | Affton\Measured approach\Contrary to the glib poke at President George W. Bush in ""Adopting Bushonomics"" (April 21), he is taking a very measured approach to climate change hysteria. \First, there is no clear evidence this apparent warming is anything but natural and not human-caused. Moreover, if all human activity since the Industrial Revolution could be reversed, it would amount to only about 1 degree Celsius. For that, the Chicken Little cries are meant only to paint Mr. Bush as reckless and careless with the environment, all in support of the liberal political agenda. That approach can wreak severe economic loss to our economy in the short run and do little if anything about greenhouse gas emissions. \Bush's ""voluntary reductions"" will result in a bigger U.S. contribution to any world effort than all the self-proclaimed United Nations and European Union reductions. I have no problem giving thought and research to the climate situation and eliminating unnecessary emissions of any kind. Kyoto, ""cap-and-trade"" and ""carbon credits,"" however, are nothing more than a U.N. scheme to transfer wealth from the West to a bunch of have-not Third World countries that cannot care for themselves because of inept, corrupt and failed socialist governments. \Liberals would have us mess up the greatest economy in the world based on questionable science that deserves serious research before drastic changes are made at great expense to the most productive elements in our economy. \Otherwise, by the rationale that carbon dioxide emissions contribute to climate change, we should cease cutting trees to make newsprint. Trees reduce CO2, so cutting them is unconscionable when we can go to a computer and get news pollution-free. Is Lee Enterprises willing to forgo profit to save the world from climate change? Or is it a matter of whose ox is being gored? \Ron Jones | Alton\The Denier\Just think where we might be if the Bush administration had proposed higher fuel economy standards at the beginning of his first term, rather than being ""The Denier"" in regards to the environment.\Kevin Kettler | St. Louis"

77,"WASHINGTON -- Republicans are trying to sell the false premise that protecting the environment inevitably means sacrificing jobs. President Obama should denounce this snake oil for what it is rather than appear to accept it.\The GOP presidential candidates are in remarkable agreement on two articles of faith: The human imagination, apparently, is incapable of conjuring any circumstance under which any tax may ever be raised. And the Environmental Protection Agency is a sinister laboratory where evildoers conjure regulations designed to rob Americans of their God-given jobs.\Actually, I'm being somewhat unfair to Mitt Romney, who tempers his EPA-bashing with the admission that he supports the agency ""in much of its mission."" When he was governor of Massachusetts, Romney favored initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, perhaps even a regional cap-and-trade system. He doesn't bring this up much on the campaign trail, but his opponents do.\The other contenders range from anti-EPA all the way to ... well, to Michele Bachmann's pledge to abolish the agency. Bachmann told an Iowa crowd last month that if she is elected president, ""I guarantee you the EPA will have doors locked and lights turned off, and they will only be about conservation.""\Rick Perry has an actual record as an EPA-basher, having taken the agency to court in an effort to block rules on greenhouse gas emissions. Obama's ""EPA regulations are killing jobs all across America,"" Perry said. His book ""Fed Up!"" cites an estimate by the conservative Heritage Foundation of catastrophic job losses from greenhouse gas rules.\On Friday, Obama appeared to cede the point new environmental regulations kill jobs. He blocked new EPA rules limiting ground-level ozone -- otherwise known as smog -- as part of a larger effort to reduce ""regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty"" for U.S. businesses. The move came hours after a disappointing labor report showing that the economy added no new jobs in August.\The move to block the ozone rules may make sense politically, since it defuses an issue. As a matter of public policy, however, it's wrong.\In developing the rule that Obama nixed, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson was simply fulfilling the agency's prime mission: protecting human health.\""Breathing ozone can trigger a variety of health problems including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and congestion,"" says the agency's website. ""It can worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. ""\In 2008, the Bush administration set a permissible standard for ozone that exceeded the limit recommended by EPA scientists. Jackson sought to bring the standard within a safe range.\As for the predictions of massive job losses, they sound just like the warnings we heard when environmental regulations ended acid rain or ensured that the citizens of Cleveland no longer had to worry about the Cuyahoga River catching fire.\There is plenty of evidence that the net effect of smart environmental regulation is to create jobs, not destroy them. New, more efficient plants are built; older, dirtier facilities are retrofitted. Companies innovate by developing new technology.\The ozone rule seemed well-grounded, and the objections to it were more political than rational.\We don't have to choose between jobs and health.

78,"Editor's note: Three area professors recently met with the News-Leader editorial board to stress their common view that climate change creates economic and biological dangers. We decided to pass some of their questions on to area lawmakers on the federal level for answers and they were published previously.\We conclude the series with lawmakers' answers to a follow-up question from a reader today.\Question: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to curb global warming and achieving energy independence are closely related endeavors since both require a massive lowering of our dependence on fossil fuels. To what extent do world population growth and current levels of immigration into the U.S. hinder the attainment of this requirement?\- Norman W. Youngsteadt, Springfield\U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt said: In addition to my concerns about the massive cost of the Washington Democrats' national energy tax plan and its impact on Missouri jobs, I'm very concerned that it simply shifts the production of pollutants to countries like India and China with huge populations and lower pollution standards.\We should be focused on pursuing an ""all of the above"" energy plan based on energy we produce right here in the United States. Energy we produce at home will be cleaner, more efficient, and ultimately cheaper than buying huge portions of our energy from dangerous regimes and countries with big populations and practically non-existent environmental standards.\The American Energy Act, which I have long advocated, provides for investment in renewable sources, such as wind, solar, biofuels, and nuclear, while accepting the reality that Missouri gets 80 percent of its energy from coal.\My opponent, Robin Carnahan, supports the cap and trade national energy tax which the Heritage Foundation says would destroy over 32,000 Missouri jobs in the first year alone. We need more American energy of all kinds, not a new job-killing national energy tax.\U.S. Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond said: On immigration, one of the government's highest priorities should be to secure the border and stop illegal immigration into the United States. I continue to believe we must embark on a clean energy revolution over the next generation to wean ourselves off foreign oil and to reduce our impact on the environment, but we must do so without employing costly strategies that will kill jobs or punish hardworking families. Developing and investing in these transformative solutions will help to deal with any population growth or movement over the coming decades.\U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill said: With the growing energy demands of our country, we cannot afford to continue on the path we are currently on. I believe that the United States can and must be a leader in developing alternative energy sources, and I fully support our continued efforts to explore and invest in new technologies and new solutions that can wean us off of foreign oil.\But while I think that most Americans agree we must reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources and embrace cleaner, renewable energy, we need to be careful that we don't fall behind developing countries who are continuing to rely heavily on cheaper, coal-powered energy.\That's why we need an energy bill that doesn't hurt our competitiveness at home and abroad. Unless leaders from other countries around the globe get on board, we will never be able to address this issue world-wide."
79,"I read Councilman Dan Chiles' recent fairy tales regarding mass transit, riding bikes and clean-energy innovation and was stunned by their shortsightedness. If Dan and his liberal buddies would hold hands, sing ""Kumbaya"" and tap their ruby slippers together, the Wizard might grant them foresight.\How can you write an article about clean-energy solutions and never mention the cleanest form of energy there is: nuclear power. Nuclear power emits zero greenhouse gases. The technology is here now; we don't have to invent it. Energy generated right now by solar and wind is 1/10th of 1 percent of the energy we use. Yes, nuclear power has drawbacks, as do wind and solar. It would take 20,000 acres of land filled with solar panels to match one nuclear plant. It should be easy to find 20,000 acres around Springfield.

(Ha!) They even offered tax incentives to get people to buy fuel-efficient cars like hybrids. Anyone care to guess what happened?\For starters, all those fuel efficient cars mean the state's collecting 5 million dollars per year less in gas tax revenue. That's the revenue used to build roads, bridges, and really neat stuff like that. Realizing that they'd soon not have enough money to pave a driveway, they came up with a plan only a liberal could love: Put GPS transponders in every new car sold and start taxing the miles a person drives.\Just think of the advantages of having a GPS in every car. Big Brother liberal will know where you're at 24-7. And Big Brother liberal can track exactly when the driving was done, meaning government can charge you more at certain times, like morning and evening rush hours. Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't liberals squealing like pigs when President Bush wiretapped suspected terrorists, enemies of America? Now liberals in Oregon want a GPS in every citizen's car!\All of which creates two questions I need answered. 1) Why buy a hybrid? If a hybrid is taxed at the same rate (miles driven) as a Hemi, I'll take the Hemi. 2) Mr. Chiles, have you ever served in government in Oregon?\People, the bottom line is: Big Brother liberal is coming after your freedoms. A tobacco tax because Big Brother government says you don't need to smoke. Cap and trade because Mr. Chiles says you're killing the environment. A GPS in every car, because you don't care if the government knows where you are every minute. And if the liberals have their way, you better put down that doughnut if you want your government health care. It's about control.

One of President Obama's first priorities is development of a new energy policy aimed at lessening dependence on foreign oil and saving the environment. He and his Democrat minions want to tax carbon emissions. Instead, Republicans want to develop alternative sources of energy, mainly nuclear generation.
\
The cap-and-trade scheme promoted by Democrats would impose tax penalties on generators of carbon emissions. Tax credits could be bought and sold, aimed at costing polluters and benefiting cleaner producers. This would impose a burden on the overall economy, but would it reduce emissions?
\
Republicans instead would promote nuclear power, clearly the source with most potential to generate large volumes of energy without damage to the ozone. For the production of electrical energy a combination of nuclear power and cleaner coal is the one-two punch, using plentiful resources at our disposal. Even if Democrats want to penalize coal and oil burners they should still maximize the use of nuclear power, and government should do all it can to promote cleaner coal.
\
Environmentalists can be credited for good intentions but they expect far too much benefit from wind and solar power. Ethanol is losing favor for good reason, but politicians continue to yield to the farm lobby. Despite well known disadvantages, they actually talk about mandating an even larger mixture of ethanol in all the gasoline we buy. Some form of biomass might become feasible, but corn distillation is not it.
\
If nuclear is a great alternative for generating electrical power, no such magic bullet yet exists for motor fuel. The electric car becomes more promising but remains a marginal fix. We are intrigued with the idea of burning vegetable oil with emissions that smell like French fries. But all these alternatives are up against the immutable fact that the internal combustion engine powered by fossil fuel is far the most efficient.
\
As energy policies are developed in Washington, at least they should feature at the outset changes that will really work right away. So far, the only one is more nuclear generation.

81,"As oil continues to gush from an out-of-control well on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico, the Senate is preparing for a crucial vote on America's energy future.\At issue is a resolution by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, that would prevent the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions.\Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, is expected to play a key role in today's vote.\She is a strong supporter of President Barack Obama, whose administration would be rebuked by the resolution.\However, Ms. McCaskill always has been moderate on climate change - recognizing its reality but urging an approach that doesn't unnecessarily penalize Missouri industries and workers.\Ms. McCaskill was one of four Democrats who had cosponsored a separate measure that would impose a two-year ""time out"" before the EPA could enact rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, refineries and factories.\But Ms. Murkowski's resolution goes much farther. Instead of asking for a time out, it declares EPA regulation of carbon dioxide emissions to be out of bounds.\That would hamstring the nation's ability to address climate change and lock in our preference for dirty, dangerous energy sources at a time when China and other nations are making substantial investments in clean technology. Even Abu Dhabi is building what it calls the world's largest concentrated solar power plant and the first of its kind in the Middle East.\The BP oil disaster is a timely reminder that the cost of America's dependence on fossil fuels goes well beyond what we pay at the pump. It also includes damage to the environment from drilling and refining oil, as well as from the greenhouse gases released when it is burned.\Just last month, the National Academies of Science released a trio of authoritative reports on global warming.\""A strong, credible body of scientific evidence shows that climate change is occurring, is caused largely by human activities and poses significant risks for a broad range of human and natural systems,"" one of the reports reads.\Ms. Murkowski and her supporters cloak their resolution in a reasonable-sounding argument. Congress, not an administrative agency like the EPA, should set the nation's energy policy and set a strategy for mitigating climate change.\That's true, a point we've previously made in this space. The trouble is that after a decade of trying, Congress has yet to come to grips with the issue. And while a small group of denialists holds the issue hostage, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide continue to rise and the climate continues to warm.\Ms. Murkowski's resolution began its life as an amendment to another piece of legislation. The oil industry helped write it. When, in an effort to win support from moderate Democrats like Ms. McCaskill, Ms. Murkowski's office held a briefing on her proposal last September, the meeting was led by a pair of energy industry lobbyists.\Given what's played out in the Gulf of Mexico over the past 50 days - the disaster spawned by reckless drilling and compounded by dissembling and bungling on the part of BP - it's hard to believe that any politician would follow the oil industry's lead.\If the Senate is serious about addressing climate change, it only has to take up a cap-and-trade bill that already has passed in the House. Failing that, it can adopt an alternative involving a direct carbon tax.\Ms. McCaskill can and should play an important role in deciding the fate of Ms. Murkowski's industry-friendly bill: She should vote against it."
82,"On March 27 , 1977, two 747 airliners collided on a runway at Spain's Tenerife Airport. As far as I know it remains the worst disaster in aviation history, killing 583 people.\A few years later, as a professional military pilot and aircraft commander, I studied this accident in detail as part of an aviation safety seminar. We listened to the cockpit recordings, studied the ""black box"" engine and instrument data, and reviewed the FAA analysis of the accident. The proximate cause of this disaster was a failure of the flight crew to communicate with each other. The conversations in the cockpit showed a hostile environment in which the co-pilot was berated anytime he attempted to say anything to the pilot in command. When the pilot taxied to the runway without clear ance, the co-pilot was afraid to object.\The branch of safety that deals with effective communication is now called Cockpit Crew Coordination. Essentially, when people have to work together to achieve a goal, civil communication is imperative.\As a junior officer in the naval service, I was highly amused when I first went aboard ship at the quaint forms of address and manners that are practiced. When a junior passes a senior in a passageway, he or she is expected to say, ""By your leave, Sir/Madam."" Seating at meals is strictly by seniority, and certain topics are taboo in the wardroom. By the time I became a senior officer, I understood that these polite conventions are the grease that lubricates a very stressful society at sea. Hundreds of people in a small space for months at a time cannot survive without it.\Because of this background, I am deeply troubled by the trend in society toward uncivil discourse. It is tempting to blame it on one political group. We could blame the Hannity/Limbaugh Republicans, with their ""conservatives in exile"" guerrilla politics. We could blame the liberal left, with their name-calling, acerbic commentators such as Jon Stewart and his, ""What the F are they doing?"" Uncivil discourse means we do not respect those on the other side of the argument. It usually means we have closed our minds to any real discussion of issues.\I don't agree with Ron Boyer on global climate change (sorry, Ron!), but I deeply respect him as a person, and I like to think that I remain open-minded on the issue.\Would you like to talk about gun control? Evolution? Abortion? Health care? Cap and trade? The war in Iraq? Great! I am always interested in reasoned discussion. However, if your idea of a discussion is to attack me as a person, start a shoving match and shout louder than me, I'll take a pass. I fear for our country if our people and our politicians lose their understanding of the immense value and necessity of civil discourse.\John B. Moore lives in Brighton."
83,"Lack of security tied to killing of Bhutto A U.N. commission is blaming inadequate security for the 2007 assassination of Pakistan's former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. A report released Monday says her death could have been prevented if the government under then-President Pervez Musharraf, the government of the state of Punjab, and the Rawalpindi District Police had taken adequate measures. Two bombings in Kandahar - Two powerful bombings rocked the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, killing three foreigners and three Afghan soldiers, according to President Hamid Karzai's half brother. NATO forces are gearing up for a major operation this summer in Kandahar, the largest city in the Taliban-ridden south and the birthplace of the hardline Islamist movement. Bombs in Myanmar - Three bomb blasts at a holiday festival killed nine people in Myanmar in the deadliest attack in five years in the country ruled by an iron-fisted regime. State television and radio put the death toll at eight and the injured at 94. Amazon dam delayed - A judge in Brazil suspended bidding on construction and operation of an Amazon dam that would be the planet's third-largest. The ruling also resulted in the suspension of the hydroelectric project's environmental license. The administration of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is vowing to appeal. Charges dropped - A lawyer says Haiti has dropped kidnapping charges against nine of the 10 U.S. missionaries who were arrested trying to take a busload of children out of the quake-ravaged country. The group's leader, Laura Silsby of Boise, Idaho, remains jailed in Haiti. Presidents make case for Haiti - Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush want to increase Haiti's clothing exports to the United States. They are urging Congress to boost the tariff-free quota from 70 million to 250 million square meters and extend an existing deal's expiration from 2018 to 2025. Canada will wait - Canada will not act this year on a cap-and-trade system to control climate change because the government does not expect the U.S. to pass emissions control legislation this year, Canadian environment minister Jim Prentice said. Canada doesn't want to damage its trade relations with the U.S. Hamas executes 2 - The Hamas government executed two men accused of collaborating with Israel, signaling an escalation in the militant Palestinian group's method of controlling the Gaza Strip. Wreckage cleared in Thailand - Thai troops cleared the gutted remains of armored carriers after anti-government protesters vacated the site of last week's bloody clashes and shifted to an upscale shopping district to intensify their campaign to oust the prime minister. Kyrgyzstan president leaves - The deposed president of Kyrgyzstan left the country for neighboring Kazakhstan, allaying fears of a civil war. The presidents of the United States, Russia and Kazakhstan helped arrange for Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev to leave the country. Pirates in limbo - Somali pirates scooped up by U.S. and European warships are sitting in legal limbo on the high seas. Bringing them to the lawless Somali capital for trial is not an option, and Kenya says it won't take any more, though diplomats wonder whether the government in Nairobi may be trying to wring more cash from the international community.\Credit: From news services"
84,"
There is absolutely no doubt that mercury, whether standing alone or in compound with other elements, is harmful to health.
\
It affects the central nervous system - hence the term ""mad as a hatter,"" since hatmakers once used mercury to cure hats. It is especially detrimental to the developing nervous systems of fetuses and young children. It is also an airborne toxic contaminant that federal and state governments refuse to regulate.
\
When the federal government - via the Environmental Protection Agency - tried to regulate mercury, which is emitted mostly by coal-fired power plants, the EPA required that monitors be installed at the smokestacks of the power plants as part of a ""cap and trade"" program. The large companies that own and operate the facilities cried foul and appealed the EPA rule in federal court. Losing in the federal circuit court, they then filed an appeal. The appeals court overturned the lower court decision and threw out all the regulations, deeming that the monitors - the base of the system - would be too expensive to install and that large utility companies would be able to buy their way out of compliance.
\
Missouri - through the Department of Natural Resources - pointed to a provision in state air law that prohibits the state from being ""no more strict than federal."" Various court decisions have ruled that in the absence of a federal law or regulation, Missouri can enact provisions to protect the environment and human health.
\
That's where we stand - no federal or state regulation of mercury. The federal law was deemed expensive and unprotective by a federal appeals court, and the state of Missouri points to a non-applicable law for a reason to do nothing.
\
Meanwhile, the Missouri Department of Conservation and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said in warnings that pregnant women and children should avoid eating more than 1 pound of fish per week from Missouri waters. At the same time, DNR claims its hands are tied and it can do nothing, prevented by ""no stricter than federal"" even though there is no federal law or regulation. How it is possible to be no stricter than nothing escapes me, but then again, the folks at DNR aren't the brightest bulbs in the chandelier.
\
DNR is putting together its ""impaired waters"" list as required under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. While acknowledging that the conservation department and MDHSS have issued a health advisory on fish consumption that applies to every stream, river and lake in the state, DNR is reluctant to list waters impaired by mercury, because they ""can't do much about it.""
\
This is so much blather. Atmospheric deposition of mercury, it is true, might come from the far West or even Southeast Asia, but the heaviest deposits of mercury fall nearest to the emitting coal-fired power plant and only a small amount makes it into the upper atmosphere. Maybe we can't do much about power plants in California or China, but mercury emissions from those in Missouri need to be restricted. That might be enough to repeal the advisories and return our waters (and our people) to health.
\
Unfortunately, the state's efforts will apparently be limited to issuing health advisories recommending that people limit their consumption of fish. What should be done (but is sadly lacking) is to place the burden of limiting atmospheric deposition of mercury on the owners and operators of coal-fired power plants. Instead, the burden is placed on citizens.

85,"COMMENTARY - A FORUM FOR OTHER VOICES, IDEAS AND OPINIONS G. Tracy Mehan III is assistant administrator for water in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington. He served as director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources from 1989 to 1992.\ ENVIRONMENT\ The Bush administration is committed to cleaner water, and supports innovative ways to get faster results at less cost. That is why the Environmental Protection Agency is proposing a new policy to help guide states and American Indian tribes as they use market forces to clean up America's streams, rivers and watersheds.\ Water quality trading uses economic incentives to improve water quality. It allows one source to meet its regulatory obligations by using pollutant reductions created by another source that has lower pollution control costs. The standards remain the same, but efficiency is increased and costs are decreased. Trading is another tool in the toolbox for states and tribes to meet water quality standards.\ This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Clean Water Act. Today, our streams, lakes and rivers are dramatically cleaner. America has spent, and continues to spend, a lot of money on clean water -- at least $48 billion annually to control industrial and municipal sources. But significant water quality challenges remain.\ Water quality trading provides economic incentives for individual landowners and unregulated sources of pollutants to improve water quality.\ Trading is not a license to pollute or to sell pollution. Trading will allow individuals or enterprises to meet their discharge limits by acquiring surplus reductions that are produced elsewhere within that same watershed. Those surplus reductions would be produced by either another facility that is controlling pollution beyond regulatory reductions, or by someone who is not regulated, thus reducing another source's pollutant discharge.\ The policy provides incentives for farmers to adopt soil management and crop practices to reduce the flow of sediment and nutrients into streams. For example, a farmer could plant without tilling the soil, or implement a fertilizer- or manure-management plan and plant vegetative buffers. These reductions in sediment or nutrient loads could then be used by a municipal wastewater facility or industrial discharger to meet its permit limits. And trading can provide other benefits. By not tilling, sediment and nutrient loss due to erosion are reduced. This method of farming also reduces energy consumption and operational costs, it builds the integrity and productivity of the soil, and it reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, buffer strips provide habitat for wildlife and waterfowl.\ In 1994, the Clinton administration estimated that trading would achieve an annual cost savings ranging from $658 million to $7.5 billion.\ An independent study of three watersheds in Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin looked at the cost of controlling phosphorous. This study found that the cost of reducing phosphorous from factories and other sources regulated by the Clean Water Act is considerably higher than reductions through trading with sources that are unregulated.\ Perhaps more important than the money to be saved, however, is the fact that water quality trading will clean the water faster.\ Emissions trading has proven its workability, its worth, and its viability toward improving our air quality. Under the acid rain cap- and-trade program, we have reduced sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants by nearly 34 percent since 1990, while power plant electricity production actually rose by nearly 19 percent. In the lead-in-gasoline phase-down program, emissions trading helped reduce ambient lead in the atmosphere from gasoline by more than 99 percent, and did so far more rapidly and efficiently than a command- and-control approach.\ Using innovative solutions that achieve better results, and achieve them faster and cheaper, should be embraced by all."
86,"The scope of this viewpoint is basic, and looks to essential definitions and concepts; details, later.\Words may be ambiguous. Used to clarify or to obscure, words can be used as weapons, effecting an exchange of ignorance, or used as vehicles conveying knowledge.\Daily we experience the expanding ""information explosion"", often unaware that information does not equal knowledge. Nor does knowledge, no matter how deep, or scientific, convey wisdom.\Americans do not read seriously, and do not even know their own history.\Opinions and sound-bytes of politics, economics and global upheavals are heard on radio or TV, or are glimpsed on newstands. Tragically, a nation unaware of its history is like a man without memory. Each tends to be easily influenced by half-truths.\What do labels as left, right, liberal or conservative, really mean? What are socialism, capitalism or progressivism, and how does one find out?\The broader the information fallout, the greater the risk of misinformation.\The profusion of electronic gadgetry, plus the seductive vanity of hearing one's broadcast voice, aided by the equal inability, by many, to think and then ""shut up"", has led to much ""fuzzy"" public thinking. All too often, the wondrous Internet is peppered with cryptic, splintered blogs, repeating the repetitious.\Of no help are those professional politicians and rascals who thrive on the vagaries of language to garner power by pitting man against man, and offended group against an even more offended group. This is how contracts are signed before reading, how bills are passed without understanding, and how citizens lose their sovereignty. Happens daily.\Another basic: speaking clear and mean ingful English.\For example, what is an ""infomercial"" -- a commercial on steroids? A ""free-gift"" -- why would you pay for a gift?\Health ""coverage"" does not mean ""services""; we now have serious shortages of qualified providers. Health care is not synonymous with medical care:\Health care is what you do for yourself by proper diet, exercise and overall lifestyle. Medical care is what the doctor does for or to you. Health care is your responsibility. Not that of your mother or the government.\How do ideas mutate so quickly? Just a few years ago, ""protest was the highest form of patriotism"". Today, protesters, even veterans, are viewed with suspicion as, ""potential terrorists.""\""It's the economy, stupid!"", was the height of wisdom just a few elections ago. Why is it not now? Bailouts, environment, cap and trade, medical reform -- these do not require a strong economy?\Another basic: Power. Most hot-button issues today can be reduced to: ""Who has the power, the ruthlessness, or even the stupidity, to do what to whom?"" And get away with it.\Finally, the most basic: Human nature.\Are we but ""accidents"" in an impersonal universe; or, is there a purpose to our existence? You may chose your perceived reality, as you wish.\But you cannot change reality. This change you cannot believe in.\Robert S Demski, MD, lives in Lampe.\What do you think?\We've asked for a new From the Right contributor. This is the first trial column from several contenders for the spot. E-mail diseman@news-leader.com with your opinion. We also plan to run an online poll on the hopefuls in the near future."
87,"Ameren Corp., one of the nation's biggest coal-burning electric utilities, said on Friday that steps must be taken to confront global warming. But, in a refrain familiar for the energy industry, it warned that the economic fallout from laws adopted too aggressively, too fast would be severe. \""It could get ugly for our economy and our consumers unless we get this right,"" Dan Cole, Ameren's senior vice president of administration, said in an interview.\St. Louis-based Ameren outlined its position on climate change in a 57-page report - the product of 1 1/2 years of research by its own employees and managers as well as outside climatologists, policy analysts, lawyers and energy experts.\The effort was in part an exercise in corporate planning, but also in anticipation of a request by activist shareholders to assess the risks of climate change legislation. Indeed, the company was asked in late 2006 by investment funds managed by the New York City Comptroller to produce such a report, Cole said.\Ameren, which operates coal-fired power plants that emit about 70 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, supports a federal mandate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But regulations must balance environmental benefits with the interests of its customers and the economy, the company said. \The utility embraces a portfolio of strategies to reduce carbon intensity, from incentives to encourage the use of energy-saving light bulbs to increased use of renewable energy. It's also participating in electric industry research of advanced generation technologies and carbon sequestration. For now, it will not pursue development of any new coal-burning power plants, but still may look to build a new nuclear reactor in central Missouri. \Midwest environmental groups said Ameren's strategy for addressing climate change falls short, particularly in the areas of renewable energy and conservation.\""We're definitely happy to see Ameren addressing the issue,"" said Erin Noble, energy policy analyst and outreach coordinator for the St. Louis-based Missouri Coalition for the Environment. ""But we must be careful not to be persuaded to thinking that with this report that Ameren is doing all it can to pursue a greener or cleaner energy portfolio.""\Ameren's development of 100 megawatts of wind energy by 2010, a step that's required under the rate increase granted by Missouri regulators this summer, is a good start, Noble said. But it barely registers compared with the thousands of megawatts of coal-fired generation the company operates.\Ameren executives believe policies to regulate greenhouse gases should be phased in and allow utilities and factories to trade carbon emissions allowances as well as to offset emissions through reforestation programs. The utility also advocates a national approach to carbon regulation, warning that a regional approach would have ""serious limitations and potentially damaging economic consequences.""\The report specifically cites a pact by Midwest governors last month calling for a regional cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions. Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich of Illinois signed the pact. Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, a Republican, did not.\Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Policy and Law Center in Chicago, said urgent action on climate change is necessary, and states must act swiftly if the federal government doesn't.\""We don't have the luxury of hoping and thinking and wishing and praying that the federal government will step up and act,"" Learner said. ""How long do we wait for Godot?""\Cole, the Ameren executive, said it's more important that regulators vet the issue thoroughly before pushing through new rules, which could have unintended consequences.\Ameren's economic consultant, CRA International, calculated costs associated with various climate-change proposals being discussed in Washington. The analysis, which didn't focus on any specific proposed bill, suggested Midwest wholesale electricity prices could soar as much as 175 percent by 2030. During that same period, customer rates could double and the price of natural gas could soar 90 percent if the most stringent policies were adopted.\""You have to do this right,"" Cole said. ""You don't have to do this tomorrow.""\Credit: Jeffrey Tomich; ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH"
88,"Washington -- Last week, a draft memo surfaced from the Homeland Security Department suggesting ways to administratively circumvent existing law to allow several categories of illegal immigrants to avoid deportation and, indeed, for some to be granted permanent residency. Most disturbing was the stated rationale. This was being proposed ""in the absence of Comprehensive Immigration Reform."" In other words, because Congress refuses to do what these bureaucrats would like to see done, they will legislate it themselves.\Regardless of your feelings on the substance of the immigration issue, this is not how a constitutional democracy should operate. Administrators administer the law; they don't change it. That's the legislators' job.\When questioned, the White House downplayed the toxic memo, leaving the impression that it was nothing more than ruminations emanating from the bowels of Homeland Security. But the administration is engaged in an even more significant power play elsewhere.\A 2007 Supreme Court ruling gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate carbon emissions if it could demonstrate that they threaten human health and the environment. The Obama EPA made precisely that finding, thereby granting itself a huge expansion of power and, noted The Washington Post, sending ""a message to Congress.""\It was not a terribly subtle message: Enact cap-and-trade legislation -- taxing and heavily regulating carbon-based energy -- or the EPA will do so unilaterally. As Frank O'Donnell of Clean Air Watch noted, such a finding ""is likely to help light a fire under Congress to get moving.""\Well, Congress didn't. Despite the ""regulatory cudgel"" (to again quote the Post) the administration has been waving, the Senate has repeatedly refused to acquiesce.\Good for the Senate. But what to do when the executive is passively aggressive rather than actively so?\Take border security. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., reports that President Obama told him about pressure from his political left and its concern that if the border is secured, Republicans will have no incentive to support comprehensive reform (i.e., amnesty). Indeed, Homeland Security's abandonment of the ""virtual fence"" on the southern border, combined with its lack of interest in completing the real fence that today covers only one-third of the border, gives the distinct impression that serious border enforcement is not a high administration priority absent some Republican quid pro quo on comprehensive reform.\But border enforcement is not something to be manipulated in return for legislative favors. It is, as the administration vociferously argued in court in the Arizona case, the federal executive's constitutional responsibility. Its job is to faithfully execute the laws. Nonexecution is a dereliction of duty.\This contagion of executive willfulness is not confined to the federal government or to Democrats. In Virginia, the Republican attorney general has just issued a ruling allowing police to ask about one's immigration status when stopped for some other reason (e.g., a traffic violation). Heretofore, police could inquire only upon arrest and imprisonment.\Whatever your views about the result, the process is suspect. If police latitude regarding the interrogation of possible illegal immigrants is to be expanded, that's an issue for the legislature, not the executive.\How did we get here? I blame Henry Paulson. (Such a versatile sentence.) The gold standard of executive overreach was achieved the day he summoned the heads of the country's nine largest banks and informed them that henceforth the federal government was their business partner. The banks were under no legal obligation to obey. But they know the capacity of the federal government, when crossed, to cause you trouble, endless trouble. They complied.\So did BP when the president summoned its top executives to the White House to demand a $20 billion federally administered escrow fund for damages. Existing law capped damages at $75 million. BP, like the banks, understood the power of the U.S. government. Twenty billion it was.\Again, you can be pleased with the result (I was), and still be troubled by how we got there. Everyone wants energy in the executive (as Alexander Hamilton called it). But not lawlessness. In the modern welfare state, government has the power to regulate your life. That's bad enough. But at least there is one restraint on this bloated power: the separation of powers. Such constraints on your life must first be approved by both houses of Congress.\That's called the consent of the governed. The constitutional order is meant to subject you to the will of the people's representatives, not to the whim of a chief executive or the imagination of a loophole-seeking bureaucrat.\Charles Krauthammer's e-mail address is letters@charleskrauthammer.com."
89,"Illinois sits atop the nation's second-largest coal reserves. Whether that fuel represents the nation's energy future or its past is the subject of an increasingly bitter debate playing out over the nation's airwaves.\Industry groups have been working hard to sell the concept of ""clean"" coal, that is, coal that can be burned using new technologies that reduce or capture and store dangerous emissions. But earlier this month, a coalition of environmental groups concerned about global warming began airing a series of ads built around the slogan ""In reality, there is no such thing as clean coal.""\Those ads prompted the coal industry to fire back with ads of its own: ""The reality: It's here, and it's made coal over 70 percent cleaner.""\At its core, this is a burning debate over how best to meet future energy needs in an era of global warming and a system of carbon emission caps, which almost certainly will be enacted in the near future.\Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States. About half the nation's electricity is generated in coal-fired plants. At current usage rates, the country has sufficient coal reserves to last for centuries.\But coal also is the dirtiest fossil fuel. Newer technologies have reduced the amount chemicals that cause acid rain and smog, which are produced when coal burns. That's what coal companies such as St. Louis-based Peabody Energy and coal-burning electric utilities mean when they talk about cleaner coal.\But chemicals aren't the only problem with the emissions. Each year, coal-fired power plants in the United States also emit 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that causes global warming. That's what environmentalists mean when they say there is no such thing as clean coal.\On average, U.S. coal-fired power plants are 35 years old. Decisions about whether to upgrade or replace them are being made now.\Last week, President-elect Barack Obama named his choices for the key energy and environment posts in his administration. During the campaign, he promised to support a bill to create a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. That would mean setting a price on carbon emissions, which would give utilities an incentive to reduce pollution.\But capturing all or even most of that 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide would be an enormous undertaking. Just a handful of small power plants around the globe are capable of capturing carbon dioxide, and only one or two actually do it.\Among many problems is that 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide takes up an immense amount of space. In a 2007 report, experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that:\- All the carbon dioxide emitted by the nation's coal-fired power plants, if captured for storage, would take up as much space as all the natural gas currently transported over the nation's pipeline system.\- If just 60 percent of the carbon dioxide were compressed into liquid form, it would take up the equivalent of 20 million barrels of oil to hold it.\- Moving captured carbon dioxide from where it is produced to where it would have to be stored would require an investment of billions of dollars. Of course, before that could be done, we would need to have answers to basic questions about where and how to store it.\In Germany in September, a small plant began trapping carbon dioxide from a coal-fired boiler. Eventually, the CO2 will be pumped into a nearly depleted oil field. If all goes well - always a big ""if"" with new technology - experts say the process could become cost-effective in a little more a decade. But that assumes that between now and then, scores of similar plants are built to test and perfect the technology.\It's true that coal-fired plants are cleaner than they used to be, and it is possible - in theory - that they actually will be clean at some point. It is in the nation's interest to pursue that goal. But clean coal is not a reality now, and determining whether it ever can be truly clean will take years."

After rolling up huge legislative majorities and winning local races in places their party had never been successful, Missouri Republicans now face the question of whether they can take statewide offices from Democratic incumbents in 2012.
\
The GOP will have 106 seats in the Missouri House and 26 seats in the Missouri Senate. No party has held majorities of that scale since the 1980s, when Democrats began the decade by winning 117 of 163 House seats in the 1980 election.
\
However, those majorities didn't translate into statewide success, as Republicans won all but one statewide office on the ballot in 1984 and 1988.
\
In 2012, Democrats will be defending Gov. Jay Nixon and U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill as well as incumbents in all the statewide offices on the ballot except lieutenant governor.
\
Lloyd Smith, executive director of the Missouri Republican Party, said in an interview this week that he believes all the Democratic statewide officeholders are vulnerable.
\
He expects President Barack Obama's administration and policies to be as unpopular with voters then as they are now. And he said the party intends to hang those policies around the necks of Nixon and McCaskill.
\
For Nixon, the argument will be that he was silent during debates over health care and environmental legislation known as Cap and Trade, Smith said. No Democratic officeholder opposed those measures, Smith said.
\
""You can't find anyone who stood up tall and said, 'This is bad,'"" Smith said. ""They said yes time and time again to the Obama agenda. While the Obama Administration was taking us down the wrong road, where was the leadership of this state saying stop?""
\
With McCaskill, who was at Obama's side during much of the 2008 campaign, the connection will be even easier to make, Smith said.
\
The high tide of Republican success could rapidly recede, said Smith's counterpart at the Democratic Party, Brian Zuzenak. Nixon won in more than half of Missouri's counties in 2008, he noted, and in the two elections preceding this year's vote, Democrats gained seats in the Missouri House.
\
Nixon will be in a strong position as an incumbent, having faced two years of declining state revenues, making significant budget cuts and avoiding advocacy of higher taxes, Zuzenak said.
\
This year, he said, was just a horrible year for Democrats because of voter unease about the economy and the long-term effect of health care legislation.
\
Republicans succeeded in making local legislative races about the policies coming from Washington, Zuzenak said.
\
""Clearly voters were upset by what they saw in D.C., and they don't like it,"" Zuzenak said. ""They believed Washington D.C. was sort of getting out of control and that made the rest of the ticket suffer. We can separate ourselves from what they see as the typical D.C. Democrat, the president and Speaker Pelosi, to show that.""
\
McCaskill and Nixon, he said, can prove a record of ""serving the needs of Missourians and not acting like folks in D.C. do.""
\
More immediately on the horizon for both parties will be legislative and congressional redistricting. Population figures from the 2010 Census will be released in December, and Missouri will learn then if it will lose a congressional seat. Smith and Zuzenak said they have seen projections going both ways.

Legislative redistricting is handled by separate commissions for the House and Senate. The House commission has two members from each congressional district, one from each party, chosen by Nixon from nominations submitted by each party's congressional district committee. The Senate commission has 10 members, five from each party, chosen by Nixon from nominations made by each party's state committee.
\
The GOP has been working for months to identify potential commissioners and prepare the technical team that will assist them, Smith said.
\
Democrats have been focusing on who to nominate to the commissions as well, Zuzenak said, and working with Congressional district committees to insure that the process works smoothly. A team to deal with the Census data is also being prepared.
\
The Republican-dominated legislature will draw the Congressional map. If the state loses a district, the question will be how to divide the state to maximize the GOP's chances of retaining the six seats it holds. The Democrats' hammer in the process is Nixon, who can veto a map he doesn't like.
\
As they lead in Jefferson City and Washington, Republican majorities need to stay true to conservative principles to remain successful, Smith said.
\
""I honestly believe Missouri is a center-right state,"" he said. ""It is important that conservatives put forward their agenda and once you do that, it may very well be that you have a one-term governor.""
\
Zuzenak isn't conceding any ground. ""The environment is unlikely to be as bad as it was this year. The leaders of the party are on the ball and they are very excited about their ability to differentiate themselves.""

91,"News-Leader\Jefferson City -- Fearing the federal government may soon start taxing carbon emissions, Missouri utility companies are seeking caps on legal liability for injuries suffered from the process of carbon sequestration.\Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from smoke stacks and injecting the harmful greenhouse gases into geological formations.\City Utilities of Springfield is leading a $3 million pilot project to test the viability of the emerging technology at its 1,000-acre power plant on the city's southwest side.\The CU experiment will involve food-grade CO2 -- commonly found in soft drinks -- to see if the process is viable in Missouri, where injection can only take place in shallow deposits 2,000 feet underground.\CU officials and lobbyists for municipal and investor-owned power companies testified Tuesday before a House committee in favor of a bill limiting liabilities for potential accidents resulting from this technology to $2 million per site and $300,000 per individual.\Rep. Shane Schoeller, R-Willard, introduced the legislation, House Bill 896. All of the other Greene County representatives signed on as co-sponsors of the bill, which would benefit City Utilities as it develops the process.\Carbon sequestration projects are taking place in West Virginia and North Dakota. But utilizing those sites to sequester carbon dioxide requires the expensive endeavor of shipping it to those states, CU officials said.\CU officials contend if the experiment in Springfield works, it could help Missouri utility companies reduce greenhouse gases from coal and natural gas power plants and save ratepayers the cost of proposed federal taxes on emissions.\""If we can capture and sequester right here in Missouri, it will save an awful lot of money,"" said John Black, general counsel for City Utilities.\Gary Pendergrass, director of the Missouri Carbon Sequestration Project in Springfield, said the need to reduce greenhouse gases by injecting carbon underground would greatly increase if President Barack Obama can get a cap-and-trade tax on carbon emissions through Congress -- as he vowed to do.\Obama's latest proposal to tax carbon emissions at $115 per ton ""would more than double electric rates in the state,"" said Pendergrass, CU's environmental compliance manager.\""We're faced with tremendous costs if carbon taxes come about,"" Pendergrass told the House Energy and Environment Committee.\Schoeller said the legislation would allow CU and other utility companies to invest in carbon sequestration before the impending federal mandates get imposed. He said utility companies need the liability protection to get insurance coverage for the investment.\CU's carbon sequestration project is a consortium between the federal government and the state's municipal and investor-owned utility companies. The federal government provided $2.4 million for the project, and utility companies kicked in $600,000. The injection of food-grade carbon dioxide won't begin until late 2010 or early 2011, Pendergrass said.\Supporters of the legislation say there is no harm in the process of drilling down 2,000 feet and pumping carbon dioxide emissions into Missouri's sandstone deposits.\But critics of the legislation questioned why the utility companies need legal liability protection if there's no danger involved.\""If there's no risk, there's no harm. If there's no harm, then there's no liability. If there's no liability, then there's no need for a waiver of liability,"" said David Klarich, a lobbyist for the Missouri Association of Trial Attorneys."
92,"What do Americans for Prosperity and MoveOn.org Civic Action have in common? Not political leanings, that's for sure. AFP is hard right, MoveOn is hard left.\Both are registered with the Internal Revenue Service as 501(c)4 organizations. There 26 categories of Section 501(c) organizations, all of them exempt, at least in part, from paying income taxes.\Under IRS regulations, 501(c)4 organizations ""must be operated exclusively to promote social welfare."" Such organizations ""must operate primarily to further the common good and general welfare of the people of the community (such as by bringing about civic betterment and social improvements),"" the regulations say.\That ""promote social welfare"" language leaves a lot of wiggle room, and, increasingly, groups all along the political spectrum - though particularly those on the right - have formed 501(c)4s for blatantly partisan purposes.\Donations to 501(c)4s aren't tax deductible, but the names of donors don't have to be disclosed, and there's no limit on how much donors can give.\Thus, a few wealthy individuals, corporations or labor unions can have a huge influence on political campaigns and issues without being accountable to the public.\Last week, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, asked the IRS to investigate whether 501(c)4s are violating the rules for tax-exempt organizations. Because Mr. Baucus' committee has oversight of the IRS, his ""request"" carries considerable weight.\""With hundreds of millions of dollars being spent in election contests by tax-exempt entities, it is time to take a fresh look at current practices,"" Mr. Baucus wrote to IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman.\The senator noted that law forbids political activity from being the ""primary purpose"" of such tax-exempt organizations. ""These rules prevent private individuals or groups from using tax-exempt organizations to benefit their private interests or to profit from the tax-exempt organization's activities,"" Mr. Baucus wrote.\Oil and energy lobbyists and trade groups for example, have formed dozens of 501(c)4s to oppose the Obama administration's cap-and-trade bill, which would raise their costs.\On the other hand, two years ago, Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., had the minority staff of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee look into the partisan activities of 501(c)4s run by environmental groups. He argued that donors who wanted their money to support environmental causes had no way to know whether their money was going instead to partisan political causes. \But that was in 2008, before a Democrat was elected to the White House. Conservatives like Mr. Inhofe no longer are as concerned with 501(c)4s.\After the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance law limited direct contributions (hard money) to political parties, political activists developed the concept of ""soft money.""\Democrats led the way, using so-called ""527 corporations"" (after a provision in the tax code) to raise money for independent political expenditures. Republicans quickly caught up. But for those who prefer operating in the shadows, 527s had a problem: Donors' names must be disclosed.\Groups that would rather masquerade as ""grass roots"" organizations then seized on using 501(c)4s. Many of them (such as MoveOn.org) also have related 527 organizations or political action committees that are allowed to engage more overtly in political affairs. But donors to 527s and PACs must disclose their names.\Groups whose donors prefer anonymity hide behind the ""astroturf"" roots of 501(c)4s. And since the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, conservatives and business groups, who tend to give money in larger amounts and be far leerier about disclosure than liberals, have embraced them whole-heartedly.\Consider Karl Rove's new ""American Crossroads"" organization. Mr. Rove, the political adviser to former President George W. Bush, formed it as a 527 corporation. Its seed money was $1 million each, fully disclosed, from a corporation controlled by Texas financier Harold Simmons of ""Swiftboat"" fame and from a trust controlled by Jerry Perenchio, founder of Univision, a Spanish-language TV network.\But Mr. Rove quickly spun off ""Crossroads Grassroots Political Strategies,"" a 501(c)4 for donors shy about having their names made public. It already has spent several million dollars ""promoting social welfare"" by attacking Democratic politicians around the country, including Democrat Robin Carnahan in Missouri's U.S. Senate race.\It has been said that money in politics is like water - it always finds a crack to trickle through. But using tax-exempt organizations to hide the identities of donors too cowardly to acknowledge their beliefs must end. We trust Mr. Baucus will hold the IRS to enforcing not only the letter of the law, but also its spirit."
93,"Washington -- Barack Obama's considerable political capital, earned on Election Day 2008, is spent. Well spent, mind you, on the enactment of a highly ideological agenda of Obamacare, financial reform and a near-$1 trillion stimulus that will significantly transform the country. But spent nonetheless. There's nothing left with which to complete his social-democratic ambitions. This would have to await the renewed mandate that would come with a second inaugural.\That's why, as I suggested last week, nothing of major legislative consequence is likely to occur for the next 2 1/2 years. Except, as columnist Irwin Stelzer points out, for one constitutional loophole: a lame-duck Congress called back into session between the elections this November and the swearing-in of the 112th Congress next January.\Leading Democrats are already considering this as a way to achieve even more liberal measures that many of their members dare not even talk about, let alone enact, on the eve of an election in which they face a widespread popular backlash to the already enacted elements of the Obama-Pelosi-Reid agenda.\That backlash will express itself on Election Day and result, as most Democrats and Republicans currently expect, in major Democratic losses. It is still possible for the gaffe-happy Republicans to blow it. When the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee publicly apologizes to the corporation that unleashed the worst oil spill in American history, you know the Republicans are capable of just about anything.\But assuming the elections go as currently projected, Obama's follow-on reforms are dead. Except for the fact that a lame-duck session, freezing in place the lopsided Democratic majorities of November 2008, would be populated by dozens of Democratic members who had lost re-election (in addition to those retiring). They could then vote for anything -- including measures they today shun as the midterms approach and their seats are threatened -- because they would have nothing to lose. They would be unemployed. And playing along with Obama might even brighten the prospects for, say, an ambassadorship to a sunny Caribbean isle.\As John Fund reports in The Wall Street Journal, Sens. Jay Rockefeller, Kent Conrad and Tom Harkin are already looking forward to what they might get passed in a lame-duck session. Among the major items being considered are card check, budget-balancing through major tax hikes and climate-change legislation involving heavy carbon taxes and regulation.\Card check, which effectively abolishes the secret ballot in the workplace, is the fondest wish of a union movement to which Obama is highly beholden. Major tax hikes, possibly including a value-added tax, will undoubtedly be included in the recommendations of the president's debt commission, which conveniently reports by Dec. 1. And carbon taxes would be the newest version of the cap-and-trade legislation that has repeatedly failed to pass the current Congress -- but enough dead men walking in a lame-duck session might switch and vote to put it over the top.\It's a target-rich environment. The only thing holding the Democrats back would be shame, a Washington commodity in chronically short supply. To pass in a lame-duck session major legislation so unpopular that Democrats had no chance of passing it in regular session -- after major Democratic losses signifying a withdrawal of the mandate implicitly granted in 2008 -- would be an egregious violation of elementary democratic norms.\Perhaps shame will constrain the Democrats. But that is not to be counted on. It didn't stop them from pushing through a health-care reform the public didn't want by means of ""reconciliation"" maneuvers and without a single Republican vote in either chamber -- something unprecedented in American history for a reform of such scope and magnitude.\How then to prevent a runaway lame-duck Congress? Bring the issue up now -- applying the check-and-balance of the people's will before it disappears the morning after Election Day. Every current member should be publicly asked: In the event you lose in November -- a remote and deeply deplorable eventuality, but still not inconceivable -- do you pledge to adhere to the will of the electorate and, in any lame-duck session of Congress, refuse to approve anything but the most routine legislation required to keep the government functioning?\The Democrats could, of course, make the pledge today and break it tomorrow. Call me naive, but I can't believe anyone would be that dishonorable.\Charles Krauthammer's e-mail address is letters@charles krauthammer.com. (c) 2010, The Washington Post Writers Group"
94,"""We've got the packages written. We're waiting right now to put a name in.""\- Conservative activist Richard Viguerie, in The New York Times May 16, explaining plans to oppose whomever President Barack Obama nominated to the Supreme Court.\Chairman Leahy: This hearing of the Committee on the Judiciary will come to order. We are here to consider the president's appointment of St. Francis of Assisi as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court.\Frankly, the chair was a bit surprised that the president would appoint a non-lawyer, and indeed, a non-citizen of the United States, to the court. Further, the chair notes that the nominee has been dead for 782 years. But given the nominee's sterling reputation - the chair believes this is the first time a saint ever has appeared before Congress - we are prepared to waive the formalities and hear your opening statement.\The Nominee: Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there is sadness, joy.\Grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.\Chairman Leahy: Very moving, sir. The chair is inspired to move that the committee confirm this witness by acclamation.\Mr. Sessions: Not so fast, Mr. Chairman. There have been a lot of questions raised about this witness since the president nominated him. This animal thing, for example. I understand, sir, that you talk to birds and wolves. Out in the Western states of this great union, wolves are seen as a pestilence. Do you agree that ranchers should be able to protect their flocks?\Further, it is my understanding that you are the patron saint of ecology and the environment. How do you stand on the job-killing cap-and-trade bill? Do you believe that a few polar bears are more important than jobs?\Mr. Hatch: I'd like to know more about how your own upbringing and life experience will affect your view of the law. For example, you walked away from a life of wealth to live a life of poverty. Does that mean you reject the fundamentals of capitalism that have so enriched this nation?\Also, I understand that early in your life, you gave away everything you owned to a beggar. While I admire that generosity, it raises serious questions about your view of the nation's obligations to provide cradle-to-grave alms and velvet cloaks to all of its citizens.\Mr. Grassley: I'd like to pick up that point, Mr. Chairman, and introduce into the record a column written by Karl Rove, the famous political thinker, in the May 28 edition of The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Rove notes that the president said he wanted a nominee with ""empathy"" who'd temper the court's decisions with a concern for the downtrodden, the powerless and the voiceless.\As Mr. Rove writes, ""'Empathy' is the latest code word for liberal activism, for treating the Constitution as malleable clay to be kneaded and molded in whatever form justices want.""\In short, Mr. Chairman, we don't need no stinkin' empathy.\Mr. Kyl: I'd like to say that while I am very impressed with the nominee's life experiences, I am troubled by the fact that in 1201, while a member of an army, he spent a year as a prisoner of war. Given his troubling record of empathy, how would this experience affect his view of the treatment of terrorist prisoners held at Guantanamo? And if he was tortured as a prisoner, does he not agree that waterboarding isn't all that bad?\Mr. Graham: I would point out the nominee's suspicious record of empathy also extends to Muslims. I note that in 1219, he led a pilgrimage of non-violence to Egypt, then as now a Muslim land, where he was received by the Muslim leaders. In doing so, he interrupted a holy crusade. Frankly, I am worried that the nominee would be soft on Islamo-fascist terror.\Dr. Coburn: I join in those international concerns, but I worried about a domestic issue, and that is the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman. According to this biography, the witness once told his friends that he was considering marrying a ""fairer bride than any of you have ever seen.""\Now, if empathy is code for judicial activism, I think we can guess what this is code for.\Chairman Leahy: Let the record show that the witness has suddenly vanished. The president has sent over a substitute nominee. The chair calls Mother Teresa of Calcutta.\Ms. Feinstein: About your opposition to abortion...."
95,"NEW YORK * Da ""Yoopers"" up in da U.P., Michigan's Upper Peninsula, have hit it big with inclusion of their nickname in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary and online database.\The moniker for native or longtime residents of the Lake Superior region known for a distinctive manner of speaking and its Scandinavian roots was among about 150 new words announced Monday by the Springfield, Mass., company.\The update of the Collegiate's 11th edition pleased Yooper Steve Parks, the prosecutor in Delta County, Mich., who pushed for more than a decade to have the word recognized. Supporters splashed their joy online when news of the higher profile spread in March.\""People up here, we really do have our own identity and our own culture,"" Parks said. ""We're a really hardy bunch. We love the land, we love the lakes, we love hunting, we love fishing. You have to be very resilient to live up here.""\But really? Is Yooper as recognizable as, say, the Yankees of New England? Peter Sokolowski, a lexicographer for Merriam-Webster, insists it has crossed from regional to more general usage. ""Plus, it's just a really colorful word,"" he said.\But there was a bit of a Yooper blooper.\The suggested pronunciation in the new entry lacks the ""p,"" though the entry itself is spelled correctly. Meghan Lunghi, a spokeswoman for Merriam-Webster, said in an email : ""Yes, unfortunately a 'p' is missing from the pronunciation. The rest of the entry is fine.""\Many of the other new words and terms stem from digital life and social media spoiler alert, hashtag, selfie and tweep while others are food-driven, including pho and turducken, a boneless chicken stuffed into a boneless duck stuffed into a boneless turkey.\Climate change and the environment did not go unnoticed, with the addition of cap-and-trade, a system that limits the amount of carbon emissions companies can produce but allows them to buy emissions credits from others.\Fracking also made it into the update. So did e-waste and freegan, one who scavenges for free food in store and restaurant trash bins as a way to reduce consumption of resources.\""It's a young word, from 2006,"" Sokolowski said of freegan. ""It's one of the youngest in this list. This kind of environmentalism was a Lone Ranger type of activity before but has taken off.""\Merriam-Webster relies on a network of observers who track down word usage in everything from newspapers to soup can labels. Three or four senior editors make the final cut.\Other new words in the popular dictionary and at Merriam-webster.com: Catfish (one who takes on a false online identity, a la the phantom girlfriend of football pro Manti Te'o); poutine, a French-Canadian snack of fries covered with brown gravy and cheese curds; steampunk, a literary genre with dress-up followers that mashes up 19th-century societies with steam-powered technology; unfriend, which joins defriend; and hot spot, a place where Wi-Fi is available.\Credit: Associated Press"
96,"The nation's two largest coal companies and one of the largest coal-burning utilities agreed to give Washington University $12 million over five years to help make the St. Louis area a hub for clean-coal research.\Peabody Energy Corp. and Arch Coal Inc. will contribute $5 million apiece, and Ameren Corp. will provide $2 million to help establish the Consortium for Clean Coal Utilization, university Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton announced Tuesday at a news conference on the school's campus.\Coal is burned to produce half of the nation's electricity, and global demand is expected to rise sharply over the next 20 years. But burning coal is a major source of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas associated with global warming. And scientists urge steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dire environmental consequences.\Wrighton and energy company executives said the dual challenges of keeping the world's economy running and halting or reversing climate change necessitates advances in technology.\""I see this as one of the most important challenges, if not the most important challenge of this century - providing abundant affordable energy without adverse consequences to the environment,"" Wrighton said.\The consortium's goal is advancing education and research that help make available clean-coal technology - specifically, the ability to capture harmful carbon dioxide and pump it underground or use it to enhance oil recovery.\""Technology is the critical enabling solution,"" said Steven F. Leer, chief executive of Creve Coeur-based Arch Coal Inc. ""If you're serious about stabilizing CO2 in the atmosphere, we have to develop the technology.""\Advances in coal-combustion technology over the last 40 years have helped achieve big cuts in emissions of other pollutants, including sulfur dioxide and mercury, Leer said. He believes similar cuts in carbon dioxide emissions are possible. \Some environmentalists and opponents of coal say the term ""clean coal"" is an oxymoron, and the concept of a fossil fuel that's almost emissions-free is a mirage - something that will always be out of reach, economically if not technologically.\Energy executives at Washington University said Tuesday that the technology to strip carbon dioxide from coal and pump it underground exists. They said more testing and research is necessary to reduce the cost so it can be widely deployed.\President-elect Barack Obama has urged implementation of a cap-and-trade program to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent from 1990 levels by midcentury. \""Those kind of cuts are significant and will require technology to be able to achieve them,"" Ameren Chief Executive Gary L. Rainwater said. ""You can't do it any other way.""\Obama also has called for partnerships between government and industry to build commercial-scale coal power plants able to capture carbon dioxide and store it in the ground. One such partnership, dubbed FutureGen, was scrapped by the U.S. Department of Energy earlier this year and overhauled - a move that's expected to delay the project by years.\For Ameren and other utilities that rely on coal to generate electricity, the clock is ticking. In fact, the likelihood of carbon emission limits and costs of burning coal are a big reason why AmerenUE, the company's Missouri utility, is pursuing a second nuclear reactor near Fulton, Mo., at an estimated cost of more than $6 billion.\Rainwater and the other energy executives said the money committed to Washington University on Tuesday represents a tiny fraction of the billions of dollars needed to accelerate clean-coal technology.\The Clean Air Task Force, a Boston-based advocacy group, says 20 gigawatts of coal-fueled generation (more than a dozen large power plants) with carbon capture and sequestration technology must be installed by 2020 to meet longer-term carbon reduction goals, said John Thompson, director of the group's coal transition program.\To do that, the group estimates that more than $100 billion of investment in clean-coal technology is required over the next decade.\""It is a daunting task, but it is one that is actually quite solvable,'"" said Thompson, who works in Carbondale, Ill. ""But we have to muster the political will to do it now.""\The clean-coal consortium announced Tuesday it will operate as part of Washington University's International Center for Advanced Renewable Energy and Sustainability, established in June 2007.\The $60 million committed to the center will help fund six new professors. The center will be housed in a 150,000-square-foot building to be completed next year.\Credit: Jeffrey Tomich; ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH"
97," A new round of warnings about global warming catastrophes on the heels of an environmental-friendly Supreme Court ruling Monday has stoked an already simmering debate in Congress about the urgency of climate-change legislation.\ In a fast-shifting political landscape, environmental experts asked: Will the Democratic-run Congress act before it's too late? And does the Bush administration truly understand the implications of a warming planet?\ ""This is a real one-two punch,"" Dan Lashof, a global warming expert for the National Resources Defense Council, said of recent developments.\ The week began with a Supreme Court ruling repudiating the White House for its lack of action on classifying carbon dioxide as a pollutant. The ruling could force the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon emissions along the lines of other pollutants.\ On Friday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of more than 2,000 scientists, released a policy guide for governments outlining potentially devastating effects around the world - with less serious but still consequential changes in the Midwest.\ The report describes a world where climate change may be global, but effects will be largely local.\ In Congress, an array of bills to regulate greenhouse gases is moving through committees.\ Lashof said he sees momentum building in both the Senate and House for limits on emissions of carbon pollution. He expressed optimism that such legislation could see the light of day before the end of the Bush administration.\ ""We've probably waited longer than we should have and we need to get moving right away,"" he said.\ Any legislation to cap emissions on carbon dioxide faces resistance from the automotive industry and coal producers. Such bills will be closely watched in the coal fields of Illinois and in St. Louis, home to the nation's two biggest coal companies, Peabody Energy Corp. and Arch Coal Inc.\ Steve Tomaszewski, a spokesman for Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., said the congressman has worked to remind coal-state Democrats that coal-based energy, although it is the highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the country, will play a big part in America's energy future.\ ""Don't go out there trying to wipe coal from our natural energy portfolio,"" Tomaszewski said.\ He said Shimkus will attempt to hold House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to her word that so-called cap-and-trade emissions legislation - which gives industry flexibility within ever- declining pollution limits - would not reach the House floor for a vote before summer.\ Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and sponsored the most sweeping emission- control legislation to date, said Friday that the new scientific report underscores the urgency of Congress addressing global warming.\ 'An embarrassment'\ The Bush administration, teaming up with representatives from Saudi Arabia and China, dove into a tussle to tone down the language of the report, going head-to-head with the report's authors.\ At one point, Chinese officials insisted the report remove the word ""very"" from a phrase stating that scientists had ""(very) high confidence that many natural systems, on all continents and in most oceans, are being affected by regional climate changes.""\ ""The report's three authors refused to accept the change,"" Paty Romero, an author of the report, told reporters. ""This resulted in an hours-long deadlock that was broken by a compromise to delete any reference to confidence levels.""\ Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., lashed out at the Bush administration's efforts to tamper with the science of climate change.\ ""This is the latest example of the Bush Administration trying to change the science to fit their ideological agenda,"" Kerry said in a statement. ""It's an embarrassment.""\ The Bush administration's Sharon Hays, who spoke for the White House at the climate panel proceedings, played down the proposed changes to the report, asserting during a news conference that U.S. officials ""helped craft a report that robustly reflects the findings of this underlying, very long, technical document.""\ Midwest flooding, heat\ The report by the scientific panel presented findings by geographical region. The Midwest would be insulated to a large degree from the immediate effects of an increase in temperature because of its moderate climate and an economic ability to adapt.\ But responding to a question from the Post-Dispatch, authors warned that the St. Louis region could experience an increased risk of flooding, more frequent heat waves and greater levels of air pollution.\ In the United States, the Southwest and West are more likely to feel the immediate impact of receding snow caps, depleting water stores and long dry spells.\ The scientists spoke matter-of-factly about the possibility of a 7- to 24-inch rise in sea levels, which would lead to more coastal flooding and threaten wetlands.\ Jonathan Patz, a professor at the University of Madison- Wisconsin, stressed the need for human adaptation to solve the climate crisis.\ Some of those adaptations might be not all bad, he said, citing the Supreme Court's ruling that carbon dioxide should be listed as a health hazard, alongside the fact that the United States' number one epidemic is obesity and sixty percent of the nation's car trips are less than one mile.\ ""When it comes to our health, I see a triple-win opportunity here,"" Patz said. ""Imagine walking that trip instead of driving. You could improve personal fitness, reduce local air pollution and reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming.""\ Credit: Grant Slater; POST-DISPATCH WASHINGTON BUREAU"
98,"City Utilities awaiting decision on mercury emissions from power plants.\Wes Johnson, News-Leader\Christi Kelley took her 2-year-old son Cameron to Fellows Lake recently, hoping he'd catch something worth keeping.\She had no idea some of the large bass in the lake -- and in lakes and rivers across Missouri -- may be tainted with toxic mercury.\""I've never heard anything about this,"" said Kelley, a comment echoed by several other anglers at the lake. ""I should learn more about it since I do like to fish.""\According to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, 44 states have issued fish consumption advisories because of worrisome levels of mercury in predatory fish.\Although a certain amount of mercury -- a toxic heavy metal -- occurs naturally, it also is pumped into the atmosphere by coal-burning power plants, a variety of industrial processes and vehicle exhaust.\But for the first time, the Environmental Protection Agency is poised to begin regulating mercury emissions in power plants. And that could have a significant cost impact on the proposed 300-megawatt coal-fired power plant that City Utilities wants voters to approve on Aug. 3.\Federal regulators have yet to decide how strict those mercury controls should be.\Environmental groups want a standard that would remove 90 percent of mercury from power-plant smokestacks.\Another proposal, backed by the Bush administration, would lower that limit to 70 percent and give power plants a longer time to meet the standard.\Dave Fraley, City Utilities' director of environmental compliance, said CU has budgeted funds to pay for a mercury-removal system if voters approve building the $578.5 million Southwest 2 power plant.\""Right now we're looking at taking powdered activated charcoal and injecting it into the flue gas stream,"" Fraley said. ""The activated carbon absorbs the mercury, and we then trap and collect the carbon in a bag house.""\The carbon would be buried at the Springfield landfill.\Because mercury bonds tightly with activated carbon, Fraley said there was little risk of the metal leaching out once it was buried.\The proposed Southwest 2 power plant would use several tons of activated carbon a day, Fraley said. He acknowledged activated carbon was an expensive commodity but said CU planners have factored that cost into the plant's construction and financing plan.\""If something better or cheaper comes along, we'll use it,"" he said.\Scott Miller, CU senior manager/electric, said $1 million has been set aside to build an activated carbon system.\An additional $6 million a year has been budgeted to buy the activated carbon.\Without any mercury-control system, Southwest 2 would emit about 152 pounds of mercury a year, Miller said.\With the activated carbon system, that number could drop to between 30 and 70 pounds a year, depending on how efficiently the carbon actually works.\Waiting for new rules\Because the EPA hasn't regulated mercury emissions before, Miller said technology is still being developed to meet future rules.\One costly concept uses gold-impregnated bags to chemically bind mercury from flue gases. Wet scrubbers that use water to strip away flue particles can remove some mercury, but not nearly as much as activated carbon, Miller said.\""We won't know until Dec. 15, and maybe not until March what the EPA will require,"" he said.\Miller hopes the rules will come soon enough to give CU engineers a chance to decide which mercury removal system would be best and most cost-effective.\Another unknown: Will the existing Southwest and James River power plants be forced to meet the new mercury rules? ""That's a possibility,"" Miller said.\Two scenarios are unfolding in Washington. One would require older plants, such as Southwest and James River, to install mercury-removal technology on-site. Another, called a cap-and-trade system, would allow plants that install mercury systems to sell pollution ""credits"" to those that don't. The concept could reduce overall mercury emissions in a region.\James River and Southwest currently emit about 100 pounds of mercury each per year.\The issue of mercury\The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services first issued a fish consumption advisory for Missouri waters in 2001.\It updated its advisory this year, warning pregnant women, women who might become pregnant, nursing mothers and children 12 and younger not to eat any largemouth bass larger than 12 inches in length.\Georgeanne Bowman, environmental specialist with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, said mercury-contaminated fish is a genuine concern.\""In the United States, 150 tons of mercury are released into the atmosphere every year -- 50 tons of that from coal plants,"" she said.\Airborne mercury eventually falls to earth and washes into lakes and streams.\Waterborne bacteria take up the mercury and convert it into methyl mercury, a form that's easily absorbed by muscle tissue in animals.\Mercury can't be trimmed out or cooked out of contaminated fish.\""It works its way up the food chain, getting more concentrated as bigger fish eat smaller fish that already have mercury in their bodies,"" she said.\The 2001 Missouri fish survey found that big largemouth bass, one of the most popular of the state's game fish, had the highest levels of mercury.\Bass under 12 inches in length are safe to cook, according to DHSS, because they've not eaten enough smaller fish to magnify mercury levels in their bodies.\According to the EPA, mercury can cause neurological damage in humans. Children and fetuses are particularly susceptible.\Mercury can slow a child's ability to learn, affect memory and attention span and impair developing motor functions.\According to the DNR, 80 percent of the mercury found in Missouri lakes and streams comes from coal-burning plants, industrial boilers, medical waste incinerators and municipal trash incinerators.\Seeking cleaner air\Stan Van Velsor, spokesman for Southwest Missouri Citizens for Clean Energy, said he hopes CU is forced to use a ""best available control technology"" standard.\""I would like to see them control mercury at the 90 percent level,"" he said.\Although coal is probably the cheapest fossil fuel to buy, Van Velsor said that wouldn't be the case if all of its environmental impact costs were considered.\""Do citizens really know what the consequences are to their health and the environment from burning coal?"" he asked.\""If those costs were made clear to them, I think they would be more willing to pay more for electricity that comes from cleaner technology.""\If Springfield could reduce its energy demand by 10 to 20 percent through energy conservation and use of renewable fuels like solar and wind power, the city could postpone the need for a new power plant until 2015, he contended.\second of three Parts\TODAY\More utilities\consider option of coal. 3A\Environmentalists want to see tighter pollution controls. 3A\Tuesday\What happens if voters reject CU's request?\On the Web\Background articles about CU's plans for a new power plant.

After four decades of environmental law experience, Maxine Lipeles will retire Monday from Washington University, where she is the longtime director and founder of the university's Interdisciplinary Environmental Clinic -- a pro bono legal practice that tracks issues related to the environment and community health.\The Post-Dispatch asked Lipeles for overarching thoughts about policy trends and ecological changes she has witnessed during her career as a prominent environmental lawyer and watchdog in Missouri.\The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\PD: I'm curious to hear some of your big-picture thoughts as your career as an environmental watchdog draws to a close. Looking back on it, is there a particular feeling you're left with, or a specific achievement that comes to mind, or a lingering concern? What stands out the most to you?\ML: I'll start with the positive and then go to the negative, in terms of lingering concerns. I think the most positive thing that the clinic has done … is to help communities and citizens have a more effective voice in federal and state decisions.\In terms of specific accomplishments, I think maybe the No. 1 thing was our work in Herculaneum (Doe Run announced in 2010 it would close a smelter there) -- both in helping the community to advocate for the people who are most affected by the lead pollution to get a buyout so that they could move, because the community was just so contaminated that it was just unhealthy for people to live there, and also the lawsuit against the EPA that forced a revision to the lead standard for the first time since 1978, and EPA reduced it by 90%. That has a national impact.\There's still a lot to do on the lead issue. … We helped a group that doesn't exist anymore, St. Louis Lead Coalition, to draft a bill which was actually adopted and signed by Gov. (Bob) Holden that required kids at risk to be tested for lead poisoning and we drafted a report for them which took several years to prepare, highlighting the way that the city of St. Louis basically used kids as lead detectors and called for the need for primary prevention, where you prevent kids from being lead poisoned by lead in the first place, as opposed to secondary prevention, which is what the city was using, and still largely continues to use, which is when a kid tests showing lead poisoning, the city responds in an imperfect way. Big picture, I think lead is an area where the clinic had some impact.\One of my observations has been that with the exception of the state's successful negotiation with Doe Run to require Doe Run to offer buyouts to people that lived within about a quarter-mile of the smelter there, the state has been reticent to take on big companies, and I see a lot of the enforcement is against the smaller companies or mom-and-pop operations and the bigger companies, I think the state is afraid to take them on. \The other huge concern is climate. ... Our state is way behind the curve on this, which is harming public health and also, I think ultimately, will harm our economy, because this is where the economy is moving and we're going to be behind the rest of the country and the rest of the world, really, in upgrading our economy to a more sustainable energy structure. So that's a big concern.\I guess the other huge concern is environmental justice. I don't know that the state or EPA has really recognized how significant that concern is and how the environmental harms fall more harshly and to a greater extent on people of color and low-income people in the country, and how that ties in with other systemic issues. ... I think environmental justice gets lip service but nothing more than that, and that's a big problem.\PD: How about overall environmental quality? Obviously you mentioned concerns with climate, but we see and hear a lot of things to be alarmed about these days. Are things getting better or worse, or are they as bad as they sometimes seem?\ML: I think probably some things are getting better, but I think our understanding of environmental impacts and public health impacts is also developing. So for example, air pollution concentrations may be lower than they were 40 years ago, but we now understand that exposure to air pollutants causes harms at lower and lower levels than we knew before. ... The biggest concern is climate, and that's something that's going to require a lot of effort.\PD: To zoom in on Missouri itself, do you think there's less oversight of state-level environmental policy and operations today -- whether from government itself, or from outside groups, like the environmental clinic?\ML: To some extent that's EPA's role, and under the current administration, EPA has pretty expressly walked away from that role, so that's a concern that I'm hoping is a temporary concern. ... The clinic, clearly, is going to continue to play its oversight role on behalf of our clients and also Great Rivers Environmental Law Center, they've been doing that as well.... And there are some others who do that as well.\There's always been a role for citizen voices in the process to encourage EPA to do its job. ... I think there has been growth in terms of the citizen role over the past decades in Missouri, but unfortunately there's been not a corresponding increasing in the state's role or, most recently, in the federal role.\PD: Does that perspective ring true across different administrations in Missouri and different parties being in control?\ML: For the time that I've been practicing here, pretty much, yes. There have been times where the state has tried to do more. When Steve Mahfood was the director of DNR, he was a good director and tried to do what he could. … In the past several decades, the state legislature has been, overall, fairly hostile to environmental considerations and very receptive to regulated industries, with all kinds of bills to roll back protections. And a lot of oversight of DNR, it's almost like a sport during the legislative session for them to call DNR for hearings and put them on the defensive.\PD: Speaking of climate, is there a single biggest policy you advocate for to help address the issue?\ML: I'm not an economist and I don't really have a good sense of what's the best policy way of achieving our goals. So I think for me, the more important thing is we take meaningful action, rather than the specifics of if it's a tax or rebate or cap and trade. The perfect is the enemy of the good. We could debate forever what is the best thing, but we're not even having a debate at this point. So we need to have a debate, and adopt something. … There just isn't the political will on the national level in Congress and in the administration. We've got plenty of information to devise a meaningful federal plan, and we need to do it.\CREDIT: By Bryce Gray, St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
100,"Republicans flushed with excitement over John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin for a running mate are gathering here to nominate a presidential candidate who has sometimes thumbed his nose at what conservatives and the modern GOP stood for.\But the choice of Palin could go a long way toward bridging the gap between McCain and social conservatives, according to Phyllis Schlafly and other conservative leaders. \Schlafly, of St. Louis, one of the nation's most prominent conservatives, could barely contain her glee Friday after watching McCain introduce Palin.\""She's a complete package, right on all the issues, particularly pro-life and drilling for more oil,"" said Schlafly, who heads the Republican National Coalition For Life.\The surprise choice of Palin is risky but could be significant. Since Ronald Reagan in 1980, Republicans have captured five of seven presidential elections thanks to a coalition bound together by social issues and a staunch belief in limited government.\But in McCain, the GOP has a different sort of candidate, one who has been at odds with the Christian right and mainstream Republicans alike but still embraces many core conservative beliefs on matters such as abortion and national security.\McCain's challenge this week, delegates and conservative leaders say, will be unifying party factions and bridging the so-called enthusiasm gap with Democrats. The choice of Palin could help on both fronts, said Rep. John Shimkus, R-Collinsville, calling her selection ""a slam dunk.""\He added: ""Conservatives have to leave St. Paul excited and pleased. As much as I know John McCain is a conservative, there are others who don't believe that.""\Indeed, McCain has the mission of smoothing a relationship with conservatives that has been frayed at times and often nonexistent. Conservatives don't like his commitment to campaign finance reform. He riled them in pushing what critics call his ""mass-amnesty"" immigration bill. He has not been close to conservative leaders personally.\Now many in the Republican Party, conservatives and moderates alike, are suspicious of McCain's pro-environment leanings and his backing of so-called cap-and-trade legislation forcing new anti-global warming constraints on industries.\Yet McCain had made strides in appeasing the right-leaning elements of his party even before bringing Palin aboard, polls and conservative leaders suggest.\David Keene, president of the American Conservative Union, said that some of McCain's progress ""is more related to his opponent than him. But one day he'll reach out, and on another day he'll pull back.""\Keene said that the success of the convention will have a lot to do with how conservatives approach the fall campaign.\""Will they drag their neighbors to the polls?"" Keene said. ""Will they go out and do that for him? I think that more of them would today than when he locked up the nomination. But there is still a lot of room for improvement."" \Apart from \the party\Nonetheless, McCain's distance from party orthodoxy in recent years may be what kept his candidacy afloat in a time of sagging GOP fortunes. Indeed, polls show McCain running far better than Republicans in general in an election in which a bad economy and so-called Bush fatigue suggests a banner Democratic year.\When pollsters for six major surveys asked voters in August which political party they intended to vote for in congressional elections in November, Democrats came out on top by margins ranging from 7 to 18 percent.\But McCain, after a strong month of campaigning, has drawn all but even in his contest with Obama, polls show.\Former Missouri Sen. John Danforth will be a delegate for McCain, the first time he has attended a GOP convention as a delegate since 1984. Danforth thinks he understands why the Republican Party is out of favor with voters: A struggling economy, high gas prices, and weariness of war add up to a general desire for change.\But Danforth said he believes that disenchantment will abate ""when it gets down to one-on-one combat between Obama and McCain and the question of which one they want in the White House. My hope is that the convention will be more than just hoopla and that it will be able to further clarify the differences."" \That's what Republicans will seek to do starting Monday night with speeches by President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney that likely will seek to burnish McCain's leadership image, an advantage already that has helped him draw even in polls.\On Tuesday, Rudy Giuliani's keynote speech recalling the specter of 9/11 is part of the GOP effort this week to highlight ongoing dangers in the world, stressing the ability of McCain, a former POW, to combat terrorism.\Then on Wednesday, the nation will have an opportunity to hear Palin in a performance that could help McCain significantly in swing states, strategists say.\The need for reunification is especially great in Missouri, where McCain was drubbed in the primary by Mike Huckabee, particularly in the southwestern part of the state.\GOP strategist John Hancock, who headed Missouri's Republican Party, said that Palin ""truly establishes this ticket as a reform ticket, and probably does so better than any other potential vice presidential candidate he could have picked. I am as certain as I have ever been that the Republican base is going to turn out for this ticket.""\The Rev. Harold Hendrick, a Christian broadcasting talk show host in St. Louis on the Bott Radio Network, called Palin ""very similar to Huckabee. I think conservatives are wonderfully invigorated in these first few hours, according to what I'm sensing and hearing.""\An iPhone moment?\Young Republicans also hope that McCain and the Republicans devote energy to winning over younger voters, where Obama holds a decided edge.\David All, 29, a GOP consultant on hand for the convention, noted that he was a 9-year-old practicing kick-flips on his skateboard in Reagan's last year in office. ""The party needs to turn around this narrative about how the youths don't care about the Republican Party,"" he said.\How? Perhaps, said All, by doing a better job this week of communicating with young voters via the Internet. ""Maybe McCain should pull out an iPhone during his speech and make a joke about it,"" All said.\Jim Durbin, 35, of Chesterfield, is a media consultant who operates 24thstate.com, a political blog. He's also a disenchanted conservative waiting to be won over by more emphasis on limiting government regulation and taxes. ""I would love to be a Republican, but they don't speak to me,"" he said.\Republicans in St. Paul will be aiming barbs at Obama, but Durbin believes the party could go overboard. ""I don't want a campaign focused entirely on Obama. That would be a train-wreck and I think they would lose if they do that ... I would love to see McCain focus on what is great about this country.""\---\Republican National Convention\Daily highlights, 7-10 p.m.\Monday\Theme: Country First: Service.\Headline speaker: President George W.

101,"WASHINGTON - When asked in their debates about fixing the ailing economy, John McCain and Barack Obama quickly brought up ambitious energy plans in their short lists of prescriptions.\McCain spoke excitedly about the prospect of building 45 nuclear reactors in a little more than two decades, a nuclear renaissance that he says will dramatically reduce imports of oil and exports of cash to countries that don't hold the United States in high regard.\Obama moved quickly to proposals for more federal support for alternative energy sources like wind and solar and more government subsidies for biofuels and clean coal. \Both candidates promise to tackle climate change with programs that force industries to reduce pollution, albeit with the flexibility that enables them to buy and sell pollution credits. \But what neither candidate is saying much about is how the jarring changes in the economy could make it difficult or impossible to achieve their energy blueprints anytime soon.\The government's $700 billion commitment to prop up banks almost certainly will lead to new spending priorities, energy experts say. Programs that sounded appealing - even essential - just weeks ago might no longer muster support in Congress as it tries to pay for the bailout while supporting Medicaid, Medicare and the many other social programs Americans demand. \When it comes to the environment, struggles by businesses to survive the recession could diminish the political will to fight global warming with new regulations. And plummeting oil prices could dampen the fervor surrounding renewable energy sources.\The economic atmosphere could make it more difficult for either McCain or Obama to secure the subsidies for clean-coal research, which is important for the coalfields of Southern Illinois and the coal industry leaders that make their headquarters in St. Louis.\Likewise, securing financing for new nuclear reactors proposed for the Callaway Power Plant near Fulton, Mo. - and perhaps later for downstate Illinois - could be more difficult in the months ahead. \Robert Alvarez, an Energy Department official in the Clinton administration, predicted that ""very large and very expensive programs are going to be even harder to pull off"" without large-scale support from taxpayers.\""There's going to be a much more intense competition for federal subsidies than ever before,"" said Alvarez, now a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies, a think tank in Washington.\NUCLEAR QUESTIONS\The cornerstone of McCain's energy planning is 45 nuclear reactors, which likely would cost in excess of $300 billion.\Obama has agreed that nuclear power must be part of the nation's future but also cited the nation's failure to settle on a solution for storing nuclear waste.\Even before the nation's current economic travails, the cost of nuclear plants put the feasibility of McCain's plan in question.\More than a year ago, six of the nation's top investment banks told Congress that financial risks and higher construction costs ""will make lenders unwilling at present to extend long-term credit."" \Since then, investment banking has been radically restructured and credit worries have mounted, meaning that utilities and holding companies building nuclear plants must rely even more heavily on government loan guarantees.\But so far, Congress has agreed to allocate just $18.5 billion to nuclear plants, nowhere near what it would take to build even a handful of new reactors.\To date, 17 entities, including AmerenUE in Missouri, have submitted applications to build a total of 25 new reactors. The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expecting five more applications over the next 14 months, a spokesman said this week.\Steve Kerekes, a spokesman for the industry's Nuclear Energy Institute, said companies anticipate a vastly changed credit market when they get to the point of putting together their financing in two or three years.\""Knock on wood for all of us, this situation will have sorted itself out for all of us by then or we're going to have bigger problems than whether nuclear plants get built,"" he said.\BATTLING DEPENDENCE\When debate moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS asked candidates last week how long it would take the United States to reduce dependency on foreign oil, Americans heard some distinctly rosy assessments. \Ten years, Obama said.\McCain went further: ""I think we can easily, within seven, eight, 10 years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security""?""?...""?,"" he responded.\Realistic or not, their responses were in keeping with voter sentiments. A poll released last week by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs produced these findings: 80 percent of Americans think securing adequate energy supplies should be a very important goal of U.S. foreign policy - more than 10 points higher than the goal of combating international terrorism.\The candidates disagree on drilling for oil and gas. Last spring, McCain dropped his opposition to drilling in the ocean for oil and gas. \Obama called McCain's reversal a ""gimmick"" and said he would continue to support a congressional freeze on drilling on most of the outer continental shelf, from 3 miles to 200 miles away from land.\But Obama, aware of public support for expanded drilling, later reversed course himself and said would accept offshore drilling if accompanied by more federal support for renewable energy sources.\The means to achieve energy independence remains in doubt. McCain has proposed a $300 million prize for a highly efficient electric car battery. Obama wants to offer $7,000 in tax credits for people who buy plug-in hybrids - vehicles that alternate between traditional engines and electric power with rechargeable batteries.\But plug-in hybrids are not yet sold and may not be widely available in the United States for several years.\Energy experts say candidates have focused too heavily on quick fixes rather than stressing what Americans can do now - energy conservation.\In candidate debates, McCain has not talked about energy conservation, and Obama has brought up the issue sparingly, advising people to weatherize their homes and businesses.\Michael Lubell is a physics professor at City College of New York and director of public affairs for the American Physical Society, the world's largest association of physicists. His organization published a report recently calling efficiency in fuel use and building design ""a great hidden energy resource.""\McCain, he said, ""has gotten caught in this trap of drilling our way out of something, which doesn't make sense.""\Obama? He has no clear record with regard to energy efficiency and has fallen prey to ""hype about plug-in hybrids, which is not realistic,"" Lubell added.\But Lubell praised both candidates for aggressive stands to combat climate change.\""Scientifcally, it is a compelling problem, and the public accepts the notion that it's a problem,"" Lubell said. ""But at the moment most people are feeling affected by other things in a much more urgent fashion.""\---\McCAIN V. OBAMA\ON ENERGY\THE TOP ISSUES \This is the third in a series of five stories running this week that will focus on top issues in the presidential race.\---\OBAMA WOULD:\Give $4 billion in loans and tax credits to the U.S. auto industry to retool plants to turn out plug-in hybrid vehicles.\Expand offshore drilling if paired with support for renewable energy sources.\Tap the countrys emergency oil stockpile to relieve pump prices.\Give families $1,000 energy rebate checks.\Allow the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to rein in unscrupulous speculators in oil futures.\Impose a windfall profi ts tax on the oil industry.\Invest $150 billion by 2018 in next-generation ethanol, cleaner-coal production.\Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels with a cap-and-trade system that puts a price on pollution and gives plants fl exibility to meet emission limits.\---\McCAIN WOULD:\Build 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030.\Expand oil and gas drilling in the ocean.\Temporarily suspend the federal tax on gasoline and diesel.\Award a $300 million prize for developing a battery package that would advance commercial availability for plug-in hybrids or electric cars.\Spend $2 billion a year on research to reduce coal-burning pollution.\Allow a $5,000 tax credit for purchase of zero-emission cars, with lesser credits for new autos emitting lower carbon emissions.\Replace temporary tax credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy sources with permanent credits.\Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent below 1990 levels under cap-andtrade.\Credit: Bill Lambrecht; Post-Dispatch Washington Bureau Chief"
102,"Tom Carnahan, son of the late Gov. Mel Carnahan and former Sen. Jean Carnahan, could be called a green visionary and entrepreneur. The company he founded converts the prevailing winds of northwest Missouri into dollars with minimal impact on the environment. The little town of Rock Port is served by four wind turbines and is independent of the local power grid. Excess electricity is sold to a local electric cooperative. We spoke in Carnahan's corner office on the mostly empty second floor in a rehabbed brick building on Washington Avenue downtown.\This is an impressive office for a start-up company.\I started this in 2005. I wanted to see if I could be the developer of Missouri's first wind project. We pulled the partners together. We got the community and the landowners; and the rural electric co-ops came on board. We got bipartisan support from legislators in the area.\This was your idea?\It was solely my idea. I quit practicing law and was very excited about renewable energy. It didn't make any sense that there were wind farms in Iowa and Kansas and Oklahoma and Illinois and none in Missouri. So I went about trying to figure how to get that done. Everyone was cooperative. The farmers were a little skeptical at first, and I had to ask them to take a leap of faith with me because it had never been done in Missouri before. If I could pull this together, I needed them to tell me I could use their property.\Did your family name help?\I think it did. I don't think they did it because of my family name, but they knew where to find me.\What is your total megawatts?We have, in Missouri, right at 160 megawatts. Our first project was 57 megawatts. The next two were 50, and the Rock Port one was five.\Are other companies getting into this?We have competitors. Luckily, our company was profitable from the first year because we were able to rapidly get projects done. I was able to get profits and put them back into the company to hire new people.\About a year ago, it became clear that if we were going to be a top-tier wind developer, we were going to need a larger balance sheet. I went looking for the right partner. In April, we closed a $150 million equity investment in Wind Capital Group. It's a Dublin-based company. \Isn't $150 million pretty small?\It's all relative. That's enough for us to grow over the next couple of years and purchase the equipment we need to do these projects. Wind turbines are a couple million dollars apiece. That doesn't include construction costs.\Is your company privately held?\That's correct. As we look where we're going to be two to three years from now, we're constantly running different scenarios. We'll look at public markets from time to time.\Where are the turbines made?\We have Suzlon (Wind Energy) turbines. They build the turbines in India, and now they're building the blades in Minnesota.\We've bought 150 megawatts of GE turbines to be delivered in 2010. They are all made in the United States. I want to see much of the wind energy (industry) based in the U.S., if possible.Isn't a wind turbine a simple piece of equipment? Will these stimulate a green economy?\Wind turbines are more complicated than you may expect. The blades are like a very finely designed airplane wing. There are computerized equipment, gearboxes, the generator inside. On the outside, with the monopole, they look very simple.\Are you limited to what you can do in Missouri to the northwestern part because strong winds aren't found elsewhere?\The good winds are almost completely concentrated in northwest Missouri. We wouldn't have been able to build a wind farm where we have with the technology that existed 10 years ago. Turbines are getting more efficient, and the blades are getting longer, so places that were marginal a few years ago all of a sudden make sense now.\Can you imagine wind farms across the northern tier of counties?Absolutely. It's not just where you can get wind. You could have the best wind regimes on earth, but if you don't have any transmission lines, if you can't move the electricity from the windy spots to the demand centers in urban areas, you're not going to have wind farms there. One good thing about northwest Missouri is there is a lot of transmission, so it's unique.Do you plan to go into other renewables?It's something I've grappled with. Are we a wind-energy company, or are we a renewable-energy company? I decided we are a wind-energy company, and that we were going to do that better than anyone. We are going to focus on developing wind-energy projects with an emphasis on the midwestern U.S.\Are there risks with cultural and political differences?\I actually relish that. Challenges in business and in life, for that matter, present opportunities. So if there's a challenge in doing a job in Brazil, that might just mean an opportunity for us if our competitors don't want to go there.\All the developers in 2005 said you couldn't do a project in the state of Missouri. It was common knowledge that wind energy wouldn't work here. In that challenge, I found an opportunity and was able to start a business.\Can you saturate the market geographically?\I don't think that's going to happen any time soon. The midwestern U.S. is a very, very big area. The immediate challenge is saturating the transmission capacity that's available. That's happening right now. There are not enough power lines to move energy safely and effectively.\What do you pay landowners?\About $5,000 per turbine per year. We have some farmers that have five or six of them on their property. It's not taking any land out of production, so they like it.\In addition, we believe in paying our fair share of property taxes. That is good business. The community as a whole sees the benefit, not just the farmers involved. \You're not looking to dodge taxes?\No. It's difficult. As prices go up, there's a lot of pressure to cut costs. We need to do that to have competitively priced electricity. We made a decision that we are not going to seek tax abatements like some of our competitors have.\What does it cost to produce a megawatt of electricity?\I can't talk about specific projects and our power-sales agreements. We would be very competitive with energy made from natural gas right now. The important thing to remember is wind energy is inflation-proof. Once the project is built, you know what the price is going to be for 20 years.\This is a very important point. You don't have fuel-price fluctuations. You don't have to wonder what the railroad's going to charge you to move your fuel.\Even if wind is slightly higher in 2008 than its competitors, you look at the price over time. It's a flat price over 20 years, compared to a combined-cycle or a coal unit that's going to have increased costs. Even if you sprinkle in a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, it all of a sudden looks very, very good.\---\Tom CARNAHAN\Position: President and CEO, Wind Capital Group\Age: 39\Career: Staff attorney, St. Louis city counselor's office, 1995-1997; partner, Carnahan & Garvin, 1997-2005; founded Wind Capital Group, 2005\Education: Bachelor of arts, international relations, William Jewell College, 1991; juris doctor, University of Missouri at Columbia, 1995\Personal: Lives in the Central West End with his wife, Lisa; two daughters"

Keene said. ""Will they go out and do that for him? I think that more of them would today than when he locked up the nomination. But there is still a lot of room for improvement."" \Apart from the party\Nonetheless, McCain's distance from party orthodoxy in recent years may be what kept his candidacy afloat in a time of sagging GOP fortunes. Indeed, polls show McCain running far better than Republicans in general in an election in which a bad economy and so-called Bush fatigue suggests a banner Democratic year.\When pollsters for six major surveys asked voters in August which political party they intended to vote for in congressional elections in November, Democrats came out on top by margins ranging from 7 to 18 percent.\But McCain, after a strong month of campaigning, has drawn all but even in his contest with Obama, polls show.\Former Missouri Sen. John Danforth will be a delegate for McCain, the first time he has attended a GOP convention as a delegate since 1984. Danforth thinks he understands why the Republican Party is out of favor with voters: A struggling economy, high gas prices, and weariness of war add up to a general desire for change.\But Danforth said he believes that disenchantment will abate ""when it gets down to one-on-one combat between Obama and McCain and the question of which one they want in the White House. My hope is that the convention will be more than just hoopla and that it will be able to further clarify the differences."" \That's what Republicans will seek to do starting Monday night with speeches by President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney that likely will seek to burnish McCain's leadership image, an advantage already that has helped him draw even in polls.\On Tuesday, Rudy Giuliani's keynote speech recalling the specter of 9/11 is part of the GOP effort this week to highlight ongoing dangers in the world, stressing the ability of McCain, a former POW, to combat terrorism.\Then on Wednesday, the nation will have an opportunity to hear Palin in a performance that could help McCain significantly in swing states, strategists say.\The need for reunification is especially great in Missouri, where McCain was drubbed in the primary by Mike Huckabee, particularly in the southwestern part of the state.\GOP strategist John Hancock, who headed Missouri's Republican Party, said that Palin ""truly establishes this ticket as a reform ticket, and probably does so better than any other potential vice presidential candidate he could have picked. I am as certain as I have ever been that the Republican base is going to turn out for this ticket.""\The Rev. Harold Hendrick, a Christian broadcasting talk show host in St. Louis on the Bott Radio Network, called Palin ""very similar to Huckabee. I think conservatives are wonderfully invigorated in these first few hours, according to what I'm sensing and hearing.""\An iPhone moment?\Young Republicans also hope that McCain and the Republicans devote energy to winning over younger voters, where Obama holds a decided edge.\David All, 29, a GOP consultant on hand for the convention, noted that he was a 9-year-old practicing kick-flips on his skateboard in Reagan's last year in office. ""The party needs to turn around this narrative about how the youths don't care about the Republican Party,"" he said.\How? Perhaps, said All, by doing a better job this week of communicating with young voters via the Internet. ""Maybe McCain should pull out an iPhone during his speech and make a joke about it,"" All said.\Jim Durbin, 35, of Chesterfield, is a media consultant who operates 24thstate.com, a political blog. He's also a disenchanted conservative waiting to be won over by more emphasis on limiting government regulation and taxes. ""I would love to be a Republican, but they don't speak to me,"" he said.\Republicans in St. Paul will be aiming barbs at Obama, but Durbin believes the party could go overboard. ""I don't want a campaign focused entirely on Obama. That would be a train-wreck and I think they would lose if they do that ... I would love to see McCain focus on what is great about this country.""\---\Our Coverage Plans\A team of Post-Dispatch reporters at the national political conventions will file video and blog reports as well as stories for the newspaper.\The online reporting will allow viewers of the newspaper's website, STLtoday.com, to see and hear interviews with delegates from the Missouri and Illinois area and read convention news as it happens. \The website's convention report will feature the Political Fix blog and feeds from the newspaper staffers to Twitter, a microblogging site that features short text updates.

WASHINGTON - When Democrats rolled out their ""Green New Deal"" resolutions in Congress, 38 of the 68 initial House sponsors were from three states: California, New York and Massachusetts. Only 18 were from noncoastal states.\Nine of 11 initial Democratic co-sponsors in the Senate were from coastal states. The other two -- Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- are running in a crowded Democratic presidential primary where the expansive, socialistic provisions in the measure appeal to liberal voters.\Such a coast vs. interior contrast that was so evident in President Donald Trump's election in 2016 is central to understanding the paralyzing polarization on climate change.\Republicans, strongest in the center of the country, defend fossil fuel as crucial to the nation's economic and national security. But that stance invites criticism that they're indifferent to science showing human activity contributes to rising greenhouse gas levels.\The Democrats' Green New Deal -- a broadly written wish list advocating for transformational changes in the economy and society -- has rekindled claims that the Democrats are again walking leftward off the deep end.\A study by a group affiliated with a former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the plan, with guaranteed income and health care for everyone and expensive proposals to retrofit buildings to improve energy efficiency, could cost the U.S. a staggering $93 trillion.\Twenty years ago, Republicans and Democrats were not that far apart in agreeing that global warming deserved cohesive national action.\Democrats were calling for more regulation but also backing ""cap and trade"" policies of Republican President George Bush.\Republicans, urging market-based environmental incentives, nominated climate change hawk John McCain for president in 2008. The party's platform that year said ""human economic activity"" had increased carbon emissions, and it declared that ""common sense dictates that the United States should take measured and reasonable steps today to reduce any impact on the environment.""\Eleven years later, while Democrats have moved toward socialist solutions, the GOP caucuses in Congress are sprinkled with climate change skeptics. Trump says he doesn't believe the dire national security warnings of the climate assessment issued by his own government, and he's forming his own climate advisory committee to challenge it.\Looking to the 2020 elections, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell will soon force a vote on the Democrats' Green New Deal to draw a sharp line between Trump and the half dozen senators seeking the Democratic nomination.\""We'll give everybody an opportunity to go on record and see how they feel about the Green New Deal,"" McConnell said.\WHAT HAPPENED?\In the 1990s, Newt Gingrich-led Republicans were sharpening ideological differences with Democrats, and Republicans began arguing that the U.S. should do nothing to hurt the country's competition with other big polluting nations.\Democratic President Bill Clinton, under impeachment siege, was unable to get the Senate to agree to the U.S. entering the greenhouse-gas-limiting Kyoto climate accords.\After Democrat Barack Obama beat McCain in 2008, the rising Tea Party threatened Republican officeholders with primary challenges, and it defeated leading GOP climate change hawks like South Carolina's Rep. Bob Inglis.\Today, ""environmental protection and especially climate change is a big part of political polarization in the United States,"" said Dave Robertson, political science chair at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.\Coastal residents, who are exposed to the threat of rising seas, are more likely than Middle America residents to blame human activity for rising temperatures and to be more amenable to significant government action to combat it.\In terms of its views on climate change, St. Louis is more akin to Seattle than Springfield, Mo., according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, an intensive study of county-level public opinion on the issue.\Its 2018 survey concluded that 78 percent of the residents of St. Louis, and 75 percent of those living in St. Louis County, agreed that ""global warming is happening."" Seattle and Washington, D.C., also came in at 78 percent, while in Greene County, where Springfield is the county seat, 67 percent agreed. Many rural Missouri counties were in the low 50s.\Statewide, Missouri was 5 points below the 70 percent national average of those who believe global warming to be real -- 11 points below California and 12 below New York.\In the suburban district of Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, 72 percent agreed that global warming is real. Next door, in the more rural district represented by Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-St. Elizabeth, Mo., it was 61 percent.\Geography and differing philosophies on the role of government have shaped American politics since before the Declaration of Independence. The differences intensify when the problems go more global.\Days after the Green New Deal was introduced, Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-University City, announced he was going to support it because it includes language about seeking social and economic justice.\Clay released a photo showing him with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who had campaigned last year for Clay's Democratic primary opponent, Cori Bush. Then, Ocasio-Cortez charged that Clay was among Democrats who had not been bold enough in tackling problems like this.\Ocasio-Cortez is the prime sponsor of the House resolution, and she's become a lightning rod for opponents, who seized on her statements and related climate change documents issued by her office (erroneously, a staffer said) that proposed everything from restricting air travel to cracking down on flatulating cows, while taxing 70 percent of income over $10 million.\Critics said it was socialism that would cripple the U.S. economy. Her allies say we're heading there, anyway, unless climate change is immediately addressed.\Even as he signed onto the Green New Deal, Clay warned fellow Democrats not to go too far left because of the political damage he says it could do to Democrats who won close elections in swing congressional districts to give their party control of the House.\""So hopefully we come to our senses as a party and realize there is enough room for all sides and not just one dogma, one ideology, that pushes you so far left that you become a minority,"" he said.\Republicans have portrayed Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal as a threat to the fossil fuels, manufacturing and agricultural industries that power the interior.\Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who says he believes climate change is real and that humans are contributing, also says that the Green New Deal would drastically shift economic and political power further from people who manufacture goods and grow food to Silicon Valley and Wall Street, which he said already disproportionately benefit from concentrations of technology and finance.\Hawley said the better solution would be to push market-based ideas in industries like biofuels, which would help agriculture.\""The Green New Deal strikes me as the biggest crony insider deal of all time,"" Hawley said. ""It is a massive wealth transfer from the Midwest to the coasts, and from working families to rich ones. ... It would devastate farms in Missouri. It would devastate manufacturing in Missouri.""\'SIX AMERICAS'\The Yale study describes ""six Americas"" on climate change: ""Alarmed,"" ""concerned,"" ""cautious,"" ""disengaged,"" ""doubtful"" and ""dismissive.""\The National Climate Assessment issued by Trump's administration last year landed on the first two, concluding that ""climate change creates new risks and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities in communities across the United States, presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life and the rate of economic growth."" But Trump said ""I don't believe"" the federally mandated report, which was put together by scientists in conjunction with federal agencies led by his own appointees.\Some Republicans, like Hawley, Wagner and Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., are in the ""cautious"" category, acknowledging human activity but resisting the transformational economic and social changes advocated in the Democrats' Green New Deal.\""I am not a climate change denier,"" Wagner said. ""There are things that we should be doing, but in the private sector.\""What we have to be careful about is the tradeoffs have to be balanced,"" she said. ""We cannot disadvantage our own economy and business development.""\She said energy giant Ameren's Renewable Choice Program giving consumers renewable energy source options was a good action blueprint. Roughly 80 percent of Missouri's energy now comes from coal.\Climate change deniers in her party ""need to hear from some of their constituents,"" Wagner said.\""Let's face it,"" Wagner said, ""we are not going to do this unless countries globally decide to take care of our Earth.""\But that's what the Paris climate accords, which Trump withdrew the U.S. from, was ostensibly all about. Clay predicted Democrats will rely on science to eventually get the U.S. back into that accord.\But Clay also acknowledged that the Green New Deal, with its potentially massive price tag and calls for total dependency on renewable energy, leaves it vulnerable to attacks from those who say Democrats are pushing these massive changes just as America has finally become energy independent through the development of fossil fuels.\""Some of that (criticism) is valid,"" Clay said. But the Green New Deal ""moves the ball down the field as far as being able to start talking about specific legislation and really addressing climate.""\CREDIT: By Chuck Raasch, St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
105,"Speech shows it's time for a new conversation about schools\The uproar over President Barack Obama's speech to encourage students to work hard and stay in school was unfortunate, but it provides us with a ""teachable moment.""\After nearly two generations of blaming schools for the problems in American life, it finally has become counterproductive. The practice alienates citizens from their schools. It puts a barrier between educators and the public they serve. It encourages badly informed, often vituperative, government-bashing. And it distracts us in the effort to improve schools. It is destructive and has outlived its usefulness. A colleague retiring this year said recently in private that she had spent every day of her working career under a cloud of public criticism. Had she understood what lay ahead, she said, she was not sure she would ever have entered a classroom. A teacher writing in the Washington Post in August said something similar. Early this month, Minneapolis school board member Christ Stuart described a ""feeding frenzy of negativity"" around schools that has undermined educators' confidence ""because of the relentless criticism."" I don't believe educators are above criticism, but to be effective, criticism has to be constructive. The point is not that educators or the profession are above criticism. It is that unrelenting and undifferentiated criticism has become destructive of the goals that all citizens and especially parents hold in common for the public schools. It is time for a new conversation, one that explores assets, hopes and possibilities instead of liabilities, fears and complaints. Critics should be just as eager to tell us what they like about their schools as they are to tell us what they dislike. A respectful conversation like that can encourage educators to summon the collective will to tackle the serious educational challenges our society faces. We are not going to fix these problems by pointing fingers at each other. It's going to take all of us working together. Our society has been ignoring deep-rooted problems while blaming them on schools for much too long, with, if we are to be honest, very little to show for the effort. Meanwhile, average achievement in our schools today is little better than it was in 1983 when ""A Nation at Risk"" appeared, while the achievement gap is narrowing barely, if at all. Yet we have many positive stories to tell about school successes. It is time we shine a light on them. Robert H. Koff - St. Louis\Seldom heard above the noise: The majority\I am a 65-year-old retired school teacher. I'm not rich, and I'm not poor. I'm not a Democrat, and I'm not a Republican. I've always voted. I have not missed voting in an election since I was old enough to vote. I am, in short, part of that elusive ""silent majority"" that elected Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Barack Obama in 2008. I am a part of that silent majority that fights our wars, pays our taxes and works to help America prosper as we strive to make good lives for our families. Over the years, I have voted Republican when I felt that the candidate represented the best chance for America and Democratic when I felt that candidate was the best alternative.\Those of us who make up this large and vital contingent in America are not really silent. We seldom are heard above the noise of the extremists on either end of the political spectrum. We spend more time listening than talking and very little time screaming to shout down people with whom we disagree. Like most Americans, we cherish our country and, especially, our brand of democracy that has evolved over the history of our country. That democracy has survived for more than 230 years because we always have accepted the verdict of the electorate, even if we didn't vote for the winning candidate, except for the election of Abraham Lincoln election in 1860. In 2008, we voted for change. Now we find that the losing side has adopted a loud, disrespectful and mean-spirited agenda that clearly is designed to defeat change and to cripple this president. It is their right to do so, as Americans. But let me remind them that behavior such as we have seen in these past few months from the conservative right does nothing but polarize the country. Do they really want to force those of us in the middle to make a choice to move right or left? If so, I must warn them that they may not like the direction of that movement.\John Blalock - Pacific\Questions to ask\As a retired health information professional, I experienced the high premium monopoly of private health insurance companies. After COBRA, at age 62, the best individual health insurance available to me cost $735 per month for the first year and $785 per month for the second year. I had no history of cancer, heart disease, diabetes or high blood pressure. I definitely favor health insurance reform to benefit all Americans.\Those who are demonstrating against reform - those with and without health insurance - should be asking questions.\Ask the politicians how much money has the insurance or health care industry lobbyists contributed to their campaign and political action committees last year, this year and to date? U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Springfield, Mo., in three years received $183,550 in health care industry contributions, according to the consumerwatchdog.org. Have his family members, some of whom are lobbyists, ever been lobbyists for health insurance or pharmaceutical industries?\Thousands of workers lose high-paying jobs every month because of the crumbling economy. Those people can't afford insurance. The protesters should realize they, a relative or a friend probably will be one of these people soon.\How much health care and insurance money is spent on advertising the talk shows whose hosts tell people to rally against health insurance reform? How much are those hosts paid to keep a segment of the voters uninformed or misinformed?\Americans need a public option to be able to obtain the best health care benefits for their families, from minimum-wage workers to the highest-paid workers.\We need competition for current monopolizing health insurance industry in order to have lower premiums and insurance for everyone.\L.L.H. Ray - Ferguson\The upside of global warming\Regarding ""Why we can't wait"" (Sept. 13): There is no doubt that the climate has warmed over the last 150 years and little doubt that this, at least partly, is the result of emission of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels. Unfortunately, that is as far as the understanding of climate will take us. We do not understand the science well enough to predict how much the climate will continue to warm or what its consequences will be. The predictions of the best computer models disagree by a factor of more than two; most of them, perhaps all, must be wrong, but we don't know which ones.\There have been storms, droughts and rises and falls of sea level at least as long as there have been people to observe and record them.\There is no evidence that these will become more severe or more frequent as the climate warms. Over the last century, as the climate has warmed, the frequency of North Atlantic hurricanes has been roughly constant, possibly decreasing slowly.\For good physics reasons, global warming is concentrated in the coldest regions and, in temperate climates, in winter. Neither the tropics nor temperate (St. Louis) summers get hotter. Global warming lengthens growing seasons in temperate and sub-arctic climates. A similar warm period, the Late Medieval Climatic Maximum, was a time of human expansion and prosperity in northern Europe. Greenland was green, and it is greening again.\As India, China and other poorer countries become more prosperous. The rate of carbon emissions steadily will increase. People won't freeze in the dark for the sake of a scientific theory, even a correct scientific theory.\Rather than bemoan climate change that probably is inevitable, we should plan on adapting to and taking advantage of it. Longer growing seasons and increased carbon dioxide ""fertilization"" of plants will almost certainly be good for humanity.\Jonathan Katz - Clayton\Vain proclamation\The commentary ""Why we can't wait"" (Sept. 13) by Peter Raven, president of the Missouri Botanical Garden, makes some outrageous claims about global warming. How can Mr. Raven be so certain? If you were planning for a camping trip in three weeks, do you think Mr. Raven could provide you today with a foolproof weather forecast? Probably not. Not even the best meteorologists would make that call.\Perhaps Mr. Raven is unfamiliar with the four ice age periods the Earth has gone through since it began spinning. There was a whole lot of global warming and cooling going on back then, and none of it was man-made.\As recently as the 1970s, major news outlets were reporting on urgency of global cooling. (Consider ""Another Ice Age?"" in the June 24, 1974, Time magazine.) Those predictions were wrong, and retractions were written.\The Earth constantly is being heated and cooled by factors beyond mankind's control. Among the most influential is from sun spots (solar flares) that appear in 11-year cycles and that have been well documented by scientists for more than 400 years. What about the millions of volcanic eruptions that have spewed immeasurable debris and pollution into the Earth's atmosphere over the course of time? Global warming alarmists like Mr. Raven ignore obvious facts like these to further a political agenda rather than a scientific one.\It is incredibly vain for scientists like Mr. Raven to suggest mankind could change the temperature of the Earth, even if we wanted to.\Michael Van Wallis - Ballwin\Controvertible science\The commentary ""Why we can't wait"" (Sept. 13) must be refuted. I find it hard to believe anyone with a hint of scientific preparation would dare to declare that his evidence was incontrovertible. To claim that the evidence shows that global climate change is man-made is imminently controvertible. Global warming as a fact is seriously in doubt. Contrary to what Mr. Raven states, measurements show that 10 of the last 12 years have shown a cooling trend. According to the National Weather Service, the oceans are cooling, the Pacific in particular, and extreme dry conditions on the West Coast are a direct result.\The notion that carbon dioxide is contributing to climate change may have started as a scheme by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to break a coal miners strike. There was no evidence then, nor is there now, that carbon dioxide is detrimental to the environment. Carbon dioxide is as necessary as oxygen. Ice core studies show that in past warming and cooling cycles, the increase in temperature preceded the rise in carbon dioxide. The significantly higher global temperatures experienced during the medieval period were not caused by carbon dioxide and the quite lower temperatures of the 1700s did not result from a lowering of carbon dioxide. The Earth warms and cools primarily as a result of activity on the sun. We are entering a period of reduced sun spot activity. A good bet would be that we will experience a continuing lower global temperature.\We can't afford the wasted financial resources, the massive unemployment and the setback in the nation's recovery that will be the cost of proposals such as the cap-and-trade bill.\Clyde Bollinger - Festus"
106,"News-Leader\Carbon dioxide puts the fizz in your soda pop and snuffs flames when squirted from fire extinguishers.\But on an industrial scale, carbon dioxide is blamed for trapping heat in the atmosphere and making global warming worse.\Coal-fired power plants emit a lot of carbon dioxide, a fact that City Utilities officials hope to address through a one-of-a-kind test project at CU's coal-burning Southwest Power Station.\With the help of four research partners, CU seeks to find out if it's safe and feasible to inject large amounts of carbon dioxide from its power plant chimneys into saltwater-filled rock formations some 2,000 feet below the surface. The greenhouse gas today goes straight into the atmosphere.\If the test succeeds, CU may be able to reduce its emissions and limit the impact of a future ""carbon tax"" that nearly all environmental watchers predict Congress will enact within five years. It may also pave the way for other utilities.\""We see carbon regulations coming, and we want to get ahead of the game,"" said Gary Pendergrass, CU's manager of environmental compliance. ""We think this pilot project has a lot of merit.""\So does Missouri Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mexico.\Bond recently secured $2.5 million in the Senate's Energy and Water spending bill to help pay for the project. It still needs final approval by Congress.\CU will need to ante up $500,000 in matching funds.\The project is a collaborative effort between City Utilities, Missouri State University, University of Missouri-Rolla, Washington University in St. Louis and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.\Bruce Nilles, a Wisconsin-based Sierra Club attorney who has battled CU over air permit issues, said the utility should have found a way to deal with carbon dioxide before it broke ground on a new power plant. Southwest 2 is expected to go online in 2010.\""While we enthusiastically support research to determine whether carbon capture and storage is technically and economically feasible, CU's failure to address this issue before moving forward to build an expensive new coal plant that will emit millions of tons of carbon dioxide annually presents an extraordinary risk for CU's customers,"" Nilles said in an email response.\""CU could help to mitigate this risk by putting its new coal plant on hold until it has a viable plan to reduce its global warming emissions.""\Scientific approach\The test project is a science mission in search of answers, Pendergrass said.\""There's a lot of testing and modeling to do before we get to the injection phase,"" he said. ""It will take a year to do the test bore holes, another year for research and analysis at the universities. I think it will be 2 or 2-1/2 years before we have a final report.\""If the answers are 'no' at any point along the way, we simply stop the project.""\Currently there is no low-cost way to extract carbon dioxide out of chimney gases from a pulverized-coal plant like the ones CU operates, although an Illinois power plant is researching that kind of technology.\For its test project, CU will purchase pure carbon dioxide.\Before CU even attempts to inject the gas into an existing well at Southwest, the utility's research partners will analyze the geology below the plant.\Researchers will take core samples of rock to see how porous it is, how easily water and gas move through it and what makes up the various layers of stone.\They'll calculate the strength of the rock layers and how much carbon dioxide pressure would be needed to crack the layers.\Some of the research will focus on how carbon dioxide will behave once it's injected.\Pendergrass said the theory is that some of it will dissolve into the saltwater. Some of it would be physically trapped by the rock barriers.\And under high pressures and cold temperatures at that 2,000-foot depth some of the carbon dioxide might turn into solid crystals.\""We think all three will occur there. That's what we have to find out.""\Will gas stay down?\Perhaps most importantly, researchers will try to determine how far carbon dioxide gas pumped under high pressure will travel and whether it will stay underground.\""We gotta do the science and let the facts come to light first,"" said Pete Mulvany, chief geologist with the state Division of Geology and Land Survey.\""We do not know for certain if there's a geologic seal down there that would prevent carbon dioxide from migrating to the surface.""\Undetected cracks in the layers of rock could let the gas escape and defeat the effort to permanently lock it away from the atmosphere. Because carbon dioxide is heavier than air, a sudden venting of stored gas could also threaten human life nearby.\The venting has happened naturally near some volcanoes. In 1986, a massive carbon dioxide gas bubble belched out of a volcanic lake in Cameroon, Africa, sinking to the ground and killing 1,700 people.\There are no volcanoes near Springfield but there are thousands of wells drilled to various depths. At least three wells in Greene County are deep enough to intersect the strata where CU hopes to eventually sequester its power plant carbon dioxide.\Mulvany said the state has a ""fairly good"" record of wells - water, oil and gas, and exploratory - drilled over the years. It's important to know their location because a well that comes close to or penetrates the area where carbon dioxide would be injected and stored could serve as a conduit for the gas to escape and reach the surface.\CU plans to inject carbon dioxide into a layer of saltwater-saturated rock about 330 feet thick and 1,800 feet deep.\A 245-foot layer of denser stone lays atop of that water-filled rock, and CU believes it may be dense enough to keep the gas from moving up through it. The project isn't far enough along to know whether the ""confining layer"" of rock actually will keep the gas from moving upward.\Mulvany said the quality of water in that lower layer of rock also will be analyzed.\Scientists know it has a certain level of saltiness, but Mulvany said if the dissolved solids are below a certain level it could be declared an underground source of drinking water.\""If so there would have to be an exception issued by the EPA for CU to inject down there,"" he said.\Norway plant\Currently there is only one fully operational carbon sequestration project in the world that captures carbon dioxide emissions and deposits them into a saline aquifer.\The Sleipher Platform, located 140 miles off the coast of Norway, extracts carbon dioxide out of natural gas and injects it more than 3,000 feet below the North Sea. The storage formation is under 2,000 feet of shale and removed from drinking water sources.\Two other carbon sequestration projects in Weyburn, Canada, and In Salah, Algeria, use high-pressure carbon dioxide to force oil and gas closer to the surface.\Other experimental injections have taken place in Texas' deep saline aquifers and shallower West Virginia coal seams.\However CU's carbon sequestration effort would be the first of its kind for a saline aquifer at such a shallow depth.\CU is looking to store carbon dioxide at relatively shallow levels since Missouri has no suitable deeper storage areas.\There are ""deep basin"" sites in West Central Plains states where carbon dioxide can be injected at depths of 2 to 4 miles or more, he said.\Energy experts envision a network of pipelines criss-crossing states that would transfer carbon dioxide from power plants and other industrial producers to the deep injection sites.\Pendergrass said that would be a very costly option for CU and its customers. Bond's office estimated CU's pipeline costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\Process has costs\Instead, CU is hoping it can successfully store carbon dioxide locally.\Though it may be less costly than building a carbon dioxide pipeline, sequestering the gas underground isn't without cost.\A Massachusetts Institute of Technology report ""The Future of Coal"" concludes underground carbon dioxide storage is scientifically feasible but likely would raise costs for utility customers.\Why? The injection technology carries high costs.\Still, a utility could recoup some of those costs because the government is likely to start taxing carbon emissions.\""It's pretty clear that coming down the pipe, there's going to be a tax on carbon emissions,"" said Howard Herzog, the principal research engineer at MIT's Laboratory for Energy and the Environment.\No one can yet say how that tax might be structured. Some see a system where companies that successfully sequester carbon dioxide could sell ""credits"" to those that have no way to do so, similar to air pollution ""cap and trade"" systems already allowed by the EPA.\However the price of electricity is likely to increase for ratepayers regardless of the success of CU's experiment, though perhaps not as much as if CU had to pipeline the gas elsewhere.\Even if CU limits its liability by the time a carbon emission tax goes into effect, the process of capturing and storing the gas requires a large capital expense to retrofit existing power plants with new technology.\Electricity needed to capture and compress carbon dioxide can also reduce a power plant's energy output, depending on the technology and the type of coal that's used, according to the MIT study.\To generate the extra energy to capture and sequester carbon dioxide, a power plant would have to buy and burn more coal and those costs likely would be passed on.\Other utilities no doubt will be watching the outcome of CU's pilot project.\""If we can show it can be done safely and successfully in shallow depths, others might be able to do the same,"" Pendergrass said.\News-Leader graphic artist Pete Smith contributed to this story.\On Page 3A\Regulatory hurdles: Before proceeding with a carbon dioxide storage plan, CU would have to apply for a state permit and follow EPA rules.\News-Leader.com\Documents: View reports from City Utilities and the EPA on carbon dioxide sequestration.\Graphic:\How the sequestration project would eventually work\Once a feasibility study is completed, City Utilities workers would bring in a variable amount of food-grade carbon dioxide gas and pump it underground using an injection well.\Monitoring measures\City Utilities maintains three groundwater wells at the Sourhwest Power ;oant site to draw water from the Oark aquifer for cooling purposes. Shuld any CO2 escape from confinement in the St. Francois aquifer, City Utilites estimates it would dissoulve in the fresh water and be detected by the wells that affect the flow of groundwater in the area.\The storage destination\The CO2 would be released at approximately 1800 feet underground in a gaseous state at the beginning of the St. Francois aquifer. There it would begin to displace the natural saline water in the remainder of the bore hole and gradually move upwards and outwards through the pores of the Lamotte sandstone.\Chemical interactions\Some CO2 would dissolve into the saline water.

107,"SEATTLE * Washington lawmakers have tried and failed in recent years to make polluters pay for their carbon emissions to fight climate change. Now, voters will get to decide.\An initiative on the November ballot asks voters whether the state should impose the nation's first direct carbon tax on the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline.\Sponsors say residents have a moral responsibility to curb greenhouse gas emissions, and a carbon tax is the best way to do it. The tax encourages businesses to conserve or switch to clean energy by making fossil fuels more expensive, and it makes the tax system fairer by using the revenue to reduce other taxes, they say.\Businesses say the tax will drive up fuel and energy costs and put Washington companies at a competitive disadvantage.\And in a move that has bewildered some, major environmental and other groups including those that backed Gov. Jay Inslee's proposal last year to cap emissions and make carbon polluters pay oppose the initiative. They say it takes the wrong approach.\Yoram Bauman, an economist who founded Carbon Washington, the grass-roots group that gathered more than 350,000 signatures to qualify Initiative 732, defended it as great climate and tax policy.\""It does almost everything right for Washington,"" he said.\Audubon Washington supports it.\""Our members came down on the side of urgency. We don't have time to wait,"" said Gail Gatton, the group's executive director. ""Climate change is happening, and this is our best available option right now to protect birds.""\But the Sierra Club, Washington Environmental Council and the advocacy group Front and Centered say the initiative is the wrong carbon-pricing approach and will hurt the state's revenues. Whereas Inslee's pollution fee would have raised money for education, transportation, clean energy and programs to help disadvantaged communities affected by climate change, Initiative 732 provides no such investments, critics say.\""It's not a path that makes sense for our communities,"" said Rich Stolz, executive director of OneAmerica, which works on social justice issues. Stolz said the initiative ignores climate justice and lacks input from communities of color.\Stolz's group is part of a coalition that worked on an alternative carbon-pricing measure. Last-minute talks between that coalition and I-732 supporters to collaborate on one ballot measure fizzled last year.\The initiative is designed to be revenue neutral, meaning the tax revenue increase from fossil fuels would be mostly offset by decreases in other taxes. In this case, revenues would be returned to people and businesses by cutting the state sales tax by one point, virtually eliminating business taxes for manufacturers and providing rebates for working families, sponsors say.\A state analysis, however, estimates the measure could cost the state about $800 million in lost revenues over the first six fiscal years. Initiative sponsors dispute the state's analysis, saying it double-counted the rebates in the first year.\The carbon tax is modeled after one in the nearby Canadian province of British Columbia. California has a cap-and-trade program, which limits emissions and allows carbon polluters to buy and trade pollution credits. If approved, Washington's carbon tax starts at $15 a ton of carbon emissions in July, goes up to $25 the next year and incrementally increases afterward.\The Washington State Tree Fruit Association, which represents growers, packers and marketers, is among those opposed.\It takes a lot of fuel to grow and transport produce, and the tax will be paid by those in the state, not competitors outside it, said Jon Devaney, the group's president.\""Raising food prices in Washington state will make us less competitive compared to others,"" he said.\Credit: PHUONG LE; Associated Press"

\
In spite of the wisecracks we all like to make about government, we know that if we didn't have one, we would eventually devolve to the hapless condition of a Bosnia or Somalia. We need government, and we have to pay for it. So we have to tax something.
\
But we don't have to tax things we want, such as income, profit or capital gains. Taxes on the proceeds of investment reduce the incentive to invest. Taxes on wages reduce the incentive to work. Why not reduce the incentive to produce something we don't want - such as pollution? The Clinton-Gore White House is going to be taking the idea of pollution taxes very seriously, especially a tax on carbon.
\
Why carbon? From a revenue-raising point of view, because there's so much carbon to tax. Oil, gas and coal flow through our economy in enormous quantities. Each $100 per ton assessed on the carbon in fossil fuels would, at present rates of use, bring in $120 billion a year, about one-tenth our current government budget. A carbon tax would be fairly easy to collect, because it could be levied at the point of production or import of each fuel - at coal mines, oil wells, gas wells and incoming tankers. That would be much simpler than collecting at every point of pollution emission - every tailpipe and smokestack in the nation.
\
From a pollution-reducing point of view, carbon should be taxed because when it is burned, it produces carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas. Fossil-fuel burning also produces the acids in acid rain and most of the choking chemicals in urban smog - and oil spills, strip mines, black lung disease, a negative balance of payments and the need to defend the Persian Gulf. Reduction of any of these things would be of both ecological and economic benefit.
\
A carbon tax could help the economy twice over. First, it would correct what economists call an ""externality"" - a cost created by the actions of some that gets shoved off onto others to pay. In this case those who incur the cost are all fuel-users, which means all of us, but particularly those who drive gas-guzzling cars, who heat or cool big, uninsulated houses, who consume the most. The ""others"" who pay include, again, everyone, because we all breathe smog and suffer acid rain, and no one on Earth will escape a climate change. But those who suffer more than their share of the externalities of fossil fuel use are the poor of the present and all the people of the future.
\
The way to correct this externality is to charge, through a tax, the full cost of carbon-burning up front. Then purchasers of fuel-intensive products will get a clear signal about the consequences of their choice. boe Businesses will seek out the cheapest ways of reducing fuel use, up to the point where the cost of further reduction equals the tax rate. The market will allocate pollution reduction to the places where it can be done least expensively.
\
That's economic improvement No. 1: justice and efficiency. Improvement No. 2 is, surprisingly, growth and jobs. The distorting effect of taxes on wages and investment is major. Each dollar of income and capital-gains tax costs the economy another 30 cents to 40 cents in reduced economic activity. If a carbon tax replaced some or all of these distorting taxes, it could benefit the economy so much, some analysts think, that it would increase the growth rate of the gross national product. Because of the tax, that growth would be in fuel-efficient activities, not fuel-squandering ones.
\
There are two problems with a carbon tax, one of which is political. Consumers will experience a carbon tax as a jump in the price of almost everything. tff Producers - the coal, oil and gas industries - are always enthusiastic about the free market until you talk about internalizing their externalities. Then they fight with all the power they've got. Even in a Clinton administration, they've got a lot of power.
\
The other problem with a carbon tax is that the more effective the tax is in inducing the nation to shift toward energy efficiency and renewable energy, the less money it will raise. If we're going to keep the government going, we'll have to raise the tax over time.
\
A steady rise in carbon taxes would be tolerable, if it happened predictably enough for business and consumers to plan their energy-related investments. (ipowSetting the tax at just the right place - not so high that it depresses the economy, not so low that it fails to protect the environment (or fund the government) - would be tricky. But then, deciding the proper rate of any tax is tricky.
\
Denmark, Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands have enacted carbon taxes. Denmark's is $52 per ton of carbon on coal and oil burned in power plants. Denmark's gasoline tax is equivalent to $300 per ton of carbon - typical for Europe. The European Community is discussing a carbon tax that would raise the price of natural gas by one-third, diesel oil by 11 percent, electricity by 13 percent and coal by almost 60 percent.
\
One industry group thinks a carbon tax is a terrific idea - the producers of nuclear power, which does not burn carbon. But if we become rational enough to correct the externalities of fossil fuels, we should correct nuclear externalities, too. That means removing government subsidies and charging a hefty tax on the generation of radioactive wastes.
\
Then, and only then, could we sit back and let the market make energy decisions. For the first time, it would be doing so on the basis of full and unbiased information.

109,"ALBANY, N.Y. * Peabody Energy, the world's biggest private-sector coal company, violated New York laws with misleading statements to investors and the public about the financial risks from climate change and potential regulatory responses, New York's attorney general said Monday.\St. Louis-based Peabody didn't admit or deny those findings in an agreement signed Sunday, but it did agree to revise its shareholder disclosures with the Securities and Exchange Commission to describe possible future reductions in projected demand for coal. The agreement doesn't require the company to pay fines or reimburse New York for the cost of the investigation.\""As a publicly traded company whose core business generates massive amounts of carbon emissions, Peabody Energy has a responsibility to be honest with its investors and the public about the risks posed by climate change, now and in the future,"" Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. His office began investigating Peabody two years ago, though it first made inquiries into the company eight years ago. It subpoenaed similar documents from Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corp. on Wednesday.\Investigators said Peabody repeatedly denied in public filings that it had the ability to predict the impact of regulation, despite internal projections that certain regulatory measures to reduce global warming from carbon emissions would cut coal sales in its primary U.S. markets.\""In March 2013, Peabody projected that if a specific aggressive regulatory action scenario for existing power plants and future electricity generation were to be implemented in the United States, it would in 2025 reduce the dollar value of sales of Southern Powder River Basin coal by 38 percent and Illinois Basin coal by 33 percent,"" the agreement noted. It also cited Peabody consultants' projection that enactment of a $20 per ton carbon tax would cut coal demand as a power generation source by 38 to 53 percent by 2020 compared to 2013 levels.\Peabody said it has agreed to amend its SEC filings.\""There is no other action associated with this settlement, no admission or denial of wrongdoing and no financial penalty,"" Peabody said. ""The company has always sought to make appropriate disclosures.""\The company said it believes technology with more high-efficiency, low-emissions coal-fueled power plants and carbon capture is the bridge to a future with low emissions and rising electricity demand.\The new disclosures say, in part, that the federal Environmental Protection Agency announced final rules on Aug. 3 for regulating carbon dioxide emissions, intended by 2030 to reach a 32 percent reduction from 2005 levels. ""The EPA expects the rule to have a significant impact on the demand for coal-fired electricity generation in the U.S. and, depending upon the implementation methods adopted by the various states, we believe the rule could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.""\Shares of Peabody rose 59 cents on Monday to close at $15.09.\Credit: Michael Virtanen; Associated Press"
110,"ST. LOUIS * A draft of the Democratic Party's policy positions reflects the influence of Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign: endorsing steps to break up large Wall Street banks, advocating a $15 hourly wage, urging an end to the death penalty.\Hillary Clinton's supporters turned back efforts by Sanders' allies to promote a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care system and a carbon tax to address climate change, and freeze hydraulic fracking.\While the platform does not bind the Democratic nominee to the stated positions, it serves as a guidepost for the party moving forward. Party officials approved the draft early Saturday.\The Democratic National Convention's full Platform Committee will discuss the draft at a meeting next month in Orlando, Fla., with a vote at the convention in Philadelphia in late July.\Sanders said Friday that he would vote for Clinton, the presumptive nominee, in the fall election, but he has stopped short of fully endorsing the former secretary of state or encouraging his millions of voters to back her candidacy.\The senator from Vermont has said he wants the platform to reflect his goals and those representing him at the St. Louis Grand Hotel downtown said they had made progress.\""We lost some but we won some,"" said James Zogby, a Sanders supporter on the committee. ""We got some great stuff in the platform that has never been in there before.""\Added Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., a Sanders ally: ""We've made some substantial moves forward.""\Deliberating late into Friday, the group considered language on the Israel-Palestinian conflict, an issue that has divided Democrats. The committee defeated an amendment led by Zogby that would have called for providing Palestinians with ""an end to occupation and illegal settlements"" and urged an international effort to rebuild Gaza.\The draft reflects Clinton's views and advocates working toward a ""two-state solution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict"" that guarantees Israel's security with recognized borders ""and provides the Palestinians with independence, sovereignty and dignity.""\In many cases, Clinton's side gave ground to Sanders'. The document calls for the expansion of Social Security and says Americans should earn at least $15 an hour, referring to the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour as a ""starvation wage,"" a term often used by Sanders.\Sanders has pushed for a $15-an-hour minimum wage. Clinton has supported efforts to raise the minimum wage to that level but has said states and cities should raise the bar as high as possible.\Sanders' allies wanted the draft to specify that a $15 per hour minimum wage should be indexed with inflation. Clinton's side struck down that idea, noting the document included a call to ""raise and index the minimum wage.""\The committee also adopted wording that supports ways to prevent banks from gambling with taxpayers' bank deposits, ""including an updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall.""\Sanders wants to reinstate the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking activities. Clinton does not, but says her proposed financial changes would cast a wider net by regulating the banking system.\Also in the draft is a call for the abolition of the death penalty. Clinton said in a debate this year that capital punishment should only be used in limited cases involving ""heinous crimes."" Sanders said the government should not use it.\Sanders, an ardent foe of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, was unable to get language into the document opposing the trade deal. The party thus avoided a scenario that would have put the platform at odds with President Barack Obama.\Credit: Associated Press"
111,"Human beings tend to be creatures of the moment, which has made dealing with climate change difficult. Odds are very few of us will be around when vast portions of the Earth become uninhabitable. In the meantime, what's a few polar bears?\Obviously this is a massively irresponsible view to take, but until now, it's been how most of the world's nations have reacted to the threat posed by rising atmospheric temperatures caused by carbon emissions. Since 1992, international meetings have been held almost annually seeking some kind of global strategy. For various reasons, most having to do with an unwillingness to sacrifice today for tomorrow, the meetings have come to naught.\Now comes a ray of hope. Against all odds, the 21st Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change succeeded where the 20 previous COPs had failed. Never mind the Kyoto Protocol or the Copenhagen Accords. The Paris Agreement, announced Saturday, says that the nations of the world for the first time agree that global warming is an existential threat requiring concerted, ongoing, accountable national actions.\We have entered, at least tentatively, an era that has needed the coinage of a new word: decarbonization.\Th Paris Agreement signals consensus that the fossil fuel era must end which is fine, unless you're employed by or heavily invested in industries that produce or depend on carbon-based fuels.\The Paris Agreement will succeed only insofar as banks and investors begin shifting money out of carbon-based fuels into alternative energy sources. To judge Paris, it will help to follow the advice offered by Deep Throat during the Watergate investigation: Follow the money.\Much has been made of the agreement's commitment to holding the increase in the global average temperature to ""well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.""\Two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by century's end has been seen as the magic number needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change catastrophic rises in sea levels, desertification of land that is now arable and cataclysmic drought and water wars.\The Earth's average temperature is already nearly 1 degree Celsius higher than it was before the industrial age began burning coal and oil in earnest. With the reductions now in place, temperatures will rise by 2.7 degrees by century's end. That's better than the 4-degree arc that the world was on 20 years ago, but would still pose massive problems super hurricanes and a possible shift in ocean currents among them.\But to hold things under 1.5 degrees would require the world to stop emitting carbon altogether by 2060.\What the Paris Agreement does is acknowledge this reality, and say that avoiding it is a worthwhile goal. It doesn't sound like much, but if that's where the world's thinking is, and the money follows it, it might just happen.\Still there is much room for skepticism. James Hansen of Columbia University, the former NASA scientist generally regarded as the Paul Revere of global warming, called the agreement a ""fraud"" and ""worthless words. There is no action, just promises.""\""As long as fossil fuels appear to be the cheapest fuels out there, they will be continued to be burned,"" Mr. Hansen told the British newspaper The Guardian.\It's true there's little in the way of enforcement built into the agreement. Nations developed their own goals for cutting carbon. Every five years the climate group will assemble to check progress, but there are no sanctions in place.\Nor, for that matter, did the Paris group adopt a system of taxing carbon. Making carbon a taxable luxury, so to speak, would make alternative power sources far more attractive. But the idea has been a political nonstarter in most countries, including the United States, despite support from liberal and conservative economists alike.\Domestic politics lay behind every consideration in Paris. Island nations like the Maldives and the Marshall Islands, which could be wiped out by rising sea levels, obviously pushed for stricter limits and more drastic action.\The Obama administration, knowing that congressional approval would be needed for an international agreement with binding obligations, fought desperately to keep the word ""should"" in place and not the word ""shall.""\In the end, the Paris negotiators got as much as they could politically and finessed the rest. Developed nations promised $100 billion a year to help underdeveloped nations meet their goals, helping to mitigate the old objection that developed nations caused most of the problems.\It helped that public opinion has begun to move. It helped that 2015 will be the hottest year on record. It helped that as the meetings were underway, much of the Northern Hemisphere was experiencing a weirdly warm December and many of the biggest cities in China were being choked by smog.\China, once the outlier at climate talks with its damn-the-emissions, full-speed-ahead attitude, has begun to come around. Its burgeoning middle class would like clean air; even one-party rulers have political considerations.\And it helped that the United States was finally seen by the rest of the world as willing to do its part. President Barack Obama has used executive orders to create a Clean Power Plan. Despite Republican opposition, he has brought rationality to U.S. climate policies. The tireless work in Paris by U.S. negotiators, headed by Secretary of State John Kerry, helped put the exceptional back into U.S. exceptionalism. It helped that France, though racked with immediate concerns about terrorism, stepped up to drive the deal.\Maybe it won't work. Maybe human nature will insist on short-term imperatives instead of long-term good. Maybe the money will chase quarterly gains. Maybe the country will elect a Republican president less concerned with this tough form of international leadership.\But at least future generations will know that our generation gave it a shot.\Credit: By the Editorial Board"
112,"When the Senate takes up legislation next month to confront global warming, environmental groups will have some fervent new allies: evangelicals and other Christian activists.\Concerned about what they see as a moral and biblical issue, religious groups from the right are joining with environmental organizations from the left in supporting strong measures to fight global warming.\Some Christian leaders are using the clout they have built up in Republican circles to lobby conservatives in Congress to support regulations on greenhouse-gas emissions.\""When evangelicals speak, Republicans listen,"" said Richard Cizik, vice president of government affairs for the National Association of Evangelicals. ""And Republicans, frankly, are listening to what we're saying.""\For many religious groups, global warming isn't a political or environmental issue. It's a threat to God's creation.\""It's not a blue state, red state, scientific, or even a green issue,"" said Cizik, whose organization represents 45,000 churches. ""It's a spiritual issue. And that, above all else, is why evangelical Christians should be concerned.""\The once-tiny Christian environmental movement began accelerating quickly in 2006, when 85 prominent evangelical leaders signed on to the Evangelical Climate Initiative calling for action on global warming. The number has climbed to more than 100.\""It's a bit out of the ordinary for evangelicals to be involved with this issue,"" said Jim Jewell, chief operating officer of the Evangelical Environmental Network, a group that educates and mobilizes Christians on environmental issues. ""The evangelical involvement with climate has kind of shaken the political landscape a bit.""\In March, dozens of prominent Southern Baptist leaders called on followers to acknowledge human contributions to global warming, and demanded bold action to address climate change.\They said the church's cautious approach was ""too timid"" in promoting stewardship of God's creation.\""To abandon these issues to the secular world is to shirk from our responsibility..."" they declared. ""The time for timidity regarding God's creation is no more.""\Jonathan Merritt, the 25-year-old seminary student from Atlanta who organized the Baptist environmental declaration, said younger Baptists in particular were relieved to see church leaders take a bold public stance.\Young religious voters aren't abandoning opposition to abortion and gay marriage - issues usually associated with the religious right - but they seem more willing than their parents to look at a broader spectrum of political positions, Merritt said.\""Younger Christians are finding it more pressing to live a life that is consistent with the teachings of Jesus Christ ... rather than toe a party line,"" Merritt said.\The Rev. Larry Rice, director of the New Life Evangelistic Center in St. Louis, has been an outspoken advocate for global warming legislation. The left-leaning minister said Missouri is ""in the dark age when it comes to renewable energy"" and has argued for years that Christians have an obligation to protect the environment.\""There's an ethical principle that runs the whole thread of Christianity here,"" Rice said. ""You can't just say that you love your neighbors as yourself and yet be totally indifferent to how your use of fossil fuels is directly contributing to global warming around the world.""\'Cap-and-trade'\Evangelicals will join an army of lobbyists and lawmakers now suiting up for battle over the most sweeping environmental legislation in years, which the Senate intends to debate early in June.\The bill, sponsored by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman, I-Conn., and John W. Warner, R-Va., would create a program known as ""cap-and-trade"" to limit harmful carbon dioxide emissions.\Under the bill, companies, individuals and government agencies would see their greenhouse gas emissions capped at an annually decreasing level, with the goal of setting emissions in 2050 at 30 percent of 2005 levels.\Entities that come in below their cap could sell their remaining credits to others that pollute beyond their limits. The effect is a sort of carbon tax that encourages pollution reduction.\The bill is already the subject of intense political gamesmanship. Some business lobbyists fear the costs of complying with pollution caps and the penalties for exceeding them. Some environmental groups say the standards are too weak.\Backers of the bill hope support from the religious right will help pressure some Republicans to support the legislation.\""There's a good deal of interaction with folks at traditionally religious organizations, who have joined with environmental organizations to begin work on this,"" said David Sandretti, a spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental interest group.\focus on Missouri\As the action unfolds on Capitol Hill, Missouri's two senators are likely to play important roles.\Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond, a Republican, has for years been one of the loudest critics of the science behind global warming and is a key opponent of the Lieberman-Warner bill.\The Environmental Defense Fund identified Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., as one of 10 ""senators to watch."" McCaskill is undecided on the cap-and-trade bill, saying she favors the concept but worries about how it might affect utility costs for poor people.\McCaskill's staff has discussed cap-and-trade with religious leaders urging her to support the initiative.\""We're paying special attention to Senator McCaskill,"" said the Rev. Jim Ball, a national spokesman for the Evangelical Climate Initiative.\McCaskill's staff also has talked about the issue with religious leaders working with the National Religious Partnership for the Environment, a broad coalition of religious groups that includes Catholic, Jewish and other organizations.\""This is far and away the single highest environmental priority for the American religious community,"" said Paul Gorman, the partnership's executive director.

113,"THE WATER COOLER Post-Dispatch business columnist Linda Tucci is on vacation. She'll return next week.\ * Charles Mueller shuns the risky enterprises adopted by many of his utility's peers, preferring to see the company as a custodian of the area's infrastructure.\ After graduating from St. Louis University with a degree in electrical engineering 42 years ago, Charles Mueller worked first for Union Electric Co. and now its parent company, Ameren Corp.\ Promoted to chief executive in 1994 and now chairman, he did not follow other utilities into Enron-like side businesses, such as energy trading, that have proved disastrous.\ Ameren has grown under Mueller, acquiring two Illinois electric companies in six years. Today, it's the largest utility in Missouri and the second largest in Illinois.\ Mueller has a second job of sorts. He's a booster for the region, especially downtown St. Louis, and he backs that up with membership on several organizations' boards.\ A lot of utility companies are paying the price for making risky business decisions over the last decade. Why did Ameren stay the course?\ I always argue, why should I know better how to run a savings- and-loan than a guy who has been doing it for 30 years? The old argument is, if you bring nothing to the table but your money, you typically will leave without your money. If you don't have the expertise, why would you be there? . . . In the 1980s, it was very fashionable to diversify into businesses that you knew very little about. We didn't do that. We stuck to our knitting.\ Is Ameren stock still a solid conservative investment?\ We view it as a relatively conservative investment. We think it's essential for us to remain financially strong. A lot of the companies that used leverage and took on a lot of debt are the ones that went bankrupt.\ We view our bond rating as being a critical element of who we are and financial strength as being absolutely critical. We pay a substantial dividend, typically in the area of 6 percent. In today's environment, there aren't many investments where you can get 6 percent that are conservative investments.\ Ameren has made two major acquisitions over the last six years, but you have the same number of employees as 15 years ago. Do you deserve criticism for eliminating jobs?\ I would argue that we are not the employer of last resort. We are the infrastructure of the area. If our costs get out of line, (the region loses) all the manufacturers and the manufacturing jobs. So, it's up to us to keep our costs down.\ We absolutely have to be efficient. We provide very good jobs. We believe we pay our employees well and treat them fairly and give them safe working conditions. But it is our job not to have excess employees.\ Your energy rates are about 20 percent below the national average. How important are low electric rates in promoting community growth?\ I don't think any utility can divorce itself from the economy of the local service territory. I think as the economy of St. Louis goes and the Missouri-Illinois region we serve goes, so goes our business. Frankly, we have a vested interest. And we live here. We want a good place for our kids and grandkids.\ Illinois is a deregulated-utility state. Missouri is regulated. How does that complicate your job?\ I've characterized it as having a foot in two different canoes and they're going apart down the river. It does diverge. But really, when it gets down to the guts of the business, you have to operate the same way in either case. Customers are customers, and they expect the same service.\ Would you prefer that Missouri deregulate?\ From a philosophical standpoint, I think we are efficient enough, and we can compete. We could handle it well. It would simplify our life. But it has to be done right. And frankly, after the California problems (with shortages and soaring power rates), it's not likely to happen in a state like Missouri for many years to come.\ Ameren depends heavily on a variety of fuels to create power, including coal, nuclear and natural gas. How important is that diversity?\ Fuel diversity is critical to us. We are a large coal-fired generating utility, to the point where about two-thirds of our energy is coal. But we absolutely have to be able to burn coal. There are pushes on for certain types of environmental constraints, like a carbon tax, which would absolutely kill the ability to burn coal economically.\ But burning coal is a major contributor to air pollution.\ We are very proud of the cleanliness with which we burn coal. Since 1990, we have reduced sulfur dioxide emissions and nitrogen oxide emissions by 60 percent and increased coal burn by 60 percent. So, you're burning a whole lot more and emitting a whole lot less.\ And if you look at the energy situation in this country, where the gas is now in short supply and it's costing twice as much as a year ago, there are no more sources to go to. You absolutely have to continue burning coal, or you would hamstring the economy.\ I argue that we're environmentalists. We have kids and grandkids, too. We want a great environment. But you have to put your resources in the right places, because they're limited.\ Will nuclear power continue to be part of that mix?\ Our nuclear power is by far our least-expensive energy source right now. The fuel side of it costs less than half of the coal side, and the coal side costs a third of what the gas does. So, it is a very valuable asset. It is a non-polluting asset.\ I do think from a national energy standpoint, we will have to look at the nuclear option. By we, I'm talking about the United States, not the company.\ Ameren has kept its headquarters downtown when it could be anywhere. Why stay when so many other companies have left the city?\ We have always been in downtown St. Louis, and as far as I'm concerned, we always will be. It is the core of the metropolitan area, and as downtown goes, the metropolitan area goes.\ What is downtown's future?\ It's been a tough time, but I truly believe downtown is coming back. We've got a lot of projects going. I think the (new Cardinals) ballpark will be great for downtown. I think from an economic development standpoint, it's a great thing.\ As the mayor likes to say, there are enough things going on that we are going to be able to connect the dots. Pretty soon, it's going to make a unified neighborhood and change the character of the city.\ ==========\ CHARLES MUELLER, chairman and chief executive of Ameren Corp.\ Age: 64\ Education: St. Louis University, bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, 1961; St. Louis University, master's degree in business administration, 1966; Washington University Executive Institute for Advanced Study, 1990.\ Residence: Lives in Belleville with his wife, Jan\ Career: He joined Union Electric Co., now part of Ameren, as an engineer in 1961; senior vice president of administrative services, 1988; c ompany president, 1993; chief executive, 1994.\ Affiliations: Board chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the St. Louis Children's Hospital.

If you were old enough to drive a car before the Arab oil embargo of 1973, you probably delight in telling the younger crowd about the good old days when gasoline was 30-some cents a gallon.
\
Here's an eye-opening fact, then - and a shut-up-the-geezer comeback for the youngsters: After adjustment for inflation, the 1972 average price of 36.1 cents a gallon comes out to $1.22 in today's dollars.
\
Yes, gasoline is cheaper today than it was in 1972. Unleaded regular sold for an average $1.10 a gallon across the nation last week, according to the American Automobile Association. The AAA Auto Club of Missouri pegged the St. Louis average price at 91.5 cents.
\
Dennis Eklof, senior consultant at Cambridge Energy Research Group in Boston, said gasoline is even cheaper when measured against Americans' personal income. By that measure, he said, gasoline is the cheapest it's been since World War II.
\
What's more, American gasoline is dirt cheap by international standards. Italian drivers pay more than $5 a gallon, Britons and Japanese pay close to $4 and Canadians and Australians pay about $2. Lower taxes account for much, but not all, of the U.S. price advantage.

But you can expect higher energy taxes to be a prime topic of discussion in Washington as Bill Clinton looks for ways to cut the federal budget deficit and Al Gore seeks ways to clean up the environment.
\
During the presidential campaign, Clinton was critical of Ross Perot's plan for a 50-cent-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax over five years. But more recently, his two top appointees to the Office of Management and Budget, Leon Panetta and Alice Rivlin, have spoken favorably about the idea of raising the gas tax.
\
Consumers have already endured a five-cent federal tax increase in 1991 and various state tax increases, including a two-cent rise in Missouri last year. But the tax on a gallon of gasoline, adjusted for inflation, is less today than it was in 1972.
\
The current federal gasoline tax is 14 cents a gallon, and states add an average tax of 20 cents on top of that. Missouri's state tax is 13 cents a gallon; Illinois levies a 19-cent gas tax plus a 5 percent sales tax.
\
Sensing the Clinton administration's interest in the issue, lobbyists are already lining up behind their favorite energy-tax ideas.
\
Carmakers say they could live with a higher gasoline tax, seeing that as preferable to stiffer fuel-efficiency rules.
\
Oil producers would rather have an oil-import fee, which would make their domestically produced oil relatively more valuable.
\
Environmentalists would support a higher gasoline tax, but would prefer a carbon tax that would hit all fossil fuels, including coal.
\
Clinton may yet decide that a significant rise in the gasoline tax would be political suicide because of the effect it would have on every driver's pocketbook.
\
""The American consumer has a really emotional reaction to gasoline taxes,"" Eklof said. ""We act as if it's our God-given right to drive wherever we want, whenever we want, as much as we want.""
\
But, precisely because gasoline is a consumer good, a higher gas tax would be less harmful to the economy than the alternatives.
\
The oil-import fee would not only provide a big windfall to domestic producers, but it would hurt all big energy users, from farm to factory to power plant.
\
""That is going to hurt the competitiveness of U.S. exports,"" Eklof said. Such export ""stars"" as agriculture and the petrochemical industry are very energy-intensive, he noted.
\
The same criticism applies in spades to the carbon tax, which would have the additional political liability of being hard on coal producers.
\
""If you believe carbon dioxide emissions pose a long-term climate threat, then that (the carbon tax) is the way to go,"" Eklof said. ""Right now there's very little public support for it.""
\
Eklof says that either the oil-import fee or the carbon tax would have geopolitical implications. That is, they wouldn't make Saudi Arabia very happy.
\
The Saudis registered a strong protest last year when the European Community proposed a carbon tax, Eklof said.
\
Despite the political difficulties involved in getting a gasoline-tax increase passed, Eklof believes that's the most likely energy-tax proposal to emerge from Congress.
\
""If we get one, it'll be something phased in over three to four years, at 10 to 15 cents a gallon,"" he predicted.
\
That would be just enough to boost the price of a gallon back to the pre-1973 level, after adjusting for inflation.

President Bill Clinton's proposed energy tax is likely to bring a future in which Americans will pay more for heat, lighting and travel.
\
Regardless of the details in his speech tonight, Clinton is certain to anger many people who see hardship - and not constructive belt-tightening - in higher fuel costs.
\
""I think when you see the whole program, it won't be raw pain for everybody,"" Clinton said Tuesday in a meeting with congressional leaders.
\
Nonetheless, the energy portion of his plan may take a high-powered sales job.
\
And judging from recent polls, people may be less concerned about the deficit than about keeping energy prices cheaper than what most of the world pays.
\
This much is known about the plan Clinton will present:
\
The tax is likely to be based broadly on BTUs, meaning the heat content of all fuels - oil, gas, coal and nuclear power - measured in British Thermal Units.
\
Coal producers in Southern Illinois and elsewhere may already have dodged a bullet if the administration has rejected a ""carbon"" tax, which most experts believe. Even so, coal could be hit hard in a percentage levy because it is cheaper by BTU content than oil or natural gas.
\
In choosing a BTUs tax, Clinton appears to have given more weight to economic concerns than to the environment. Also, a BTUs tax might be less objectionable than some options because it would be hidden in many places rather than showing up only at the gas pump or in a single bill.
\
But Clinton's proposal has many unanswered questions that will determine just how it will affect household budgets:
\
Will the BTUs tax be applied at the wholesale level or at another point in the energy business? Several experts said that a tax would likely be levied at the wholesale level - when a utility buys coal to make electricity, for instance.
\
Will the tax have a means to punish fuels that pollute the heaviest? In other words, might there be a ""back-door"" carbon tax that hits coal harder than what is readily apparent?
\
And will Clinton offer exemptions to protect solar, wind and ""renewable"" energies rather than taxing them like other sources?
\
One expert said Tuesday that Clinton's energy package could have ""a hundred different options"" as part of a BTUs tax and that the true effects could take days to sort out.
\
What is clear is that energy producers already have started mobilizing taxpayers for a lobbying campaign in which literally billions of dollars will be on the table.
\
""We still think that he has a whole host of options and that he's still floating trial balloons,"" said John Grasser, spokesman for the National Coal Association.
\
High-sulfur coal mined in Southern Illinois could be saddled with extra taxes because it is higher than most coal in BTUs.
\
The price of a million BTUs of coal figures to between $1.40 and $1.50. Natural gas is roughly $2 and oil about $2.50.
\
So any tax applied equally would put a higher percentage on coal.
\
Coal operators worry about these increases because they could make natural gas more attractive when the two fuels compete for industrial customers.
\
Bill O'Keefe, who heads the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, argues that any across-the-board energy tax will damage the economy. Companies could be especially hindered if they require heavy energy for production, he said.
\
Environmental advocates see the energy tax as a golden chance to force conservation as well as to reduce the fossil fuel gases that are changing climate and damaging the Earth's atmosphere.
\
But some of them are concerned that Clinton might limit the success if he leans toward generalities tonight and opens the proceedings to intensive bartering.
\
""Everybody will want to monkey with it in a different way, and it has the potential to become unraveled,"" said Christopher Flavin, vice president of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington.
"

After two years of work, a panel of business, government and science leaders said the United States must reject the ""false dichotomy"" of jobs vs. environmental protection. The panel said the nation must adopt sweeping policy changes to link the pursuits of economic and environmental health.
\
Toward that end, the report of the National Commission on the Environment recommended Friday that the federal government adopt tax policies to stimulate ""green"" research and development.
\
The study calls for elimination of price-distorting subsidies, taxes on environmentally harmful activities and more realistic means of calculating economic activity.
\
The report is being offered to President-elect Bill Clinton as a blueprint for his administration,
\
More specifically, the report says the United States should gradually increase gasoline taxes over several years, levy a carbon tax to be phased in gradually, and reduce or eliminate water subsidies to growers.
\
In its specifics, the commission's recommendations are similar to many that environmentalists have called for before.
\
But the work is likely to receive special attention in the new administration because of the makeup of the panel, which was convened and funded by the World Wildlife Fund.
\
Russell Train, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was the panel's chairman. Members included executives from such companies as Southern California Edison and Alcoa, along with officials and prospective appointees of the Clinton administration. Among them were Alice M. Rivlin, Clinton's choice for deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget; former Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, an adviser to Clinton during both the campaign and transition; and James G. Speth, an adviser to Clinton for the environment.
\
Among the panel's recommendations were to:
\
Adopt tax credits or other research and development incentives to stimulate savings and investment in new environmental technology.
\
Impose a carbon tax, starting at about $6 a ton and eventually reaching $30 a ton, to discourage the use of fossil fuels that cause serious pollution.
\
Despite the political influence of their proponents, some of the recommendations would appear to face a bleak future.
\
A prime example is the suggested increase in the federal gasoline tax. The idea was sharply opposed by Clinton when it was suggested by former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas during the Democratic primaries and later by Ross Perot. Train conceded that it was ""highly unlikely that either the administration or Congress will jump to embrace our recommendation.""
\
It will take time, he added, ""before the country at large or politicians are ready to bite that kind of a bullet.""
\
Train said he hoped the recommendations will be discussed during economic meetings next week in Little Rock, Ark., and will be the subject of congressional hearings early next year.
"
117,"
This is going to be a column that praises President Barack Obama's new charm offensive with congressional Republicans and suggests some useful background reading for the leaders' next get-together. First, though, I've got to get a bit of snark out of the way.
\
Such as: Isn't this the same Obama who decreed that playing nice with Washington wasn't working, so he'd be taking his case straight to ""the people""? It's a false choice between the two approaches, but this tactical switcheroo is rather dizzying.
\
And, excuse me, if the White House thinks it's worth the try, couldn't Obama have attempted this a few months ago, before the sequester kicked in?
\
Still, let's look ahead. It is hard to imagine a breakthrough without intensive presidential involvement, which makes the new outreach so welcome. I know Republican senators, prospective members of Obama's common-sense caucus, who have waited in vain over the past few years for a call from the White House chief of staff, no less the president himself.
\
Meanwhile, there are a few incipient signs of thaw on the Republican side, indications that Obama's mealtime diplomacy might not be futile. Specifically, several Republican senators -- Arizona's John McCain, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, New Hampshire's Kelly Ayotte -- have dared to say that they would -- gasp! -- consider raising revenue.
\
The senators attach two caveats: Revenue must come through fundamental tax reform (getting rid of loopholes, not raising rates) and be accompanied by reining in entitlement spending.
\
In theory, both sides agree on these approaches. In practice, the entitlement debate in particular has become mired in unnecessary partisan line-drawing. One side deems as essential proposals that the other has declared anathema. Two prime examples: turning Medicare into a premium support (scary version, ""voucher"") program, and raising the Medicare eligibility age. Endlessly arguing over those is not likely to accomplish anything in the current environment.
\
Hence this suggested reading: a new report from the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project, ""15 Ways to Rethink the Federal Budget."" Granted, the Hamilton Project is associated with Democratic policymakers, albeit centrist ones such as its co-founder, Robert Rubin; its animating vision of government is not the same as, say, Paul Ryan's. So proposals such as a carbon tax or value-added tax, however sensible, aren't likely to fly in the current climate.
\
But the Hamilton report contains several ideas that even Ryan could love -- or, at the very least, that the House Budget Committee chairman should not reject out of hand.
\
For example, where Ryan proposes giving Medicare beneficiaries a set amount with which to obtain insurance, Michael Chernew of Harvard Medical School and Dana Goldman of the University of Southern California propose giving Medicare providers a set amount to cover beneficiaries.
\
This ""global payment"" would replace the perverse incentives of the current fee-for-service system -- to bill for as many procedures and services as possible -- with a spur toward efficient, comprehensive care. This approach exists currently in the form of the private Medicare Advantage programs that serve about a quarter of beneficiaries (and that, notably, have been a darling of Republicans) and in Accountable Care Organizations being established under Obamacare. Estimated savings: $100 billion over 10 years.
\
Another idea, from MIT's Jonathan Gruber, would attack Medicare costs from the consumer side. It would deal with the current risk of catastrophic costs by adding an out-of-pocket maximum tied to beneficiaries' incomes so that poorer seniors would face less risk.
\
But it would also heavily tax seniors' supplemental insurance plans that fail to impose adequate cost-sharing on beneficiaries. Again, this proposal could appeal to both sides: The Obama administration has suggested limiting Medigap policies, and the Ryan approach is all about giving consumers incentive to control costs. Estimated savings: $125 billion over 10 years.
\
On the tax side, Alan Viard of the American Enterprise Institute proposes replacing the home mortgage interest deduction with a tax credit worth 15 percent of annual interest on the first $300,000 of a mortgage -- spreading the tax benefits of homeownership more fairly and avoiding subsidizing ever-bigger homes. Estimated savings: $300 billion over 10 years.
\
Karen Dynan of Brookings proposes changing tax incentives to encourage low- and moderate-income households to save more for retirement and education while reducing the subsidies for wealthier taxpayers. Estimated savings: $40 billion over 10 years.
\
The two sides are talking. That's good. Before the next meal, they might take a look at the Hamilton report.
\
It could help the conversation move beyond ""no new taxes"" and ""please pass the salt.""

Migrant caravan sets out from Honduras for U.S.\Hundreds of Honduran migrants, many carrying young children, set out in a caravan for that country's border with Guatemala on Wednesday, hoping to reach the United States.\Some of those who gathered at the San Pedro Sula bus station said they couldn't support their families with what they can earned in Honduras and were seeking better opportunities.\Most boarded buses before dawn that would carry them to towns on the Guatemalan border. Others walked through the rain, some pushing strollers or carrying sleeping children in their arms.\Guatemalan immigration authorities said that their Honduran counterparts informed them that about 1,100 migrants, most of them aboard buses, were headed for their common border at two crossing points. They said some were already crossing into Guatemala.\Presidential election date set in Algeria - Algeria's newly appointed interim leader set on Wednesday the date for a presidential election as July 4, the day before the nation celebrates its independence day.\Abdelkader Bensalah was appointed on Tuesday to replace former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was pressured by massive protests to step down after two decades in office. Protests have continued, however, with people on the streets demanding that he, the government and all those linked to Bouteflika's reign should also leave.\Thousands of protesters were in the streets again Wednesday. Union officials from an array of sectors organized work stoppages. Hundreds filled the square in front of the Grande Poste, the capital's central post office that has become synonymous with the protests. Lines of police in riot gear stood by, backed by a water cannon.\Cubans are warned to expect shortages - Communist Party leader Raul Castro is warning Cubans to brace for shortages and other economic problems due to the policies of the administration of President Donald Trump.\In his first speech to the nation in more than three months, Castro said Wednesday that U.S. pressure on Venezuela and Cuba could lead to already notable shortages' increasing sharply in coming months. It has become hard to find basic goods such as chicken, cooking oil, eggs and flour in recent months. State-run newspapers cut their page count last week because of shortages of newsprint.\Germany considers carbon tax - Germany's environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change. Speaking after the first meeting of a special ""climate Cabinet,"" German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.\Mexico defeating fuel theft - Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador says his administration has nearly stamped out the fuel theft that has plagued the country for years.\LÃ³pez Obrador sent the military after the fuel thieves shortly after taking office in December. In November, thieves were stealing an average of 81,000 barrels of gasoline per day, mostly by illegally tapping pipelines. Official figures indicate that the daily loss was down to 8,000 barrels a day last month, and through the first week in April, it was averaging 5,000 barrels per day.\LÃ³pez Obrador said Wednesday it was proof that his government would not tolerate corruption.\Fuel theft cost the government more than $3.4 billion last year. If the current strategy continues to work, the president said, Mexico could save more than $2.6 billion this year.\Cyclone's death toll exceeds 1,000 - The death toll from the cyclone that ripped into southern Africa last month is now above 1,000, while the number of cholera cases among survivors has risen above 4,000.\The United Nations has described Cyclone Idai, which hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi nearly a month ago, as ""one of the deadliest storms on record in the southern hemisphere.""\Zimbabwe's information minister on Tuesday said the death toll in that country had risen to 344. Mozambique has reported 602 deaths and Malawi at least 59.\A cholera outbreak among survivors was declared in Mozambique on March 27 and had led to 4,072 cases and seven deaths as of Tuesday morning, according to government figures.\From news services"
119," It shouldn't be surprising to see Tom Carnahan canvassing northwest Missouri in a pickup, shaking hands and talking up farmers about energy policy and revitalizing the rural economy.\ After all, he's the son of late Gov. Mel Carnahan and ex-U.S. Sen. Jean Carnahan. Older brother Russ is a U.S. congressman. Sister Robin is secretary of state. Campaigning is in his DNA.\ But this Carnahan isn't running for office. He's crusading for another cause: the wind.\ Carnahan is the founder of Wind Capital Group LLC, which last month celebrated the completion of the Bluegrass Ridge wind farm in northwest Missouri - the state's first. The company is developing three more wind projects in the same area and pursuing a dozen projects in seven states outside of Missouri.\ ""As recently as three or four years ago, there was a view that there weren't any good wind sites in this state,"" said Jim Jura, general manager of Springfield, Mo.-based Associated Electric Cooperative, which agreed to buy the electricity produced from the Wind Capital projects for the next 20 years. ""Lo and behold, Tom went out and he had a vision.""\ While the wind energy business faces challenges, Carnahan's timing couldn't be better. Demand for renewable energy is growing. Anything ""green"" is hot because of increasing concern about global warming and a desire for home-grown energy that reduces the nation's dependence on foreign petroleum.\ ""It's good that people are becoming aware of their impact on the environment,"" Carnahan said during an interview at his downtown St. Louis offices. ""I don't see this as a fad. We are creating real energy, real electrons, that are powering real homes every single day.""\ AN IDEA IS BORN\ Carnahan, 38, plunged into the business without an engineering degree or an energy background. In fact, three years ago, he was still practicing law - something he knew wasn't his future.\ ""I never felt like the law practice was where I fit in,"" he said. ""I was always looking for opportunities to get distracted.""\ In 2005, he left his practice, Carnahan & Garvin LLC, to form a new venture - the Carnahan Group. His new company had a name, but no business plan.\ Carnahan had been fascinated by renewable energy, recalling a family dinner table conversation after his dad took him to a Missouri ethanol plant while he was governor.\ But it wasn't until he was scanning the American Wind Energy Association website one night in late 2004 that the seeds for Wind Capital were sewn.\ It happened when he saw a color-coded U.S. map showing existing and planned wind energy projects.\ ""It was so stark because the states were colored in if there was a wind project, and if there wasn't one it was just white,"" Carnahan said. ""Literally every state that surrounded Missouri was colored in, and Missouri just stood out like a sore thumb.\ Carnahan dove in to find out why Missouri didn't have a wind farm and what was needed to build one. He attended industry conferences and solicited advice from anyone who would talk to him. Some of it he didn't want to hear.\ In particular, there was a conversation with an energy executive who's among the biggest players in the wind energy business. He acknowledged Carnahan's gumption and told him that he'd never get a project done in Missouri.\ Besides a perception that Missouri wasn't very windy, it traditionally has had among the lowest electric rates in the United States, and there's no mandate requiring utilities to invest in renewable energy.\ ""I didn't know what I was doing wasn't possible,"" Carnahan said. ""But it also meant that we didn't have a lot of competition.""\ Carnahan said others would roll their eyes when he explained his career change - to the point that he avoided the subject.\ ""I'd say, 'I'm building a wind farm,' and people just immediately wrote me off as nuts,"" he said. ""It seemed far-fetched. It got to the point where I just told people I was still practicing law.""\ PEOPLE SKILLS\ Wind Capital was formed in January 2005. Carnahan began developing his first project that spring, and initially did much of the work himself.\ He arranged leases with farmers, negotiated power agreements and transmission issues.\ What Carnahan lacked in technical knowledge he made up for with his people skills, Jura said.\ ""A key to putting these deals together is working with the landowners in a constructive way, and he mastered that,"" he said. ""I knew his dad, and he's a lot like him in that way.""\ Today, with 11 employees split between offices in St. Louis and Madison, Wis., Carnahan is in position to delegate more of the responsibility. But he still cherishes his role as that of developer and deal maker, going on the road to sell his projects.\ ""That's the fun part,"" he said. ""To drive around in a pickup on some guy's farm looking at different spots and getting to call it work.""\ John McKinnon, who raises cattle on 80 acres just northeast of King City, was among the farmers who signed a 25-year agreement to put one of the massive turbines on his property.\ He instantly hit it off with Carnahan.\ ""Farmers are the biggest skeptics there are,"" McKinnon said. ""But he was honest. He laid everything out. He's a suit and tie, but he can put on a denim shirt with the best of us.""\ Carnahan grew up on a farm just outside Rolla. He attended William Jewel College and then went to the University of Missouri Law School in Columbia.\ Robin Carnahan, who's been Missouri secretary of state since 2005, said people skills have always been a strength for her brother.\ ""Tom was the youngest in the family, so he's always been very social and been able to get along with a wide range of people,"" she said.\ TILTING AT WINDMILLS\ Scattered throughout Carnahan's new headquarters at 1010 Market Street are tiny plastic models of the 300-foot-tall turbines rising from the northwest Missouri plains.\ The tan walls of his corner office are bare, for now. Photos and prints sit stacked on the floor. Across from his desk is a tiny sculpture of Don Quixote - a gift from his mom.\ But Carnahan isn't tilting at windmills, he's building more of them.\ Wind Capital's second and third wind projects, Cow Branch and Conception, each will be able to generate about 50 megawatts when they go into service later this year.\ A fourth, smaller project, Loess Hills, is just 5 megawatts, but it's enough to offset all of the energy use in the tiny town of Rock Port, about an hour north of Kansas City.\ The projects are part of the estimated 3,000 megawatts of wind power generating capacity that will be installed nationwide this year - enough to power about 750,000 homes, according to the American Wind Energy Association.\ But with the rapid growth comes challenges, including a shortage of turbines and stiff local opposition to some projects in other parts of the country.\ The capital costs of wind farms also are expensive relative to the amount of energy produced. But while costs for fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas have escalated sharply in recent years, wind is free.\ And the economics could become more compelling if Congress limits emissions of carbon dioxide.\ ""We can't compete on price head-to-head with coal plants that were built 20 years ago,"" Carnahan said.\ ""But if policymakers decide that they want to add a cost to coal production in the form of a carbon tax, it certainly does make wind energy a lot more attractive.""\ ---\ TOM CARNAHAN\ Title: President, Wind Capital Group\ Age: 38\ Resides: St. Louis\ Family: Wife, Lisa; daughter, Sydney\ Education: William Jewell College; University of Missouri School of Law (Columbia)\ Credit: Jeffrey Tomich; ST.

120,"NOA\BY NEAL ETHRIDGE\Does the romantic relationship between the News-Leader and City Utilities have no bounds? Perhaps the most unprofessional editorial I have ever read appeared in the May 26 edition of the News-Leader. This is a ""kill the whistle-blower"" response to the facts that were disclosed in the press conference May 24 conducted by the Ratepayers for Affordable Utilities and presided over by former Mayor Lee Gannaway.\First of all, the editorial was riddled with inaccuracies. The editorial charges that the Voter's Guide sent to voters prior to the 2004 bond issue election was inaccurate and misleading. Never in the past two years has the newspaper, CU or, for that matter, anyone else provided any information that shows that anything in our guide was inaccurate. We stated there were more than 200 Midwest utilities that sold power for less than CU when CU had constantly published that CU was either the very cheapest or certainly one of the lowest in the entire U.S. We were correct in that statement as well as everything else presented.\Mr. Gannaway did not take the facts out of context. He provided supporting CU documents to prove each point he made. He pointed out that CU's comparison that threatens voters with a 29 percent increase in rates if they vote no was made using the Peabody/Prairie States proposal even though CU's Black & Veatch consultant clearly stated the GRDA/Tenaska proposal was the best solution of all the proposals reviewed by Black & Veatch. The 29-year average cost per kilowatt hour from GRDA/Tenaska was estimated by Black & Veatch to be 5.04 cents whereas the Peabody average was 6.72 cents or 33 percent more.\So, who is misleading whom?\Did the News-Leader ask CU when and how it came up with the 4.5 cents per kilowatt hour cost of producing power at the new power plant? How many years did it forecast forward? The Tenaska/GRDA at 5.04 is for 2010 thru 2039. In fact, Black & Veatch forecast the 2012 cost to only be 4.05 cents. Mr. Gannaway gave the News-Leader documents showing that CU had claimed in a response to a Sunshine Law request that CU did not have any calculations as to the cost per kilowatt hour for SW2. Obviously, the News-Leader does not require intellectual honesty as a prerequisite for employment.\The only thing I find that I can agree on in your editorial is your next to last paragraph where you state, ""Look at the facts, not rhetoric.""\However, your reporting would at least be more balanced and fair if you would print those facts the Ratepayers gave you which are relevant and cannot be denied.\The Ratepayers for Affordable Utilities mailed out another Voter's Guide 10 days prior to the election. The information provided therein has been checked and double checked for accuracy. If you find any incorrect information, I am sure you will bring it to everyone's attention.\NO\BY PAUL L. REDFEARN JR.\The bond issue on June 6 to authorize City Utilities to build a new coal-fired power plant should be defeated. This has been a difficult decision for me to make since I originally supported a smaller coal-fired power plant. I was wrong.\At the time I was not fully aware of how viable wind-generated power is today. Wind-generated power is the fastest growing alternative in the country. It is a proven technology, one that can meet Springfield's needs for electrical power, is non-polluting and the fuel is free. Wind towers can be incrementally built as the need arises. Although the Energy Supply Task Force recommended a coal-fired plant, its recommendation was based on incomplete information since it did not hear from experts on wind generation and did not consider the effect of a national carbon tax that is likely to be imposed in the near future. Such a tax will significantly increase the cost of energy from coal-fired plants.\I am also deeply troubled by the effect of a large rate increase to customers who now use less energy. Is it fair to ask customers who use less energy to pay the same rates as those who use a lot more energy?\Furthermore, CU has proposed few measures to dampen the demand for energy. It should be proposing time-of-day charges, peak-demand control devices and a base rate that increases with higher consumption, resulting in fair rates to those unable to further reduce their electrical needs. Such measures would be a significant incentive to hold down demand and encourage efficient energy use.\So what will happen if this bond issue is defeated? The lights will continue to go on when we flip the switch. CU will meet our energy needs by purchasing a minimum of off-system power, by accepting and aggressively implementing alternate energy sources, by conservation and energy efficient investments and by changing its rate schedule to one of incremental increases based on consumption.\And, best of all, by not building a new coal-fired unit, Springfield will make a positive contribution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, the main culprit in global warming.\It makes no sense for Springfield to build a coal-fired power plant that will: (1) put us, the owners, in debt for 30 years; (2) be dependent on distant coal suppliers and a single rail company to deliver coal to us; (3) need to have expensive retrofits for new emission controls; (4) continue to pollute our air, streams and lakes; and (5) contribute to global warming.\Our civic leaders realize that changes in energy generation and use must occur, but they seem reluctant to even talk about it. Their position reminds me of a prayer attributed to St. Augustine, ""O Lord help me to be pure but not yet.""\YES\BY RONALD REYNAUD\We have the privilege of serving this community as members of the Board of Public Utilities. We each work hard to understand the issues and make policy decisions to benefit the entire community. Our goal is to make sure essential services are dependable, affordable and responsible.\As you think about future power supply for Springfield, it is important to consider the exhaustive process City Utilities has followed since August 2004. All of the options have been studied extensively by City Utilities' staff, by third-party power industry experts and by a local citizens' task force. All arrived at the same conclusion: Local control of our energy future means lower prices, higher reliability and responsible environmental stewardship.\It's easy to complain from the sidelines especially when you have no responsibility to make sure the lights stay on. But three compelling facts cannot be dismissed by detractors who provide misleading, out-of-context information and what this newspaper has termed ""dirty tricks.""\Fact one: Local energy means lower bills. Electricity prices are going to increase with or without a new power plant. However, electric prices will be much lower from a local plant compared to a purchase from outside suppliers. If we build locally, at an existing site, we save money because we already own land, a railroad loop, facilities and other infrastructure, including experienced staff. According to Black & Veatch, Southwest 2 is the low-cost option.\Fact two: Local energy means better reliability. The transmission system in our region is limited in capacity. In fact, it has experienced more interruptions than any other region in America. Then, to upgrade the system is a costly proposition. And even after these upgrades, energy generated miles and miles away from Springfield simply isn't as reliable as hometown energy. Additionally, physical threats, like severe weather, are inherent with long spans of wire, stretched over many counties and even through other states.\Fact three: Local energy means cleaner air. Probably the best kept secret in Springfield is the fact that CU air emissions from its local coal generating units have decreased 85 percent since 1980. Future improvements at these existing stations, plus the addition of a new, cleaner, state-of-the-art unit, will push those reductions to 93 percent by 2011. So, the air quality in Springfield/Greene County will be even better with Southwest 2.\One more fact. Working with City Utilities in the past has given us the opportunity to witness first-hand the professionalism and thoroughness of the utility's staff. We're thankful Springfield is in control of our utility and our energynot outsiders. We urge you to vote yes on June 6 to keep it that way.\YES\BY JAMES J. JURA\As a City Utilities customer and 25-year employee in the electric utility industry, I believe CU's proposal before Springfield voters for an additional coal-based generator at Southwest Power Station is the best way to meet the growing electricity needs of its customers.\In my work with electric cooperatives in Missouri, Iowa and Oklahoma, our members tell us to focus on two things: a reliable and an affordable supply of electricity. Our members expect us to do that and at the same time continue to protect the air, land and water.\Electricity demand continues to grow both locally and nationally, and new power plants are needed. During the last few decades great strides have been made in energy efficiency. Today, the U.S. economy produces twice as many goods and services per unit of energy consumed as in 1970.\Even with this tremendous growth in productivity and growth in our economy, the environment has improved, contrary to popular myth. The facts show emissions of air pollutants related to human health have dropped 54 percent since 1970 according to the Environmental Protection Agency. While air quality was improving in the U.S., our population grew 40 percent, our economy grew by 187 percent, vehicle miles traveled increased by 171 percent and the use of coal to generate electricity increased by 205 percent.\Affordable electricity from coal is a big reason CU customers currently enjoy some of the lowest electric rates in the country. Missouri families and businesses rely on coal-based generation for 86 percent of their electricity, largely the reason Missouri's retail electricity rates are the 11th lowest in the country and 20 percent below the national average. Keeping rates low is especially important for customers with low incomes who have less disposable income to spend on energy costs.\To fulfill its obligation of continued reliable, affordable service to its customers, CU is planning ahead. The electric system I work for is also planning ahead. To meet growing demand, we are planning a coal power plant for our future.\We've studied many other possibilities, including emerging technologies such as integrated gasification combined cycle. Our current research shows, like that of CU, energy from a coal plant is the best option for our rural electric cooperative members.\Equipped with the best emissions control technology available, a new coal plant will assure that we continue to reduce emissions and help the environment, as well as help preserve the strong economy and quality of life we enjoy in Springfield.\By voting yes on the proposed bond issue to finance the construction of the power plant, Springfield citizens will help ensure City Utilities continues to provide affordable, reliable power while protecting the environment.\Neal Ethridge of Springfield is a member of the Ratepayers for Affordable Utilities.\Paul L. Redfearn Jr. of Springfield is emeritus professor of biology at Missouri State University.\Ronald Reynaud of Springfield is the chairman of the Board of Public Utilities. This letter was also signed by all members of the utilities board.\James Jura of Springfield is the CEO and general manager of Associated Electric Cooperative Inc., a wholesale power cooperative serving more than 800,000 customers.\""The 29-year average cost per kilowatt hour from GRDA/Tenaska was estimated by Black & Veatch to be 5.04 cents where the Peabody average was 6.72 cents or 33 percent more.\So, who is misleading whom?""\Neal Ethridge, member of Ratepayers for Affordable Utilities\""Our current research shows, like that of CU, energy from a coal plant is the best option for our rural electric cooperative members.""\James Jura, CEO and general manager of Associated Electric Cooperative, Inc.\Only online ...A Hear the debate: Listen to excerpts from the Editorial Board's questioning of CU General Manager John Twitty and Gary Wright of Citizens for Clean Energy.How it works: Our animated graphic explains how coal-fired power plants operate and describes the benefits and costs of alternative energy sources.Documents: Read position papers by City Utilities and Ratepayers for Affordable Utilities.Learn more: Read past stories about City Utilities and the push for power options.Sound off: Debate the Southwest 2 plant in our special election forum.Click on our special section of Southwest 2 stories at News-Leader.com"
121,"From David Nicklaus' blog about St. Louis business. STLtoday.com/moundcitymoney\St. Louis County downgraded * St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley, whose 2010 campaign ads referred to him as ""Triple A Charlie,"" will have to come up with a new moniker for next year's re-election effort.\Standard & Poor's lowered the county's bond rating on Thursday from AAA to AA-plus, saying the move reflected S&P's new criteria for rating general-obligation bonds. The ratings agency announced in September that it had revised its process to make ratings more forward-looking.\The ratings change also affects some special obligation bonds issued by St. Louis County. They were lowered to AA from AA-plus.\Thursday's news release contains several positive comments about the county, mentioning its ""strong economy,"" ""strong budgetary performance"" and ""very strong liquidity."" S&P credit analyst John Kenward is quoted as saying, ""The stable outlook reflects St. Louis County's very strong management and our expectation that the rating will not change in the next two years because we believe the county will take the steps necessary to maintain its very strong budgetary flexibility and liquidity.""\AAA is the highest rating given by Standard & Poor's. According to the firm's ratings guide, it means the issuer has ""extremely strong capacity to meet its financial commitments."" Ratings in the AA range reflect ""a very strong capacity"" to meet financial commitments. The ratings guide adds that AA entities ""differ from the highest-rated obligors only to a very small degree."" (11.08)\In the middle * Pension costs are a big reason why Detroit is in bankruptcy, and they're a topic of debate in cities from Jacksonville to Tulsa to Chicago. In St. Louis, Mayor Francis Slay pushed for, and seems to have won, a reduction in firefighter benefits.\Which cities truly face a pension crisis? The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College has crunched the numbers to make a comparison, albeit an imperfect one. It finds that Little Rock, Ark., has the highest pension burden, spending 17.6 percent of its tax revenue on retiree benefits. Chicago is close behind at 17.0 percent.\St. Louis, at 6.3 percent of tax revenue, has the 80th-highest burden and is well below the 173-city average of 7.9 percent.\The center's numbers include city pension funds, school district funds and local contributions to state-run funds. They're really more indicative of the burden on taxpayers than on a specific city or other government entity.\They also don't include pension bond payments, which is why Detroit ranks well down the list at No. 61. Detroit issued pension bonds in 2005 and 2006, reducing its pension costs but increasing interest payments. St. Louis did the same thing in 2007, issuing $143 million in bonds to help cover a pension shortfall. (11.07)\Bonfyre gets more money * Bonfyre, a St. Louis company that sets up event-related social media networks, has raised $1.7 million from a New York marketing firm and other investors.\The New York firm, MKTG, said it had used Bonfyre at a Trey Songz concert and other events. MKTG, whose shares are traded on the over-the-counter market, does event marketing, interactive marketing and trade promotion.\Bonfyre says it is generating revenue from more than 50 event partners, including Express Scripts, Amazon and Budweiser. (11.06)\A big lemon * Of all the creative policies that were tried in the aftermath of the Great Recession, Cash for Clunkers was the looniest. It was billed as good for the environment, but it scrapped thousands of usable cars, requiring a lot of metal, plastic and energy to replace them. Its main economic effects were to get people to buy cars a few months earlier than they would have done otherwise, and to drive up the price of used cars.\Two Brookings Institution scholars, Ted Gayer and Emily Parker, recently reviewed the results of Cash for Clunkers, and they conclude that the program was a lemon. Its effect on gross domestic product was negligible, they say mainly it shifted about $2 billion worth of production into the third quarter of 2009 at the expense of the next two quarters.\The program also aided taxpayers who were relatively well off the median income of rebate recipients was about $69,000.\The clunkers program was billed as being about both helping the environment and creating jobs, but Gayer and Parker say it was an expensive way of pursuing either goal. Taxpayers spent $1.4 million for each job created, far more than the cost of other stimulus programs.\By putting more fuel-efficient cars on the road, the program did cut carbon dioxide emissions (if you don't count the emissions produced in replacing all the prematurely scrapped vehicles). Gayer and Parker say a cap-and-trade program or a carbon tax could have achieved the same reduction far more cheaply, making clunker rebates ""an inefficient approach to reducing emissions.""

122,"Loriee D. Evans is a St. Louis-based writer who works in conservation and outdoors areas.\I paid my taxes this year. In return, I drove some 12,000 miles on decent highways, my cross-country flights landed safely every time and my grandma got health care when she needed it.\Missourians pay $3,238 on average to the federal government each year. In addition to supporting education initiatives, medical research and national security, that money also gets doled out to mega-companies such as Archer Daniels Midland, GE and the oil industry. Corporate lobbying machines have successfully maintained a $125 billion-a-year corporate welfare system during a time when legislative changes have almost halved the percentage of the population on traditional welfare.\Legislators cut welfare programs, such as food stamps, because they were thought to encourage dependence and reduce work incentives. If we believe that, why do we accept the assumption that handouts to corporations will make them more competitive? It's bizarre that in the name of ""economic interests"" every level of government panders to corporations, subsidizing them to pollute our air, land and water, and then turns to taxpayers to foot the cleanup bills.\Interests as diverse as the Cato Institute, Republican House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, Resources for the Future, Taxpayers for Common Sense and Citizens for Tax Justice have decried the distorting effects such subsidies have on our economy.\Additionally, Friends of the Earth, an environmental nonprofit organization, publishes an annual list of subsidies that encourage corporations to harm the environment.\In Missouri, for example, commercial navigation on the Missouri River has fallen from 3.3 million tons in 1977 to just 1.5 million tons, generating less than $20 million in economic benefits. Taxpayers, meanwhile, subsidize barge operators with the $7 million a year that the Corps of Engineers spends for the benefit of navigation, funds that could have gone to recreation or flood control. While less than one-tenth of 1 percent of corn grown along the Missouri actually floats the river, the channelized waterway has lost more than 90 percent of its wetlands and sandbars, dramatically increasing flood losses downstream. The barges get the river, and we got the floods of 1993.\I used to live in California's arid Central Valley. It stops raining around April and not a drop comes down again until September or October. Would you believe they grow rice out there? California is the nation's second biggest rice producer. All this is possible thanks to the public's generosity with limited water supplies. Although turn of the century water laws were enacted to help small family farmers get started out west, from 1993 to 1997 taxpayers gave away some $5 billion worth of water supplies to ""agribusinesses the size of cities,"" according to Time.\So while thirsty Los Angeles spends billions to siphon off rivers and lakes for its burgeoning water needs, taxpayers give billions to corporate farms so they can grow water-intensive crops on dry, arid land.\Not surprisingly, the fossil fuels industry is also on the dole. Taxpayers shifted $1.02 billion to independent oil and gas producers in 1997 via the Percentage Depletion Tax Provision, according to Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan natural resources research institute. These subsidies encourage air pollution.\For example, we don't consider our personal contribution to a billion-dollar petroleum subsidy when we pour cheap gas into our SUVs. But the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a Minnesota nonprofit, has estimated that gasoline receives subsidies of between $.21 and $1.34 a gallon. That's what we pay in addition to the price at the pump; the more you consider hard-to-quantify health and environmental costs, like respiratory problems on heavy smog days, the higher the subsidy.\Then the petroleum industry expects taxpayers to help pay for oil spills, defense of its overseas interests and even its taxes.\A recent issue of E The Environment Magazine tackled ""green taxes."" The authors suggest shifting the tax burden away from middle- income families toward levies aimed directly at environmentally damaging activities - the polluters-pay principle. Energy companies might pay a carbon tax per ton of emissions from the greenhouse gases they produce, while dirty industries would pay directly for pollutants that spew forth from incinerators.\Corporate welfare and tax reform are not sexy topics, and politicians view both as a quick way to dry up campaign coffers. But if they framed corporate welfare reform as a major, broad tax cut to middle America, then voting taxpayers would support them come election time.\If it bugs you that a chunk of your IRS check is headed toward $125 billion in corporate welfare payments, tell your legislators that you want that money transformed into a tax cut. And then hope that policymakers are willing to put the American public's well-being above corporate welfare."
123," Before Cheryl Marcum moved back to Missouri from the suburbs of Washington, she and her husband spent years studying ways to make their southwest Missouri home among the state's most energy efficient.\ Along with soy-foam insulation, Energy Star appliances and other design elements meant to minimize energy use, their 3,700-square- foot house has solar panels on the roof to help run the dishwasher, computer and other appliances. On sunny days, the couple often have a little extra electricity to put back on the grid.\ By generating their own electricity, the Marcums are among a small but growing number of Missourians choosing to offset their energy consumption with small-scale renewable power systems to help lessen the nation's dependence on coal, oil and natural gas and cut emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas linked to global warming.\ But producing power is one thing; selling it is another. Marcum and others with solar- and wind-power systems in Missouri say they've had a difficult time reaching terms with utilities that would enable them to put excess generation back on the grid.\ ""We thought we knew exactly what we needed to do and then everything fell apart,"" she said. ""This has taken seven months, countless telephone calls, countless e-mails. It's got to be easier.""\ Missouri enacted a law in 2002 establishing standards for customers who want to connect to the grid. But renewable-energy advocates, environmentalists and legislators say the state's rules are too cumbersome and fall short of their intended goals.\ ""It's a very convoluted process that varies from utility to utility,"" said state Rep. Jason Holsman, D-Kansas City. Complaints about the current process prompted Holsman to sponsor the Easy Connection Act, which would make it simpler for homeowners and businesses to connect to the grid. The Illinois Legislature is considering a similar measure, sponsored by Rep. Naomi Jakobsson, D- Champaign.\ The bills have strong support from environmentalists because Missouri and Illinois are among just nine states without true ""net metering"" standards, according to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, which tracks renewable-energy policies and incentives.\ ""Forty-one states have already done it and it's shown to be successful, so it's the low-hanging fruit,"" said Erin Noble, outreach and development director for the Missouri Coalition for the Environment.\ The utility industry in Missouri doesn't oppose net metering but wants to make sure the state is careful to require customers pushing electricity back onto the grid to meet certain standards, said Chuck Caisley, president of the Missouri Energy Development Association, the trade group representing investor-owned utilities.\ ""Our biggest concern is that the system is safe and reliable,"" Caisley said.\ Illinois gets just 1.9 percent of its electricity from renewable sources such as wind and sun. In Missouri, it's just a fraction of 1 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the Energy Department.\ In fact, Missouri had only two residential net metering customers in 2005, the most recent data available. By contrast, California had more than 17,000. Other leading states include New Jersey, Oregon and Montana, though the numbers of customers selling power back to utilities in those states can be measured by the hundreds, not thousands.\ Cost is the biggest reason that development of small-scale renewable energy systems has been so limited, said Warren Wood, head of utility operations for the Missouri Public Service Commission staff.\ A two- to three-kilowatt solar power system costs $15,000 to $30,000. While there's a $2,000 federal tax credit available to help defray the cost, there are no state tax incentives available in Missouri, and electricity rates in the state are lower than in many others, such as California, Texas and Northeast states.\ Tony Loman of Kirkwood installed a one-kilowatt solar power system in his home last July. Like Marcum, he has yet to reach an agreement to sell excess power back to the municipal electric supplier, but he hopes to do so soon.\ Loman, a sociologist, decided to install solar panels not to make money, but because he has had a long-standing interest in the environment, and he has become increasingly concerned about the direction of the nation's energy policy.\ ""I feel like this is the wave of the future,"" he said. ""I also feel a social responsibility to push this kind of thing.""\ Ditto for Gary Steps, a retired IBM engineer who now runs an energy consulting business.\ While solar systems like his are out of reach for many homeowners, the economics are changing, he said. Prices for coal and natural gas have been climbing in recent years and costs of solar and wind-power systems are dropping as technologies advance and manufacturers benefit from economies of scale.\ Sitting at the kitchen table of his home in Webster Groves, Steps can monitor a computer system that tracks how much electricity his 2.1-kilowatt solar system is generating (205 kilowatts since March 1); how much backup power is stored by the battery system in his basement (12.4 hours); and how much carbon dioxide he has prevented from being vented into the atmosphere by generating some of his own electricity (335.5 pounds).\ Steps thinks a carbon tax or other similar regulation being considered by Congress could further raise prices for power from coal-fired power plants and make solar and wind-power systems more feasible for consumers.\ Steps, in fact, said he is ready to ""double down"" on his solar investment if the economics improve. ""If that were to happen next year, you'd see me put another set of panels up,"" he said.\ ---\ NET METERING LEADERS\ State Number of participants\ California 17,427\ New Jersey 604\ Wisconsin 240\ Minnesota 193\ Nevada 188\ Texas 163\ Vermont 164\ SOURCE: Energy Information Administration\ ---\ STLtoday.com/links\ Read the electric energy bill.\ Credit: Jeffrey Tomich; ST.

124,"Need to be accurate\about costs of energy sources\Regarding the editorial "" 'Extremely likely' "" (Sept. 30):\The real problem in energy is that fuel sources are not accurately priced, and what we think are cheap coal and natural gas are really quite costly. The dollar value of the damage they both do is seen in negative impacts on the environment and, more importantly, in health effects. While natural gas is a bit better for the environment than coal, it is not enough different to matter.\We need future regulations that will add in those costs for using fossil fuels, either through a carbon tax or some other means. Without capturing the real price of energy sources, we cannot make wise decisions. We need that to level the playing field for alternatives like wind, solar and nuclear energy.\William H. Miller * Columbia, Mo.\Professor emeritus, Missouri University Research Reactor\Proposed ban on adults\in city playgrounds is a bad idea\Regarding ""Adults could be banned from city playgrounds"" (Oct. 5):\This is yet another example of the egregious laws that get enacted for issues in which individuals and the cities need to take greater responsibility. Banning all adults from all city playgrounds unless accompanied by a child? And just because New York City does it is a reason we should consider doing it, too? Is it legal to ban adults from playgrounds within a park in a city where they pay taxes? Are there no other solutions?\I could see, at the extreme, if no other solutions could be found, designating a few playgrounds where that might be a possibility. But to do it all over, and fining people who might stray into the area with a dog, or whatever? Possible solutions to this problem include: working with City Hall to get more police protection during certain times of each day, organizing a neighborhood watch, buying your own playground equipment for your backyard and having play dates, etc.\Then there is the whole issue of who will pay for all this. Should we just hire a few more people at City Hall to administer this? What goes on in the city is going to move west to the county. This law is a bad idea, and needs to be rethought. I am convinced that it might be in the region's best interest for the city to rejoin the county. But, when cities try to legislate behavior, and punish the general public instead of taking precise actions to fix the problem, that makes people wary.\Jennifer Jeffrey * St. Louis County\Veterans deserve to visit\memorial and be honored\I'd like to see our nonveteran president tell those Honor Flight veterans arriving in Washington that they are not allowed to visit the memorials we erected to honor them.\Art Young * Webster Groves\Representatives' assertions\of patriotism ring hollow\As the son of a decorated World War II veteran, now deceased, and as one who has visited the memorial to him and his comrades, I can well understand the spiritual draw of that site to vets who, despite their frailty, traveled from Texas during the government shutdown.\Their determination in removing the barricades erected because of the shutdown might be excusable. This, in spite of their having fought to defend our system of checks and balances. However, what is entirely inexcusable and disgusting is their being aided and abetted by some of the very representatives of the people who instigated the shutdown. Their assertions of patriotism ring hollow and mock the memory of my father.\Rabbi Scott Saulson * Creve Coeur\Affordable Care Act affects only\a small percentage of the public\I simply refuse to believe that the letters published on Saturday were representative of the public's opinion on the Obamacare issue. I do believe that the president seriously erred by not calling the program its real name and allowing others to name it after him, when there is a core of the public who see it as serious and think he named it after himself.\There is an underlying error in the most basic analysis of the Affordable Care Act, which is primarily believing that it effects everyone. In truth, only about 17 percent of the general public, those who do not already have private insurance, employment-related group insurance and/or Medicare, are affected directly.\If you already have such insurance, nothing will change for you. Even a basic major medical plan, which covers only hospital expenses or has a huge deductible before paying anything, is still OK. Unfortunately, may of the newly covered people have no idea what a co-pay or a deductible is. More education was needed and again, this is the failure of Health and Human Services and it has been made worse by the tea party Republicans who use this to scare people.\The shutdown is wrong because there are irrefutable facts in play. The ACA is a law. It was already passed by Congress. It was affirmed by the Supreme Court. If Congress now doesn't like it, pass a reform or an amendment to it. But don't close down essential services like the kid who takes his ball home and pouts.\Joseph M. Reichert * Belleville\Congress should put aside\differences for country's good\The front page of Monday's Post-Dispatch proclaims the story that, due to the government shutdown, the Ozark National Scenic Riverways is closed. The Jacks Fork, Current and other rivers like the Meramec are now closed to fishing, canoeing, swimming, etc. What's next, closing national highways?\Congress needs to stop acting like 2-year-olds and put aside their differences for the good of the country. If this childishness continues, our country will die. Revolution could occur like what is going on in Egypt.\Eugene Hanneke * Ellisville\Dump tea party members\into Boston Harbor\I would predict if a national poll of U.S. voters were to be taken today, a majority of them would vote summarily to dump the obstructionist tea party members of the House of Representatives into Boston Harbor. As long as we are in a dumping mood, we could also add (1) the junior senator from Texas, Ted Cruz, whom fellow Republican Sen. John McCain has aptly dubbed a wacko bird; (2) Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who has repeatedly stuck his nose in Missouri business, and (3) Grover Norquist, the lobbyist, whose main mission is to sign up members of Congress to pledge never to raise taxes. Do you have other candidates worthy for consideration?\Dr. John C. Herweg * Ballwin\Congresswoman disregards\party's support for abortion\Dana Milbank's column (""A little lifeboat for a big ship"", Oct. 4) featured Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee displaying empty chairs to represent children potentially cut from Head Start, noting each of them could have held ""the next astronaut"" or ""a captain in the United States military."" Too bad the congresswoman hasn't offered the exact same display regarding her party's support for abortion. Maybe she just couldn't find enough chairs.\Bryan Kirchoff * St. Louis\Aide should have had\conceal-carry permit revoked\Although I was one who signed a petition for the aide to Missouri House Speaker Tim Jones to resign after he left a loaded gun in the restroom, I think there was a much better consequence for this person.\Instead of having to resign, he should have had his conceal-carry permit revoked. A person who can't control a loaded weapon any better than this aide should not be able to carry a loaded weapon in public.\John Stopple * Kirkwood"
125,"As the nation continues to debate solutions to global warming, it's heartening to see a local project with the promise of reducing the root cause of the devastating climate change.\City Utilities deserves praise and support for its forward-thinking work in securing the funds to experiment with trying to get rid of carbon dioxide by pumping it underground.\In the scheme of things, there's little cost to local ratepayers, because CU's work will be funded by a $2.46 million federal grant obtained through U.S. Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond and contributions from five utility partners of $98,000 each. CU is also contributing that much from an ""environmental budget.""\The potential payback, however, looms large.\Many experts predict the U.S. will have to enact, in coming years, some sort of carbon tax or carbon market that will create a value for the ability to reduce emissions. If CU can prove that emissions can be sent into Greene County rock and underground saltwater to be absorbed there through natural chemical interactions, the utility will be ahead of the game -- both ecologically and financially.\The ""carbon sequestration"" project is the first of its kind trying to send the emissions for storage into saltwater at relatively shallow rock formations. It could allow utilities like CU to avoid sending emissions by pipelines long distances to states with deeper injection systems made possible by different geological makeup.\On Monday, the U.S. Senate is expected to start debating a bill that would create, as its key component, a system for forcing large emitters of greenhouse gases to buy the right to release a prescribed amount of the gases annually by purchasing ""allowances"" or carbon credits.\Another point of the program allows businesses that pollute to trade credits on the open market, perhaps buying more to meet an emissions standard one year and selling them another, when the business retrofits its operations to reduce gases.\Proponents of the bill, S. 2191, including the nonprofit advocacy group Environmental Defense, also support the underground storage idea that CU will be trying.\According to Environmental Defense spokesman Tony Kreindler, it's one of the few areas where the advocates agree with Bond. The senator does not support S. 2191 because he says it comes with too high a potential cost to utility customers.\With that aside, the fact that an experiment could create a point of consensus for opponents in the carbon market debate gives hope for progress toward resolving the much larger and more complex problem of global warming.\CU's experimental work is expected to take three years. Of course, it might fail. But, in the words of CU General Manager John Twitty, ""even if we prove we can't sequester carbon this way, it adds to our body of knowledge.""\This is a high-stakes battle -- one Illinois coal gasification attempt to remove carbon dioxide from emissions has failed despite having a billion dollar price tag -- and knowledge will be power.\We hope this experiment pays off. We applaud the effort in advance. We realize it is costly.\But, in this matter, the cost of doing nothing, or waiting impotently for new, pricey environmental regulations, will be much higher.\WHAT:\City Utilities is making the right move in experimenting with the underground storage of carbon dioxide.\WHY:\In addition to protecting the environment, this may save Springfield taxpayers plenty in years to come."

A political issue has reached critical mass when its natural adversaries throw in the towel.
\
That is what is happening in the United States on global warming, with President George W. Bush and much of corporate America signaling they are through disputing whether temperatures are rising enough to portend future woes.
\
Of course, even if the disputes about the existence or potential ills of climate change are abating, that doesn't mean the global warming believers will now get the laws they want or even find that candidates espousing their views win more elections. The developing consensus that it is time to deal with global warming rather than argue about its existence is likely to make it less, not more, of a salient domestic political issue.
\
It is worth remembering that when the Iron Curtain fell and the Cold Warriors claimed victory in the early 1990s, Americans elected a president, Bill Clinton, who was not one of them and was short on national security credentials to boot. That's because with the Soviet Union imploding, voters figured they could move on to other matters. They then turned to the party they were unwilling to trust with the White House when they were more worried about external threats.
\
Although the new political environment - no pun intended - doesn't necessarily mean Al Gore is going to be elected president because he has been out front on the issue, it puts the politics of global warming in new perspective
\
Bush's acknowledgment of the problem and the need to deal with it is one sign that the tide has turned on climate change. And with Democrats - who for years have campaigned against Bush and Republicans for ignoring global warming - in control of Congress, it is obvious something is likely to be done.
\
The political argument now will be about the best way to combat the problem and its effects - in other words disputes about tactics and efficacy - rather than larger, more fundamental disputes.
\
With the existence of global warming no longer an issue, it is likely the political debate will shift to what steps and what resulting economic costs are reasonable.
\
The current focus of debate will be the proposal advanced by many congressional Democrats and some Republicans for a ""carbon tax"" and an accompanying system that will allow companies to trade emissions credits. Supporters call it a free-market solution without massive government interference, but the White House has not signed on to the idea.
\
It is not hard to see the political debate about the existence of global warming translating into the age-old dispute between the parties about the wisdom of taxes and regulation. That is a much more complicated political discussion than whether the global climate is getting warmer.
\
And it is one on which the political edge is not nearly as clear.

Some members of Illinois' business community say their bottom lines will take a beating after President-elect Bill Clinton takes office Jan. 20.
\
But Clinton's call for infrastructure improvements could give a lift to the state's construction and heavy equipment industries, says Greg Baise, president of the Illinois Manufacturers Association.
\
""With more large construction projects, you've got to have bulldozers. You've got to have parts,"" Baise said.
\
The owner of an office supply firm in Springfield, Ill., says he fears increased regulation and taxation from Clinton, the outgoing Democratic governor of Arkansas.
\
""With the taxes, it's a little bit scary for the small businessman,"" said Jerome Watson of CDS Office Systems.
\
Chicago scrap metal dealer Mike Olive says having a Democrat in the White House will slow the economic recovery.
\
""I feel that Democrats historically have been pro-spending, pro-taxes and pro-unions,"" said Olive, the co-owner of Midwest Industrial Metals Co. ""I don't believe that's the way the economy has to be stimulated.""
\
Olive calls Clinton ""a bright young fellow"" who nevertheless may lack the answer for reducing unemployment.
\
""If they create jobs, that's wonderful. They just haven't said how they're going to do it,"" he said.
\
But one economist says Illinois stands to get a payback, after traditionally handing over more federal tax money than it has received.
\
""Basically in the '80s, the Midwest was financing the coasts,"" said Diane Swonk, Midwest economist for First Chicago Corp. ""In the '90s you'll see a reversal of that trend.""
\
Swonk says the president-elect's plan for deeper defense cuts could translate into more transportation funds for the Midwest. The money could go toward a third Chicago-area airport, highway improvements or a high-speed rail system.
\
But Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore have caused anxiety with their support of measures such as the family-leave bill vetoed this year by President George Bush.
\
And manufacturers and exporters are wary of Clinton's less-than-total endorsement of the North American Free Trade Agreement, said Baise, a former Illinois campaign director for former President Ronald Reagan.
\
""Illinois is very dependent on exports. Large businesses will be watching very closely how Governor Clinton proceeds on NAFTA,"" he said.
\
Gore's zeal for cleaning the environment has business executives steaming, says Terry Barnich of the Illinois Commerce Commission.
\
Barnich calculated that a carbon tax like the one endorsed by Gore and the European Community would raise Illinois electric bills by more than 15 percent. That could spell trouble for manufacturers with million-dollar yearly electric costs, he added.
\
Although Illinois now will be represented by two strongly pro-labor Democrats in the U.S. Senate - Paul Simon and Senator-elect Carol Moseley Braun - some think business won't necessarily lose out.
\

128,"News-Leader\Rep. Roy Blunt's Senate campaign estimates liberal special interest groups have spent more than $500,000 in negative advertising attacking his record -- and it's not even 2010 yet.\The Missouri Republican Party says it spent about $10,000 for an online advertisement linking Secretary of State Robin Carnahan to the embattled community-organizing group ACORN.\Blunt, R-Springfield, and Carnahan, a Democrat, will be the likely contenders next year in the race to succeed Kit Bond in the U.S. Senate.\The most recent television ad from the League of Conservation Voters tying Blunt to Big Oil began airing in the Springfield market Thursday. It will air through Nov. 15 on every broadcast TV station in the region, according to Mike Palamuso, spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters.\This is the environmental advocacy group's third TV ad against Blunt since April. LCV is using the same ad nationwide, but changing the script for particular members of Congress it's targeting who voted against the American Clean Energy and Security Act -- better known as the cap-and-trade legislation.\Blunt says he's against the bill because it places a new tax on carbon dioxide emissions, causing electricity rates to skyrocket. The congressman says the carbon tax adversely harms states like Missouri, which gets nearly 85 percent of its electricity from coal-fired power plants.\Palamuso said Blunt's vote against the legislation is evidence he's in the pocket of Big Oil companies, which are lobbying against the bill because it requires them to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at refineries, likely increasing the price of gasoline.\The ad features a politician -- you can't see his face -- at an event going around the room shaking hands. As the politician shakes hands and slaps backs, he leaves oil on everyone he touches. ""There's a stain on Congressman Blunt's record,"" the announcer says. ""Big Oil and energy interests gave him over $1 million in campaign cash.""\By voting against the bill, the announcer says Blunt voted ""no"" to new green energy jobs, less carbon pollution and less dependence on foreign oil. ""Congressman Blunt, you're supposed to stand up to Big Oil, not turn your back on Missouri. Clean up your act,"" the announcer says in the TV ad as the politician leaves oil-drenched footprints across a gym floor.\Campaign finance records show Blunt has taken $1,012,398 from energy and natural resources interests since 1996, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\Since launching her campaign earlier this year, Carnahan has accepted $21,650 in contributions from oil industry lobbyists and their families, records show. That does not include money Carnahan has taken from other energy sector special interests, such as alternative-energy advocates.\The Blunt campaign says negative attack advertising from special interest groups is a sign of things to come next year in what's shaping up to be one of the closest watched Senate races in 2010.\""We would expect that left-wing groups like LCV, Pro-Vote, which represents ACORN and other liberal groups, to spend millions in false and negative attack ads in Missouri,"" Blunt spokes-man Rich Chrismer said.\Blunt has said the energy tax being pursued by Democrats in Congress would raise the price of everything because of increased electricity rates.\""That's why he voted against the energy tax that Robin Carnahan supports because it would cause Missourians' home energy prices to skyrocket and destroy jobs our families need,"" Chrismer said in a statement.\For her part, Carnahan has not taken a definitive stance on the legislation, in part because she's not a current member of Congress and won't get to vote on it.\""Robin has been clear when it comes to energy policy that she believes the energy status quo is hurting our economy, undermining our national security and damaging our environment -- so, despite what the entrenched corporate special interests and Washington insiders may say -- we need change,"" Carnahan spokesman Linden Zakula said in a statement.\Zakula said Carnahan favors ""a commonsense solution to promote alternative energy including wind, solar, and nuclear power to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, create jobs and curb pollution -- without sticking consumers, small businesses or family farms with the bill in these tough economic times.""\Chad Livengood covers state government and politics for the News-Leader.

129,"As oil continues to gush from an out-of-control well on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico, the Senate is preparing for a crucial vote on America's energy future.\At issue is a resolution by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, that would prevent the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions.\Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, is expected to play a key role in today's vote.\She is a strong supporter of President Barack Obama, whose administration would be rebuked by the resolution.\However, Ms. McCaskill always has been moderate on climate change - recognizing its reality but urging an approach that doesn't unnecessarily penalize Missouri industries and workers.\Ms. McCaskill was one of four Democrats who had cosponsored a separate measure that would impose a two-year ""time out"" before the EPA could enact rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, refineries and factories.\But Ms. Murkowski's resolution goes much farther. Instead of asking for a time out, it declares EPA regulation of carbon dioxide emissions to be out of bounds.\That would hamstring the nation's ability to address climate change and lock in our preference for dirty, dangerous energy sources at a time when China and other nations are making substantial investments in clean technology. Even Abu Dhabi is building what it calls the world's largest concentrated solar power plant and the first of its kind in the Middle East.\The BP oil disaster is a timely reminder that the cost of America's dependence on fossil fuels goes well beyond what we pay at the pump. It also includes damage to the environment from drilling and refining oil, as well as from the greenhouse gases released when it is burned.\Just last month, the National Academies of Science released a trio of authoritative reports on global warming.\""A strong, credible body of scientific evidence shows that climate change is occurring, is caused largely by human activities and poses significant risks for a broad range of human and natural systems,"" one of the reports reads.\Ms. Murkowski and her supporters cloak their resolution in a reasonable-sounding argument. Congress, not an administrative agency like the EPA, should set the nation's energy policy and set a strategy for mitigating climate change.\That's true, a point we've previously made in this space. The trouble is that after a decade of trying, Congress has yet to come to grips with the issue. And while a small group of denialists holds the issue hostage, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide continue to rise and the climate continues to warm.\Ms. Murkowski's resolution began its life as an amendment to another piece of legislation. The oil industry helped write it. When, in an effort to win support from moderate Democrats like Ms. McCaskill, Ms. Murkowski's office held a briefing on her proposal last September, the meeting was led by a pair of energy industry lobbyists.\Given what's played out in the Gulf of Mexico over the past 50 days - the disaster spawned by reckless drilling and compounded by dissembling and bungling on the part of BP - it's hard to believe that any politician would follow the oil industry's lead.\If the Senate is serious about addressing climate change, it only has to take up a cap-and-trade bill that already has passed in the House. Failing that, it can adopt an alternative involving a direct carbon tax.\Ms. McCaskill can and should play an important role in deciding the fate of Ms. Murkowski's industry-friendly bill: She should vote against it."

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil - European nations left the United States in isolation at the Earth Summit on Tuesday, presenting a united front on the session's two major treaties and clashing directly with U.S. policy.
\
Britain became the last major European nation to say it would sign the biodiversity treaty, an agreement to protect plants, animals and natural resources.
\
And the 12 countries of the European Community said they would issue a supplementary declaration calling for speedy action to limit gases believed to increase global warming.
\
The declaration says the European nations ""welcome the commitment"" to work toward reducing carbon dioxide emissions to levels that existed in 1990 by 2000 - a target the United States had managed to strip from the main global warming convention.
\
The United States has agreed to sign the pact on global warming.
\
But it has refused to sign the treaty on biological diversity, fearing harm to its biotechnology industry. Among industrialized nations, only Japan remains undecided.
\
Japan has said it is studying the treaty with a view to signing it.
\
Speaking at a news briefing, Michael Howard, Britain's secretary of state for the environment, announced his country's decision, saying Prime Minister John Major would sign the treaty Friday.
\
Howard said Britain had held off making a decision based on concern over financing provisions in the treaty. But, he said, Britain had found a way of overcoming the difficulties.
\
In earlier negotiations on the global warming treaty, the United States had fought hard to include other greenhouse gases in addition to carbon dioxide and to include the European proposal as only a general goal. The United States did so under pressure from industry lobbyists and concern about the effect of strict limits on its economy.
\
Some scientists fear that emissions of carbon dioxide and methane are accumulating in the upper atmosphere, helping to raise the Earth's temperature by trapping heat.
\
European Community chief delegate Laurens Jan Brinkhorst denied that Tuesday's move was an attempt to snub Washington. ""We're not talking about a confrontation with the United States,"" he said. In Washington on Tuesday evening, a U.S. official said that the United States would propose a separate plan to encourage research on the world's biological stocks.
\
The administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described the effort as ""kind of an inventory initiative, a research and inventory initiative"" under which nations will map and assess their biological resources.
\
The initiative would ""take the first step on biodiversity, which we think is critical,"" the official said. More details were unavailable.
\
Summit negotiations are trying to complete their work by today so that the final proposals can be distributed before heads of state meet in Rio on Friday and Saturday.
\
Forest Report
\
A U.N. study made public Tuesday said destruction of the world's tropical forests increased by 50 percent during the past decade. Most of the acreage being lost is in Central and South America, it says.
\
The report, by the U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization, says 41 million acres of forest are being destroyed each year, compared with about 27.9 million acres destroyed in 1980. About 70 percent of that is tropical forest, it says.
\
It says the world has 12.25 billion acres of forests, but the amount of forest land destroyed annually surpasses the amount that is replanted.
\
OPEC Opposition
\
Oil producers delivered a counterblast to the West at the Earth Summit on Tuesday, attacking European Community proposals for a carbon tax to cut fossil fuel consumption and threatening OPEC retaliation if it went ahead.
\
Subroto, secretary-general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, urged delegates in a speech to wait for proper scientific evidence before making decisions that could hurt oil exporters. He said all environmental measures should be compatible with continued economic growth.
\
Third World oil producers have been alarmed by some of the conference proposals on cutting air pollution. Saudi Arabia has been pressing to tone down references to the environmental consequences of burning fossil fuels.

131,"A-B misses chance to show\hometown dedication\It looks like Anheuser-Busch may choose to be one of many.\Countless brands are created or developed in New York City, so I understand the impulse to move Anheuser-Busch's sales and marketing operations from St. Louis. However, the title ""The King of Beers"" wasn't given. It was a St. Louis beer legend that became real when the U.S. embraced it.\A-B is facing innumerable craft beer competitors, the hometown pride of each small city across the country. The decision to ditch the hometown is a flawed business strategy.\Admirable companies make great products while retaining corporate values. Giving up on St. Louis' creative power is abandoning the chance to demonstrate authenticity and hometown dedication, all to be just another New York company.\International headquarters may change, but the most important component of a successful company is staying relevant to the cultural conversation occurring at any given moment.\Since the death of Michael Brown in early August, St. Louis has been the subject of a very controversial and important national conversation about race. We now have the opportunity to lead the country to develop solutions which can improve lives and impact history. While the sheer magnitude of these topics would never be appropriate for a beer commercial, picking a new city for A-B's U.S. Commercial Strategy office is short-sighted. A-B leaves behind a legendary history as well as the chance to demonstrate commitment to progress.\Join the crowd; miss a defining opportunity right here at home.\Patty Bloom * St. Louis\We won't halt emissions\until we put a price on carbon\I strongly agree with the editorial ""Sacrifice = Bad politics"" (Dec. 10) on government inaction on global warming and I especially agree with the statement ""Nations that were serious about mitigating global warming would have slapped a big tax on carbon and used the proceeds to arm themselves against the worst effects of global warming.""\The excellent book ""The Climate Casino"" by William Nordhaus advocates such a tax as have people like Paul Krugman and Tom Friedman. One problem is that for whatever weird reason, which I don't understand, very few of the leading environmental organizations have come out to advocate such a tax. Not the Missouri Coalition for the Environment. Not the Sierra Club (of which I'm a member). Not the Audubon Society. Not even the Natural Resources Defense Council. In fact, the only environmental organization that does advocate such a tax is the Citizens Climate Lobby (of which I'm also a supporter.)\Why is this? It beats me. All of these organizations are campaigning to support the EPA's rules on power plant carbon emissions, and that is a very good thing. But we are really not going to halt emissions until we put a price on carbon. And until those of us who really care about this problem come to understand that basic fact, I don't think we are going to solve this very serious problem.\I'm confident it will happen eventually as it will become increasingly apparent that the current approaches really are not as effective as they need to be. But I guess we are just not there yet. Things will have to get worse climate-wise before we take that action. And more of the global warming skeptics, who are mostly older conservative white males, are going to have to die off from age-related diseases before the situation really changes. Even younger Republicans understand the need to take action.\A carbon tax is a market-based solution that will provide the proper incentives to all of us to make decisions with as opposed to a regulatory approach such as the Obama and EPA's rules.\Jim Rhodes * Glendale\Reinforce message that\no one is above the law\The message I hear from all the demonstrations is that no one is above the law: not police, not Congress, not priests, not celebrities.

132,"For the 4,400 residents of Tuscola, Ill., anticipation this holiday season goes beyond the annual Yule log lighting ceremony and Santa Chase 5k race.\The city, 150 miles northeast of St. Louis, is among four sites bidding for a $1.75 billion experimental coal-fueled power plant, called FutureGen, that will also produce hydrogen and emit virtually no pollution. Other finalists are Mattoon, 25 miles south of Tuscola on Interstate 57, and the Texas cities of Odessa and Jewett.\A winner will be announced Tuesday by the FutureGen Industrial Alliance, a consortium of a dozen of the world's largest energy and mining companies, including St. Louis-based Peabody Energy Corp., that's developing the project with the U.S. Energy Department.\To the cities bidding for the project, there is a lot riding on the decision, including 150 full-time jobs, 1,300 construction jobs and the cach of being the home of ""the world's cleanest coal-fueled power plant."" Analysts, environmentalists and energy executives say there's more at stake.\Coal meets a fourth of the world's energy needs and use is projected to grow 73 percent by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. Meanwhile, scientists are urging drastic cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas released when coal and other fossil fuels are burned. Otherwise, they warn of dire consequences from the continued warming of the earth's atmosphere, such as melting ice sheets and rising sea levels.\Many energy and environmental experts say weaning the United States off coal isn't a realistic option, nor is retrofitting 500 existing power plants, which are 35 years old on average. So despite the costs and technical challenges of doing so, making coal cleaner must be a priority.\""That's why FutureGen is so critical to closing the gap between what society wants industry to do and what technology is able to do,"" said Michael J. Mudd, head of the FutureGen Alliance and an executive at Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power Co.\Others are more blunt in their assessment, such as John Thompson of the Boston-based Clean Air Task Force, an environmental advocacy group. ""There's a disconnect from where we are today and where we need to be,"" said Thompson, who works in Carbondale. ""By mid-century, we need to have all plants capturing CO2 and we have zero plants doing it right now.""\The Energy Department conceived FutureGen in February 2003 as a way to advance so-called clean coal technology, and will contribute more than $1 billion for the project with remaining costs shared among members of the FutureGen Alliance. \States bidding for the project are pitching in, too. The Illinois General Assembly and Gov. Rod Blagojevich agreed to offer $80 million in tax breaks, grants and low-interest loans to win the project - a lot, but just a fraction of the $981 million being dangled by Texas.\FutureGen is expected to begin operation in the fall of 2012. The plant will be able to produce 275 megawatts of electricity. That's just a fraction of the generation capacity of Peabody's 1,600-megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus in southwest Illinois despite costing more than three times as much on a per-kilowatt basis. \For now, however, the power delivered to the grid from FutureGen is a fringe benefit. The real goal is to prove the feasibility of producing electricity from coal with near-zero emissions in hopes that it can jump-start similar projects on a larger scale in the U.S. and around the world. \""FutureGen is an opportunity to keep trying to achieve the Holy Grail,"" said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago. ""That is, being able to use the U.S.'s enormous coal reserves in a way that is clean and protects the environment.""\At today's coal-fired power plants, the black rock is crushed into a fine powder and burned in boilers to generate steam and drive turbines that produce electricity. At FutureGen, coal will be converted to a synthetic gas so pollutants can be stripped out before combustion. And plans call for most of the carbon dioxide, an invisible, odorless gas, to be captured, compressed into a liquid and injected deep underground instead of being vented into the air - a critical technology that's yet to be tested on a large scale.\While Tuscola and Mattoon economic development officials boast all key criteria for winning the power plant - ample water supplies and good access to highways, railroads and transmission lines - it's a layer of porous rock thousands of feet below the cities that enabled them to make the cut as FutureGen finalists.\For several years, geologists have been studying an underground formation called the Mount Simon Sandstone to evaluate its potential for storing billions of tons of carbon dioxide. The rock layer covers thousands of square miles. It is 400- to 1,000 feet thick and covered by layers of shale that are considered a good seal to keep the fluid from seeping to the surface, said Robert J. Finley, director of the Earth and Energy Resources Center at the Illinois State Geological Society.\Governments must establish the necessary legal and regulatory framework to enable it to happen on a commercial scale. For FutureGen, the states of Illinois and Texas have agreed to accept any liabilities from carbon dioxide stored in the ground. And for all of the data, modeling and other tests that suggest carbon sequestration can work, it still must be proven. \""We need that demonstrated, both for the technical knowledge to be gained but also to demonstrate to the capital markets that it can be done in an economic and effective way so there can be more of these plants,"" Finley said. ""This needs to be the vanguard.""\A report this spring by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology makes obvious the enormity of the challenge: If 60 percent of the 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide produced annually by the nation's 500 coal-fired power plants was captured and buried as a liquid, the volume would almost equal the nation's total daily oil consumption of 20 million barrels. Then there's the rest of the world, including China, where the equivalent of a new coal power plant a week is being built. \Then there's cost. Even backers of ""clean coal"" acknowledge that no generator or electric utility will voluntarily pay the extra millions of dollars to capture and store carbon dioxide. And even if a so-called carbon tax is established, the price assigned to emissions would have to be significant enough (at least $25 a ton, according to the MIT report) to make it economically worthwhile.\""Nothing serious is going to happen absent a strong CO2 regulation program,"" said Thompson of the Clean Air Task Force. ""No one is going to voluntarily agree to pump money underground.""\Credit: Jeffrey Tomich; ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH"
133,"Tom Carnahan, son of the late Gov. Mel Carnahan and former Sen. Jean Carnahan, could be called a green visionary and entrepreneur. The company he founded converts the prevailing winds of northwest Missouri into dollars with minimal impact on the environment. The little town of Rock Port is served by four wind turbines and is independent of the local power grid. Excess electricity is sold to a local electric cooperative. We spoke in Carnahan's corner office on the mostly empty second floor in a rehabbed brick building on Washington Avenue downtown.\This is an impressive office for a start-up company.\I started this in 2005. I wanted to see if I could be the developer of Missouri's first wind project. We pulled the partners together. We got the community and the landowners; and the rural electric co-ops came on board. We got bipartisan support from legislators in the area.\This was your idea?\It was solely my idea. I quit practicing law and was very excited about renewable energy. It didn't make any sense that there were wind farms in Iowa and Kansas and Oklahoma and Illinois and none in Missouri. So I went about trying to figure how to get that done. Everyone was cooperative. The farmers were a little skeptical at first, and I had to ask them to take a leap of faith with me because it had never been done in Missouri before. If I could pull this together, I needed them to tell me I could use their property.\Did your family name help?\I think it did. I don't think they did it because of my family name, but they knew where to find me.\What is your total megawatts?We have, in Missouri, right at 160 megawatts. Our first project was 57 megawatts. The next two were 50, and the Rock Port one was five.\Are other companies getting into this?We have competitors. Luckily, our company was profitable from the first year because we were able to rapidly get projects done. I was able to get profits and put them back into the company to hire new people.\About a year ago, it became clear that if we were going to be a top-tier wind developer, we were going to need a larger balance sheet. I went looking for the right partner. In April, we closed a $150 million equity investment in Wind Capital Group. It's a Dublin-based company. \Isn't $150 million pretty small?\It's all relative. That's enough for us to grow over the next couple of years and purchase the equipment we need to do these projects. Wind turbines are a couple million dollars apiece. That doesn't include construction costs.\Is your company privately held?\That's correct. As we look where we're going to be two to three years from now, we're constantly running different scenarios. We'll look at public markets from time to time.\Where are the turbines made?\We have Suzlon (Wind Energy) turbines. They build the turbines in India, and now they're building the blades in Minnesota.\We've bought 150 megawatts of GE turbines to be delivered in 2010. They are all made in the United States. I want to see much of the wind energy (industry) based in the U.S., if possible.Isn't a wind turbine a simple piece of equipment? Will these stimulate a green economy?\Wind turbines are more complicated than you may expect. The blades are like a very finely designed airplane wing. There are computerized equipment, gearboxes, the generator inside. On the outside, with the monopole, they look very simple.\Are you limited to what you can do in Missouri to the northwestern part because strong winds aren't found elsewhere?\The good winds are almost completely concentrated in northwest Missouri. We wouldn't have been able to build a wind farm where we have with the technology that existed 10 years ago. Turbines are getting more efficient, and the blades are getting longer, so places that were marginal a few years ago all of a sudden make sense now.\Can you imagine wind farms across the northern tier of counties?Absolutely. It's not just where you can get wind. You could have the best wind regimes on earth, but if you don't have any transmission lines, if you can't move the electricity from the windy spots to the demand centers in urban areas, you're not going to have wind farms there. One good thing about northwest Missouri is there is a lot of transmission, so it's unique.Do you plan to go into other renewables?It's something I've grappled with. Are we a wind-energy company, or are we a renewable-energy company? I decided we are a wind-energy company, and that we were going to do that better than anyone. We are going to focus on developing wind-energy projects with an emphasis on the midwestern U.S.\Are there risks with cultural and political differences?\I actually relish that. Challenges in business and in life, for that matter, present opportunities. So if there's a challenge in doing a job in Brazil, that might just mean an opportunity for us if our competitors don't want to go there.\All the developers in 2005 said you couldn't do a project in the state of Missouri. It was common knowledge that wind energy wouldn't work here. In that challenge, I found an opportunity and was able to start a business.\Can you saturate the market geographically?\I don't think that's going to happen any time soon. The midwestern U.S. is a very, very big area. The immediate challenge is saturating the transmission capacity that's available. That's happening right now. There are not enough power lines to move energy safely and effectively.\What do you pay landowners?\About $5,000 per turbine per year. We have some farmers that have five or six of them on their property. It's not taking any land out of production, so they like it.\In addition, we believe in paying our fair share of property taxes. That is good business. The community as a whole sees the benefit, not just the farmers involved. \You're not looking to dodge taxes?\No. It's difficult. As prices go up, there's a lot of pressure to cut costs. We need to do that to have competitively priced electricity. We made a decision that we are not going to seek tax abatements like some of our competitors have.\What does it cost to produce a megawatt of electricity?\I can't talk about specific projects and our power-sales agreements. We would be very competitive with energy made from natural gas right now. The important thing to remember is wind energy is inflation-proof. Once the project is built, you know what the price is going to be for 20 years.\This is a very important point. You don't have fuel-price fluctuations. You don't have to wonder what the railroad's going to charge you to move your fuel.\Even if wind is slightly higher in 2008 than its competitors, you look at the price over time. It's a flat price over 20 years, compared to a combined-cycle or a coal unit that's going to have increased costs. Even if you sprinkle in a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, it all of a sudden looks very, very good.\---\Tom CARNAHAN\Position: President and CEO, Wind Capital Group\Age: 39\Career: Staff attorney, St. Louis city counselor's office, 1995-1997; partner, Carnahan & Garvin, 1997-2005; founded Wind Capital Group, 2005\Education: Bachelor of arts, international relations, William Jewell College, 1991; juris doctor, University of Missouri at Columbia, 1995\Personal: Lives in the Central West End with his wife, Lisa; two daughters"
134,"Politicians who get rich off public service should offer payback\We hand many legislators a financial windfall. When will we mandate some return to our stressed government coffers? Focusing on the post-service earnings referred to in ""Man in a hurry"" (June 13), it's obvious that many politicians do not stay in debt from campaigns. They write, lecture and consult for pay, occasionally resulting in massive fortunes. \Public service has become a personal business for some. Their stupendous financial opportunities are possible only because we elected them to serve us. We already provide them health benefits, salaries and retirement benefits, which they control (a privilege most of us cannot imagine). They take their networking them when leaving office, an intangible financial benefit.\It is to these public servants, past and present, that we owe our outrageous national debt, with which we and future generations must cope.\While many retired politicians donate to favorite causes or have an occasional gratis function, many retain much of their post-service fortunes, living a life markedly different from the majority of their constituents, enjoying much more financial security than they and their families truly need. \Do our legislators have the courage to determine a plan whereby a designated percentage of their post-service earnings, theirs specifically because we elected them to serve our country, will return to us, the people? Campaign finance reform is one thing. We need something else as well. \Janet Gluesenkamp - Webster Groves\Parlor game\It could be a parlor game, if it weren't so ridiculous: Trying to determine which of the ""three wise monkeys"" - see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil - was most inspirational for U.S. Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Lexington, Mo., and U.S. Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond, R-Mo., last week.\On June 8, Mr. Skelton, in his refusal to hold a committee hearing on House Resolution 1283, a bill that would allow gays to serve openly in the military, stated, ""What do mommies and daddies say to their 7-year-old child?"" Maybe he's right, Missouri families, already managing conversations about war, unemployment, environmental disasters and other ""light"" subjects, couldn't possibly manage this subject, too. Apparently, ""don't ask, don't tell"" works equally well as parental advice.\The same day, Mr. Bond, who apparently missed the coverage of the little oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, found time to denounce the Environmental Protection Agency and a possible carbon tax (to reduce greenhouse emissions), claiming to speak up for Missouri farmers and small-business owners. He's probably right, too; Missourians are not capable of building a truly 21st-century economy, including cleaner energy and a smarter industrial base. Better to hold on to our way of life, regardless of the real costs.\Unable to see the urgent needs of a changing world, to hear the majorities of Americans, soldiers and civilians, calling for a change to an unjust law or to say anything that is remotely forward-thinking, Mr. Skelton and Mr. Bond need to stop monkeying around. It's just embarrassing. \Ray Sherrock - Webster Groves\Shameful sentences\Two stories in the June 12 Post-Dispatch show the low value of life and the ridiculous sentencing in our judicial system. A drunk driver kills an innocent person and gets eight years in prison (""Drunk driver gets 8 years on crash""). A heroin dealer gets 20 years for selling to a man who overdosed and died (""Heroin provider gets 20-year sentence in fatal overdose"").\The heroin user chose to take the drug; the lady the drunk driver hit did not choose to get killed by the drunk driver. Both sentences should have been longer. Such sentences don't show a high value on life. A shame on both counts.\Ed Levy - Florissant\Vile nonsense\Jim Turner's June 12 letter representing the Sierra Club was at least good for a laugh. He complained about supposed subsidies to oil and coal production, but completely ignored that solar and wind power could not exist without massive subsidies. Let's be clear about such subsidies - they are money taken by force from taxpayers to give to solar and wind producers. Waste is not a virtue, but fantasies about wind and solar, supported by massive subsidies, are vile nonsense.\The BP disaster is part of a recent pattern. It was a failure of humans who repeatedly ignored well-thought procedures and methods to prevent such disasters, completely ignoring their moral obligations. The lack of preparedness for the spill also reflects our tendency to temper the wonderful optimism of the United States with the realization that bad things can and do happen, as happened with people who created a house of cards subject to the slightest ill wind with excessive borrowing. \The incompetence and corruption of the government agencies involved is no surprise. We have mistakenly allowed our government to grow to a bizarre size and scope, making it less and less likely that it is able to do any of the thousands of tasks it has taken on well. Again, the housing bubble is another recent example of bad and amoral decisions by people who ignored numerous safeguards and by a radically too-large government that ignored and abetted their behavior. \F. Stephen Masek - Mission Viejo, Calif.\Cleaner future\Drilling holes in the ocean floor to release oil seems too risky now that the results are in. There are about 4,000 more holes that could create a similar mishap. \Capping all of the remaining stacks or shorting out the well below water level (if possible) could give us a cleaner future. One spill has ruined and changed the Gulf of Mexico for decades to come by unleashing a river of oil.\I don't blame BP or anyone else in an attempt to create an oil reservoir for our future needs, but the environment is much more important than a fuel that can't be contained and guaranteed safe storage. Our health and life on Earth is much more important than that.\Elizabeth Keeler - Maryland Heights \Missing migrants\An inconspicuous but important impact of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is the death of small migrant birds, hummingbirds and songbirds. Millions of these beautiful and ecologically important pollinators and consumers of insects normally would summer in St. Louis and elsewhere. Many of these service providers cross the Gulf. Their pathway and timing overlap the fumes that have incapacitated humans working there.\Arriving at the contaminated area, these vulnerable travelers are in the most intense metabolic effort of their brief lives. It is unlikely that instincts and behaviors would urge them to avoid the unique threat presented by the fouled air were they able to detect it and apply sentient thought, also unlikely. The fragile migrants, in precarious circumstances, are likely to strike contaminated water before land.\Their corpses and their absence here are of little notice, although normally a few migrants are known to alight and rest on boats.\Most of the scores of species migrating across the Gulf also use overland routes. We should not anticipate their total disappearance. Area birders may report fewer of their favorite subjects, but such observations do not meet scientific criteria for reliability or accuracy.\Years ago, 10 annual censuses of breeding bird populations were conducted at Washington University's Tyson Research Center; the protection from insect larvae given forest foliage by birds was assessed by Professor Robert J. Marquis of the University of Missouri-St. Louis. These studies might serve as bases for comparisons with new data, but the causal correlation of any declines detected with the spill would prove difficult.\Richard W. Coles - Eureka"
135,"News-Leader\Carbon dioxide puts the fizz in your soda pop and snuffs flames when squirted from fire extinguishers.\But on an industrial scale, carbon dioxide is blamed for trapping heat in the atmosphere and making global warming worse.\Coal-fired power plants emit a lot of carbon dioxide, a fact that City Utilities officials hope to address through a one-of-a-kind test project at CU's coal-burning Southwest Power Station.\With the help of four research partners, CU seeks to find out if it's safe and feasible to inject large amounts of carbon dioxide from its power plant chimneys into saltwater-filled rock formations some 2,000 feet below the surface. The greenhouse gas today goes straight into the atmosphere.\If the test succeeds, CU may be able to reduce its emissions and limit the impact of a future ""carbon tax"" that nearly all environmental watchers predict Congress will enact within five years. It may also pave the way for other utilities.\""We see carbon regulations coming, and we want to get ahead of the game,"" said Gary Pendergrass, CU's manager of environmental compliance. ""We think this pilot project has a lot of merit.""\So does Missouri Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mexico.\Bond recently secured $2.5 million in the Senate's Energy and Water spending bill to help pay for the project. It still needs final approval by Congress.\CU will need to ante up $500,000 in matching funds.\The project is a collaborative effort between City Utilities, Missouri State University, University of Missouri-Rolla, Washington University in St. Louis and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.\Bruce Nilles, a Wisconsin-based Sierra Club attorney who has battled CU over air permit issues, said the utility should have found a way to deal with carbon dioxide before it broke ground on a new power plant. Southwest 2 is expected to go online in 2010.\""While we enthusiastically support research to determine whether carbon capture and storage is technically and economically feasible, CU's failure to address this issue before moving forward to build an expensive new coal plant that will emit millions of tons of carbon dioxide annually presents an extraordinary risk for CU's customers,"" Nilles said in an email response.\""CU could help to mitigate this risk by putting its new coal plant on hold until it has a viable plan to reduce its global warming emissions.""\Scientific approach\The test project is a science mission in search of answers, Pendergrass said.\""There's a lot of testing and modeling to do before we get to the injection phase,"" he said. ""It will take a year to do the test bore holes, another year for research and analysis at the universities. I think it will be 2 or 2-1/2 years before we have a final report.\""If the answers are 'no' at any point along the way, we simply stop the project.""\Currently there is no low-cost way to extract carbon dioxide out of chimney gases from a pulverized-coal plant like the ones CU operates, although an Illinois power plant is researching that kind of technology.\For its test project, CU will purchase pure carbon dioxide.\Before CU even attempts to inject the gas into an existing well at Southwest, the utility's research partners will analyze the geology below the plant.\Researchers will take core samples of rock to see how porous it is, how easily water and gas move through it and what makes up the various layers of stone.\They'll calculate the strength of the rock layers and how much carbon dioxide pressure would be needed to crack the layers.\Some of the research will focus on how carbon dioxide will behave once it's injected.\Pendergrass said the theory is that some of it will dissolve into the saltwater. Some of it would be physically trapped by the rock barriers.\And under high pressures and cold temperatures at that 2,000-foot depth some of the carbon dioxide might turn into solid crystals.\""We think all three will occur there. That's what we have to find out.""\Will gas stay down?\Perhaps most importantly, researchers will try to determine how far carbon dioxide gas pumped under high pressure will travel and whether it will stay underground.\""We gotta do the science and let the facts come to light first,"" said Pete Mulvany, chief geologist with the state Division of Geology and Land Survey.\""We do not know for certain if there's a geologic seal down there that would prevent carbon dioxide from migrating to the surface.""\Undetected cracks in the layers of rock could let the gas escape and defeat the effort to permanently lock it away from the atmosphere. Because carbon dioxide is heavier than air, a sudden venting of stored gas could also threaten human life nearby.\The venting has happened naturally near some volcanoes. In 1986, a massive carbon dioxide gas bubble belched out of a volcanic lake in Cameroon, Africa, sinking to the ground and killing 1,700 people.\There are no volcanoes near Springfield but there are thousands of wells drilled to various depths. At least three wells in Greene County are deep enough to intersect the strata where CU hopes to eventually sequester its power plant carbon dioxide.\Mulvany said the state has a ""fairly good"" record of wells - water, oil and gas, and exploratory - drilled over the years. It's important to know their location because a well that comes close to or penetrates the area where carbon dioxide would be injected and stored could serve as a conduit for the gas to escape and reach the surface.\CU plans to inject carbon dioxide into a layer of saltwater-saturated rock about 330 feet thick and 1,800 feet deep.\A 245-foot layer of denser stone lays atop of that water-filled rock, and CU believes it may be dense enough to keep the gas from moving up through it. The project isn't far enough along to know whether the ""confining layer"" of rock actually will keep the gas from moving upward.\Mulvany said the quality of water in that lower layer of rock also will be analyzed.\Scientists know it has a certain level of saltiness, but Mulvany said if the dissolved solids are below a certain level it could be declared an underground source of drinking water.\""If so there would have to be an exception issued by the EPA for CU to inject down there,"" he said.\Norway plant\Currently there is only one fully operational carbon sequestration project in the world that captures carbon dioxide emissions and deposits them into a saline aquifer.\The Sleipher Platform, located 140 miles off the coast of Norway, extracts carbon dioxide out of natural gas and injects it more than 3,000 feet below the North Sea. The storage formation is under 2,000 feet of shale and removed from drinking water sources.\Two other carbon sequestration projects in Weyburn, Canada, and In Salah, Algeria, use high-pressure carbon dioxide to force oil and gas closer to the surface.\Other experimental injections have taken place in Texas' deep saline aquifers and shallower West Virginia coal seams.\However CU's carbon sequestration effort would be the first of its kind for a saline aquifer at such a shallow depth.\CU is looking to store carbon dioxide at relatively shallow levels since Missouri has no suitable deeper storage areas.\There are ""deep basin"" sites in West Central Plains states where carbon dioxide can be injected at depths of 2 to 4 miles or more, he said.\Energy experts envision a network of pipelines criss-crossing states that would transfer carbon dioxide from power plants and other industrial producers to the deep injection sites.\Pendergrass said that would be a very costly option for CU and its customers. Bond's office estimated CU's pipeline costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\Process has costs\Instead, CU is hoping it can successfully store carbon dioxide locally.\Though it may be less costly than building a carbon dioxide pipeline, sequestering the gas underground isn't without cost.\A Massachusetts Institute of Technology report ""The Future of Coal"" concludes underground carbon dioxide storage is scientifically feasible but likely would raise costs for utility customers.\Why? The injection technology carries high costs.\Still, a utility could recoup some of those costs because the government is likely to start taxing carbon emissions.\""It's pretty clear that coming down the pipe, there's going to be a tax on carbon emissions,"" said Howard Herzog, the principal research engineer at MIT's Laboratory for Energy and the Environment.\No one can yet say how that tax might be structured. Some see a system where companies that successfully sequester carbon dioxide could sell ""credits"" to those that have no way to do so, similar to air pollution ""cap and trade"" systems already allowed by the EPA.\However the price of electricity is likely to increase for ratepayers regardless of the success of CU's experiment, though perhaps not as much as if CU had to pipeline the gas elsewhere.\Even if CU limits its liability by the time a carbon emission tax goes into effect, the process of capturing and storing the gas requires a large capital expense to retrofit existing power plants with new technology.\Electricity needed to capture and compress carbon dioxide can also reduce a power plant's energy output, depending on the technology and the type of coal that's used, according to the MIT study.\To generate the extra energy to capture and sequester carbon dioxide, a power plant would have to buy and burn more coal and those costs likely would be passed on.\Other utilities no doubt will be watching the outcome of CU's pilot project.\""If we can show it can be done safely and successfully in shallow depths, others might be able to do the same,"" Pendergrass said.\News-Leader graphic artist Pete Smith contributed to this story.\On Page 3A\Regulatory hurdles: Before proceeding with a carbon dioxide storage plan, CU would have to apply for a state permit and follow EPA rules.\News-Leader.com\Documents: View reports from City Utilities and the EPA on carbon dioxide sequestration.\Graphic:\How the sequestration project would eventually work\Once a feasibility study is completed, City Utilities workers would bring in a variable amount of food-grade carbon dioxide gas and pump it underground using an injection well.\Monitoring measures\City Utilities maintains three groundwater wells at the Sourhwest Power ;oant site to draw water from the Oark aquifer for cooling purposes. Shuld any CO2 escape from confinement in the St. Francois aquifer, City Utilites estimates it would dissoulve in the fresh water and be detected by the wells that affect the flow of groundwater in the area.\The storage destination\The CO2 would be released at approximately 1800 feet underground in a gaseous state at the beginning of the St. Francois aquifer. There it would begin to displace the natural saline water in the remainder of the bore hole and gradually move upwards and outwards through the pores of the Lamotte sandstone.\Chemical interactions\Some CO2 would dissolve into the saline water. In between the gas plume and water, a mixing zine would occur. CO2 would react with existing minerals in the rock to form small calcite, siderite and magnesite crystals within the pores of the sandstone layers.\Pete Smith - News-Leader\Sources: City Utilities, Missouri State University, University of Missouri-Rolla, Washington University of St. Louis"
136,"WASHINGTON * The White House has made dire long-term predictions about the impact that climate change will have on Midwestern agriculture, forests, water and wildlife.\The assessment is not universally accepted in Congress, but it is central to the debate over proposed new carbon emission limits for coal-fired power plants expected to be released Monday by the Obama administration.\The issue has special resonance in Missouri and Illinois, two of the most coal-dependent states for electricity generation.\It is a tale of two futures. In one, American dependence upon fossil fuels is perilous to humans and the environment. In the other, those fuel sources are part of an ""all of the above"" strategy that unleashes a new era of prosperity.\In its third National Climate Assessment document released last month, the White House said the Midwest already is suffering from the effects of climate change, in part because of its higher-than-average dependence on coal.\""In general, climate change will tend to amplify existing climate-related risks from climate to people, ecosystems and infrastructure in the Midwest,"" said the report, which the White House rolled out to great fanfare, including setting up interviews between the president and local TV meteorologists.\""Direct effects of increased heat stress, flooding, drought and late spring freezes on natural and managed ecosystems may be multiplied by changes in pests and disease prevalence, increased competition from non-native or opportunistic native species, ecosystem disturbances, land-use changes, landscape fragmentation, atmospheric pollutants, and economic shocks such as crop failures or reduced yields due to extreme weather events.\""These added stresses,"" the report says, ""are projected to alter the ecosystem and socioeconomic patterns and processes in ways that most people in the region would consider detrimental.""\But in sentiments echoed by many Republicans, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said that the Midwest is on the cusp of an energy-driven ""renaissance"" in which coal would remain a major component. Obama's ""lose-lose"" energy strategy is holding the region back, Blunt said.\Blunt cited predictions of ""the doubling of world food needs between now and 2070, what I believe will be an increased importance in the Mississippi River and water transportation (and) the European Union's desire to have 20 percent of their utilities come from biomass by 2020.""\Blunt added: ""Our carbon footprint compared to the rest of the world is decreasing. If we do foolish things regarding energy, the jobs that we lose go to countries that care a whole lot less about what comes out of the smokestack than we do.""\BATTLE LINES DRAWN\Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency already have begun a major PR push for the much-anticipated standards to curb pollution from the nation's more than 1,500 coal-fired power plants.\The proposals, which are not expected to be finalized until next year, would require states to curb carbon emissions that scientists say is leading to a warmer climate, stronger storms, melting glaciers and greater human health hazards. Advocates are pushing for a flexible approach that would allow heavily coal-dependent states, such as Missouri and Illinois, some leeway in how they would meet the new standards, through tactics ranging from alternative energy sources to more energy-efficient buildings.\The Natural Resources Defense Council, which has advised the White House on the new standards, calls them ""the opening shot of a pitched battle over how best to combat climate change.""\Two simultaneous events last week, five blocks apart and within a short walk of the White House, illustrated that point. The Natural Resources Defense Council described in a briefing for reporters the new standards as morally right, economically sound and politically advantageous for politicians courageous enough to advocate them.\At the same time, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce unveiled a report saying that tougher carbon emission standards would kill jobs and drive up the price of energy to homeowners and businesses.\Obama's third National Climate Assessment said that 20 million of the roughly 61 million Midwesterners already suffer from poor air quality, and that the problem will only get worse because of further ""human-induced emissions"" and a prolonged exposure to pollen because of longer growing seasons. The report defined the Midwest as Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana and Pennsylvania.\There may be short-term gains in crop yields, ""though these benefits will be progressively offset by extreme weather events,"" says the report, whose lead writers were scientists from federal agencies and Midwestern universities.\Some in Congress have accepted this science and believe it requires sudden and emphatic action. But there are wide variations of attitudes about the economics and efficacy of drastically reducing coal-fired emissions.\Rep. Bill Enyart, D-Belleville, the Democratic chair of the House Coal Caucus, says he believes that while you ""can't say yes or no, black or white"" on the role of coal in future energy production, ""I don't think there has been any question there has been, quote, climate change.""\Farmers, he said, have been among the first to notice it, in longer growing seasons.\""I can tell you the corn growers, particularly, understand they are growing corn in places they weren't 10 years ago"" because of a longer growing season, he said.\He said that while the cause of climate change may be ""an open question in some people's minds, you can't argue that the polar ice caps are not melting. That is a fact. Clearly, there has been global climate change.""\""What we need to do is focus on the research and development of technologies that will get carbon out of coal usage,"" Enyart continued. ""Coal provides 40 percent of our (national) energy. Nobody is going to turn 40 percent of their lights off, no one is going to turn their computer off 40 percent of the time, I don't care how environmentally conscious you are. What we have to do is the (research and development) to drive those technology costs down.""\POWER AND POLITICS\Much is at stake for Missouri, Illinois and other states that are heavily dependent upon coal's production and the power derived from it.\Even with a national push to convert to natural gas and renewable energy, coal supplies roughly 80 percent of Missouri's electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\Overall, in 2012 the last year available for these figures Missouri was the fourth-biggest user of coal to generate electricity, while the more populous Illinois was the second largest.\However, Illinois is less dependent on coal because it is the biggest producer of nuclear power among the 50 states, according to the EIA. More than 40 percent of Illinois' electricity comes from nuclear and coal each, according to the EIA.\Obama's new emissions standards will be a pivotal debate point on who controls the United States Senate the final two years of Obama's presidency.\Thirteen Democratic senators, all but two from states that Obama did not win in 2012, voted along with Republicans last year to kill what was considered a carbon tax trial balloon offered by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., voted no, along with Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La., Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Kay Hagan, D-N.C. The latter three face tough re-election challenges this year.\Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, who represents another state that Obama lost decisively in 2012, voted for Whitehouse's proposal. He also faces a tough re-election campaign and has already seen attack ads run against him over that vote. Alison Lundergan Grimes, who has mounted a serious challenge to Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, describes herself as a ""pro-coal Democrat.""\McCaskill said: ""If you are a red-state Democrat, you are used to tough votes.""\She said that control of carbon emissions ""is an area that really needs moderation. So I'm hopeful that the timing of (the new carbon standards) isn't going to do anything other than reinforce to the people of those states that the Democrats that represent them are grounded, moderate, pragmatic representatives.""\As to the White House climate assessment, McCaskill said: ""I believe that climate change is real, I believe that it is dangerous, I believe that it is the result of man-made activity, and I trust science.\""I'm not happy about this,"" she added, ""but Missouri is incredibly coal-dependent for its energy needs. Which means that any aggressive changes in the availability of coal-fired electricity will have a direct impact on whether or not people with fixed incomes and small businesses can afford their energy bills.""\But Heather Taylor-Miesle, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's political action committee, said she believes politicians who take bolder stands against carbon pollution will be rewarded by voters.\Asked if Democratic senators from Republican or swing states, such as Missouri, were out of touch with that sentiment, Taylor-Miesle replied: ""Yes, I do think that they are out of touch.\""People are seeing this around them, that their children are now more likely to not be able to breathe well, they are not able to go outside on red (air quality) days,"" she said.\MIDWEST IMPACT\Obama's climate assessment noted that the Midwest emits greenhouse gases at a rate 20 percent higher than the national average.\But the region also ""has a large and increasingly utilized potential to reduce emissions that cause climate change,"" including wind and biomass, it says.\Some of the report's key Midwest predictions:\* While there may be momentary yield increases in crops as a result of longer growing seasons, ""the combined stresses associated with climate change are expected to decrease agricultural productivity."" The Midwest produces about 65 percent of the corn and soybeans grown in the United States. The report says that agriculture produces about 8 percent of the nation's heat-trapping gas emissions.\* The region's forests will be driven northward because of rising temperatures, cutting into their capacity as ""a net absorber of carbon.""\The report also said that while the Midwest has great potential for natural gas, wind, biomass and solar power (some areas have as much potential as Florida, the authors say), electricity prices are held artificially low ""through a mix of direct and indirect subsidies,"" thereby lessening the impetus for faster conversion to alternatives.\David Doniger, director of the NRDC's climate and clean air program, said he believes Obama's proposed standards will differentiate among states in ways that could help the coal-dependent if they adapt cleaner energy and conservation measures that other states already have done.\""States that historically have nearly all coal generation would have to make an improvement, but it would be from where they start, and the improvement rate they can make may well be greater, maybe faster, than you would expect from a state like California,"" he said.\Doniger said that for coal-dependent states such as Missouri and Illinois, ""if they invest in efficiencies in ways that some states already have, they are going to find a really big pot of low-cost emission reductions just waiting there to be scooped up.""\Credit: Chuck Raasch; craasch@post-dispatch.com; 202-298-6880"

CLINTON ECONOMIC PLAN
\
Here are excerpts from President Bill Clinton's address Wednesday to a joint session of Congress:
\
WHEN PRESIDENTS speak to the Congress and the nation from this podium, typically they comment on the full range of challenges and opportunities that face the United States. But this is not an ordinary time. And for all the many tasks that require our attention, I believe tonight one calls on us to focus, to unite, and to act - and that is our economy. For more than anything else, our task tonight as Americans is to make our economy thrive again.
\
. . . We have always been a people of youthful energy and daring spirit. And at this historic moment, as communism has fallen, as freedom is spreading around the world, as a global economy is taking shape before our eyes, Americans have called for change - and now it is up to those of us in this room to deliver for them.
\
. . . We need to break the old habits of both political parties and say there can be no more something for nothing, and admit frankly that we are all in this together.
\
I well remember 12 years ago President Reagan stood at this podium and told you and the American people that if our debt were stacked in thousand-dollar bills, the stack would reach 67 miles into space. Well, today that stack would reach 267 miles.
\
I tell you this not to assign blame for this problem. There is plenty of blame to go around - in both branches of the government and both parties. The time has come for the blame to end. I did not seek this office to place blame. I come here to accept responsibility, and I want you to accept responsibility with me, and, if we do right by this country, I do not care who gets the credit for it.
\
. . . Tonight I want to talk with you about what government can do because I believe government must do more. But let me say first that the real engine of economic growth in this country is the private sector.
\
And second, that each of us must be an engine of growth and change. The truth is that, as government creates more opportunity in this new and different time, we must also demand more responsibility in turn.
\
. . . To create jobs and guarantee a strong recovery, I call on Congress to enact an immediate package of jobs investments of over $30 billion, to put people to work now, to create a half a million jobs, jobs to rebuild our highways and airports, to renovate housing, to bring new life to rural communities, and spread hope and opportunity among our nation's youth.
\
. . . The heart of this plan deals with the long term. It is an investment program designed to increase public and private investment in areas critical to our economic future and it has a deficit reduction program that will increase the savings available for the private sector to invest, will lower interest rates, will decrease the percentage of the federal budget claimed by interest payments and decrease the risk of financial market disruptions that could adversely affect our economy.
\
Over the long run, all this will bring us a higher rate of economic growth, improved productivity, more high-quality jobs and an improved economic competitive position in the world. In order to accomplish both increased investment and deficit reduction - something no American government has ever been called upon to do at the same time before - spending must be cut and taxes must be raised. The spending cuts I recommend were carefully thought through in a way to minimize any adverse economic impact, to capture the peace dividend for investment purposes and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to more investment. The tax increases and the spending cuts were both designed to assure that the costs of this historic program to face and deal with our problems will be borne by those who could readily afford it the most.
\
. . . We propose a permanent investment tax credit for the smallest firms in this country with revenues of under $5 million.
\
That's about 90 percent of the firms in America, employing about 40 percent of the work force, but creating a big majority of the net new jobs for more than a decade. And we propose new rewards for entrepreneurs who take new risks. We propose to give small business access to all the new technologies of our time, and we propose to attack this credit crunch which has denied small business the credit they need to flourish and prosper.
\
With a new network of community development banks and $1 billion to make the dream of enterprise zones real, we propose to bring new hope and new jobs to storefronts and factories from South Boston to South Texas to South Central Los Angeles.
\
This plan invests in our roads, our bridges, our transit systems and high-speed railways and high-tech information systems. And it provides the most ambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with state and local government of our time, to put people to work and to preserve the environment for our future. . . . We must provide special assistance to areas and to workers displaced by cuts in the defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocations.
\
But all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail - let me say this again; I feel so strongly about this - all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail unless we also take this year - not next year, not five years from now, but this year - bold steps to reform our health care system.
\
. . . Unless we change the present pattern, 50 percent of the growth in the deficit between now and the year 2000 will be in health care costs. By the year 2000 almost 20 percent of our income will be (used for) health care.
\
. . . Later this spring, after the first lady and the many good people who are helping her all across the country complete their work, I will deliver to Congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform . . . so that no one will be denied the coverage they need but so that our economic future will not be compromised either.
\
. . . If we believe in jobs and we believe in learning, we must believe in rewarding work. . . . the new direction I propose will make this solemn, simple commitment: by expanding the refundable earned income tax credit, we will make history; we will reward the work of millions of working poor Americans by realizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you've got a child in the house, you will no longer be in poverty.
\
. . . Our next great goal should be strengthen our families. I compliment the Congress for passing the Family and Medical Leave Act as a good first step.
\
But it is time to do more. This plan will give this country the toughest child support enforcement it has ever had. It has time to demand that people take responsibility for the child they bring into this world.
\
And I ask you to help to protect our families against the violent crime which terrorizes our people and which our communities apart. We must pass a tough crime bill.
\
. . . And I support an initiative to do what we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. I will make you this bargain: If you pass the Brady bill, I'll sure sign it.
\
. . . Next, to revolutionize government, we have to ensure that we live within our means and that should start at the top and with the White House.
\
In the last few days, I have announced a cut in the White House staff of 25 percent, saving approximately $10 million. I have ordered administrative cuts in budgets of agencies and departments, I have cut the federal bureaucracy, or will over the next four years, by approximately 100,000 positions, for a combined savings of $9 billion.
\
. . . Tonight I call for an across-the-board freeze in federal government salaries for one year. And thereafter during this four-year period, I recommend that salaries rise at one point lower than the cost-of-living allowance normally involved in federal pay increases.
\
Next I recommend that we make 150 specific budget cuts, as you know; and that all those who say we should cut more be as specific as I have been.
\
. . . Some things work and some things don't. We ought to be subsidizing the things that work and discouraging the things that don't. I'd like to use that Superfund to clean up pollution for change and not just pay lawyers.
\
. . . But in the end, we have to get back to the deficit. . . . We have to cut the deficit because the more we spend paying off the debt, the less tax dollars we have to invest in jobs, in education and the future of this country.
\
And the more money we take out of the pool of available savings, the harder it is for people in the private sector to borrow money at affordable interest rates for a college loan for their children, for a home mortgage, or to start a new business. That's why we've got to reduce the debt, because it is crowding out other activities that we ought to be engaged in and that the American people ought to be engaged in.
\
. . . If we just stay with the same trends of the last four years, by the end of the decade the deficit will be $635 billion a year, almost 80 percent of our gross domestic product, and paying interest on that debt will be the costliest government program of all.
\
We will not be able to have the independence we need to chart the future that we must, and we'll be terribly dependent on foreign funds for a large portion of our investment.
\
This budget plan, by contrast, will by 1997 cut $140 billion in that year alone from the deficit, a real spending cut, a real revenue increase, a real deficit reduction, using the independent numbers of the Congressional Budget Office.
\
Well, you can laugh, my fellow Republicans, but I'll point out that the Congressional Budget Office was normally more conservative in what was going to happen and closer to right than previous presidents have been.
\
I did this so that we could argue about priorities with the same set of numbers; I did this so that no one could say I was estimating my way out of this difficulty; I did this because if we can agree together on the most prudent revenues we're likely to get - if the recovery stays and we do right things economically, then it'll turn out better for the American than we say.
\
. . . We're going to have to have no sacred cows except the fundamental, abiding interest of the American people.
\
I have to say that we all know our government has been just great at building programs. The time has come to show the American people that we can limit them, too, that we can not only start things, but we can actually stop things.
\
About the defense budget, I raise a hope and a caution. As we restructure our military to meet the new threats of the post-Cold War world, it is true that we can responsibly reduce our defense budget. And we may all doubt what that range of reductions is, but let me say that as long as I am president, I will do everything I can to make sure that the men and women who serve under the American flag will remain the best trained, the best prepared, the best equipped fighting force in the world, and every one of you should make that solemn pledge.
\
. . . I know this economic plan is ambitious, . . . and I think it is paid for fairly, first by cutting government, then by asking the most of those who benefitted the most in the past and by asking more Americans to contribute today so that all of us can prosper tomorrow.
\
For the wealthiest - those earning more than $180,000 per year - I ask you all who are listening tonight to support a raise in the top rate for federal income taxes from 31 to 36 percent. We recommend a 10 percent surtax on incomes over $250,000 a year and we recommend closing some loopholes that some people get away without paying any tax at all.
\
For businesses with taxable incomes in excess of $10 million, we recommend a raise in the corporate rate, also to 36 percent, as well as a cut in the deduction for business entertainment expenses.
\
Our plan seeks to attack tax subsides that actually reward companies more for shutting their operations down here and moving them overseas than for staying here and reinvesting in America. I say that as someone who believes that American companies should be free to invest around the world and as a former governor who actively sought investment of foreign companies in my state. But the tax code should not express a preference to American companies for moving somewhere else, and it does in particular cases today.
\
We will seek to insure that through effective tax enforcement foreign corporations who do make money in America simply pay the same taxes that American companies make (sic) on the same income.
\
To middle-class Americans who have paid a great deal for the last 12 years and from whom I ask a contribution tonight, I will say again, as I did on Monday, you're not going alone any more - you're certainly not going first, and you're not going to pay more for less as you have too often in the past.
\
I want to emphasize the facts about this plan: 98.8 percent of America's families will have no increase in their income tax rates, only 1.2 percent at the top.
\
There will also be no new cuts in benefits for Medicare.
\
. . . There must be plan cuts in payments to providers - to doctors, to hospitals, to labs - as a way of controlling health care costs, but I see these only as a stopgap until we can reform the entire health care system. . . . The only change we are making in Social Security is one that has already been publicized: the plan does ask older Americans with higher incomes who do not rely solely on Social Security to get by to contribute more. This plan will not affect the 80 percent of Social Security recipients who do not pay taxes on Social Security now. Those who do not pay tax on Social Security now will not be affected by this plan.
\
Our plan does include a broad-based tax on energy. And I want to tell you why I selected this and why I think it's a good idea. I recommend that we adopt a Btu tax on the heat content of energy as the best way to provide us with revenue to lower the deficit, because it also combats pollution, promotes energy efficiency, promotes the independence economically of this country as well as helping to reduce the debt, and because it does not discriminate against any area.
\
Unlike a carbon tax, it's not too hard on the coal states; unlike a gas tax, it's not too tough on people who drive a long way to work; unlike an ad valorem tax, it doesn't increase just when the price of an energy source goes up. And it is environmentally responsible; it will help us in the future as well as in the present with the deficit.
\
Taken together, these measures will cost an American family with an income of about $40,000 a year less than $17 a month. It will cost American families with incomes under $30,000 nothing because of other programs we propose, principally those raising the earned income tax credit.
\
Because of our publicly stated determination to reduce the deficit, if we do these things, we will see the continuation of what's happened just since the election.
\
. . . Unless we have the courage now to start building our future and stop borrowing from it, we're condemning ourselves to years of stagnation, interrupted by occasional recessions, to slow growth in jobs, to no more growth in incomes, to more debt, to more disappointment.
\
. . . Our people will be watching and wondering . . . whether we're all going to conduct ourselves as if we know we're working for them. We must scale the walls of the people's skepticism, not with our words but with our deeds.
\
. . . My fellow Americans, the test of this plan cannot be what is in it for me; it has got to be what is in it for us.
\
If we work hard and if we work together, if we rededicate ourselves to creating jobs, to rewarding work, to strengthening our families, to reinvesting our government, we can lift our country's fortunes again. . . . This must be America's new direction. Let us summon the courage to seize it.
\
Thank you. God bless America.

138,"The March 11 earthquake in Japan led to a tsunami that crippled the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. While a similar situation is not likely at any U.S. nuclear plant, we must use this to look at our country's lack of a central storage facility for nuclear waste.\The first commercial nuclear power plant began operating in the United States in 1960. In 1982, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act made the federal government responsible for collecting nuclear waste.\In 1987, Yucca Mountain was named the sole site for a permanent repository of nuclear waste. The Department of Energy confirmed the scientific side of this decision in 1994. In 2002, Congress and the president approved Yucca Mountain again. In 2008, DOE filed a license application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build Yucca Mountain.\Obviously, the decision to move forward with a national nuclear waste repository has been supported by Republican and Democratic-controlled Congresses and Republican- and Democrat presidents over all these years.\I have visited Yucca Mountain. It is located on federal property. The storage site would be 1,000 feet below ground in a remote desert location. Earthquakes have had little impact on this area and are even less an impact underground.\Today, we store nuclear waste at each of the 121 sites in 39 states. Nuclear power provides over 20 percent of our nation's electricity. That number is closer to 50 percent in Illinois.\In Illinois, eight pools house spent nuclear fuel rods from the 13 nuclear power plants, 11 of which still are operating. Two pools are within 40 miles of downtown Chicago. Is that really where we want to store nuclear waste?\In testimony before the Senate on March 30, Massachusetts Institute of Technology physics professor Dr. Ernest Moniz called for these spent fuel rods to be stored in ""dry"" casks at regional government facilities. Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., agreed.\While I agree with the government following its own law and taking control of nuclear waste, I question why we should throw away the $14.5 billion already spent on Yucca Mountain. We don't need regional sites; we already have designated a consolidated government storage site.\Also on March 30 President Obama called for an increase in nuclear power as part of a clean energy standard. While I may not agree with a mandated standard, I know that nuclear power will continue to be vital in our nation's electricity portfolio.\Unfortunately President Obama and his administration have unilaterally halted work on Yucca Mountain. They would rather see nuclear waste stored all over the country instead of in Nevada - home of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\I believe the administration is failing to carry out the current federal law. In order to find out exactly why the administration halted work on Yucca Mountain, under our oversight authority House Energy and Commerce Committee, chairman Fred Upton, R-Michigan, and I are proceeding with an investigation. On March 31, we sent letters to the secretary of Energy and to the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\In addition, as part of our oversight and responsibility to ratepayers and taxpayers, I will be leading a delegation of legislators to tour Yucca Mountain later this month.\Past Congresses and administrations have approved Yucca Mountain. While it has taken too long to become reality, this administration cannot rewrite the law or pull already issued permits away from it.\In order to expand nuclear power, Yucca Mountain must become a reality.\---\U.S. Rep. John Shimkus, R-Collinsville, is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy, which has jurisdiction over federal nuclear waste policy."

City plans for programs to lower energy usage
\
Customer demand plays a large role in the future of Columbia's energy portfolio, and utility managers are working on incentives to encourage users to cut down their energy use.
\
Last year, consulting firm Burns & McDonnell completed a detailed look at the city's power supply, known as an integrated resource plan.
\
Demand-side management, as it's known in the energy industry, essentially is examining a home's or business' energy requirements, said Barbara Buffaloe, Environment and Energy Commission chairwoman. The city is looking to ramp up its demand-side management incentives to increase participation from home and business owners in energy-saving programs.
\
By doing this, customers could save themselves money and decrease the need for the electric utility to buy more energy or build another power plant.
\
""The idea behind demand-side management is that it's cheaper to buy efficiency from customers than to buy energy,"" Water and Light spokeswoman Connie Kacprowicz said. ""What we can save annually as we ramp this up is $7 million to $14 million.""

Festival group pays up, pitches ticketing idea
\
Alleviating a lingering concern that has caused several Columbia City Council members to hesitate giving enthusiastic support for the 2009 Roots 'N Blues 'N BBQ Festival, representatives from Thumper Entertainment this week handed over a $38,000 check to pay off an outstanding city invoice.
\
Steve Sweitzer and Terry Woodruff, Thumper partners, along with other festival representatives gave a presentation at Monday's pre-council meeting to discuss the payment and a new feature of the festival this year: admission tickets. For the past two years, the festival has been free for fans, but Sweitzer has said that charging for admission is necessary to make the event financially feasible.
\
In Thumper's proposed operational agreement, tickets purchased before the festival would cost $10 for a one-day pass and $15 for a weekend pass. Those who purchase tickets the weekend of the event, Sept. 25-26, would pay $15 for a one-day ticket and $25 for a weekend pass. Children 12 and younger will be admitted free. Based on the festival footprint, about 26,000 tickets will be available.
\
The council will hold a public hearing and vote on the festival operational agreement at its July 20 meeting.

Sheltered workshop limits layoffs since end of 3M deal
\
In April, Central Missouri Sheltered Enterprises Director Bruce Young said layoffs would be ""inevitable"" after 3M Co. ended a more than 30-year outsourcing relationship with the workshop. At the time, 3M was providing 70 percent of the Columbia workshop's workload, but that partnership ended in May.
\
The workshop completed $980,000 in contract work in 2007-08.
\
So far, Young has been able to avoid laying off any of the 125 developmentally disabled workers employed at Columbia's sheltered workshop. However, three office workers were laid off, and two workshop employees moved to the traditional work force. Young said none of those positions will be filled at this time.
\
The workshop has added some small contracts, and Young has done some restructuring to hold layoffs at bay. The second shift was eliminated, and some workers are on three- or four-day workweeks.

Gov. Jay Nixon approves bill on car dealer fees
\
Gov. Jay Nixon has signed into law legislation that allows car and boat dealers to charge customers a fee of less than $200 to cover administrative costs associated with the sale.
\
Many auto dealers charge such fees now. The Missouri Automobile Dealers Association and other interest groups had sought passage of the measure in the face of lawsuits that had been filed around the state contending that charging a fee for paperwork amounted to practicing law without a license.
\
Suits have been filed around the state challenging dealership fees, said Mitchell Burgess, an attorney in Kansas City. He said charging a fee for such work could amount to practicing law without a license or be so misleading that it violates the state's Merchandising Practices Act.
\
Burgess said suits have been filed over charges of $149 and $399. He said lawyers representing plaintiffs around the state are trying to develop a class action case that would show millions of dollars have been collected illegally.
\
Last year, James Gumm of Maywood sued Joe Machens Ford Inc. in Boone County Circuit Court over a $50 document fee assessed when he bought a 2005 Ford truck in 2005. The suit is pending.

As the summer months bring hot afternoons and more residents switch on air conditioners, Columbia's electric utility said this is the perfect time to capture customer attention about ways to save residents and the city money on energy.
\
INCENTIVES FOR SAVING ENERGY
\
Demand-side management programs work to decrease customers' energy use. Conserving energy and using it efficiently can lower electric bills and keep the city's peak demand down, which lessens the need for finding ways to generate new energy, such as building a power plant.
\
The city already offers several such programs, including:
\
Tree power: Residents can receive one free 6- to 10-foot shade tree per electric meter. A Columbia Water and Light representative will visit your property and suggest ideal placement.
\
Super-saver and home-performance loans: Loans through the city, with interest rates between 0.53 percent and 2.5 percent, can be used for improvements that make homes more energy-efficient, such as insulation, new windows and heat pumps. A home performance assessment will cost a resident between $250 and $400 but will make the resident eligible for more loans and a longer payback period.
\
Rebates: The city offers rebates on energy-efficient air conditioners, heat pumps and solar energy systems. Each rebate is calculated based on energy savings.
\
The proposed new demand-side management program would add:
\
? Higher rebates on energy-efficient windows, as much as $580 per customer
\
? Rebates on attic and duct insulation and duct sealing
\
? Customized programs for commercial users
\
The Columbia City Council this month will consider a Water and Light Department proposal to expand the city's demand-side management programs, which aim to reduce customer energy use. It would cost about $1.3 million annually.
\
Consulting firm Burns and McDonnell has prepared a slew of recommendations for the city's demand-side management program, including hiring three new staff members and ramping up programs targeting customer conservation.
\
Members of the city's Environment and Energy Commission said that demand-side management plan is a step in the right direction, but they would like to see more. In February, the commission sent a letter to the city council detailing issues they would like to see addressed in the plan.
\
As home to three colleges, Columbia has a large rental market, and the commission said there are no incentives for renters and landlords built into the plan.
\
Commission chairwoman Barbara Buffaloe said cities such as Austin, Texas, have found ways to capture that market. Carlos Cordova of Austin Energy said that city's multifamily incentive programs offset 4.6 megawatts of power, almost 9 percent of all of the city's energy savings last year.
\
Water and Light spokeswoman Connie Kacprowicz said the 2009 proposal is not the full rollout of the demand-side management program improvements and that Water and Light staff would like to brainstorm with Environment and Energy Commission members on incentives for adding energy-saving measures to rental units.
\
""The rental, as well as low-income, is something we need to work on and address,"" she said. ""We have in the past talked with the landlord associations about federal incentives, but we want to work more closely with Environment and Energy to get landlords interested.""
\
Buffaloe also said simply making people aware of how much energy they are using compared to their neighbors and to national standards could go a long way to encouraging them to make efficiency upgrades. The Environment and Energy Commission suggested putting that information on bills.
\
Kacprowicz said the physical space on the billing sheet is a limiting factor, as is the staff time needed to extract such data from department statistics.
\
""We have come up with mock-ups,"" she said, adding that a report will be sent back to the commission to move the idea along.
\
Although the department's advertising budget has been decreasing, Kacprowicz and Buffaloe said increased awareness is a key to resident participation.
\
""I think people are taking advantage of"" demand-side management programs, Buffaloe said. ""One part where it may fall short is people knowing the possibilities and knowing how to apply them to their situation.""

\
AP: Pending bill would allow utilities to recoup costs
\
Last year, consulting firm Burns & McDonnell completed a detailed look at the city's power supply, known as an integrated resource plan.
\
""What's 'integrated' about it is that it looked at the two halves of it -- a supply-side analysis about where the power is coming from now and in the future, and then there's the demand side,"" said Tom O'Connor, a member of the Water and Light Advisory Board and the Environment and Energy Commission. ""It's sort of the yin and the yang of it. The other side is how you can use less power.""
\
Demand-side management, as it's known in the energy industry, is essentially examining a home's or business' energy requirements, said Barbara Buffaloe, Environment and Energy Commission chairwoman. The city is looking to ramp up its demand-side management incentives with the goal of increasing participation from home and business owners in energy-saving programs.
\
By doing this, customers could save themselves money and decrease the need for the electric utility to buy more energy or build another power plant.
\
""The idea behind demand-side management is that it's cheaper to buy efficiency from customers than to buy energy,"" Water and Light spokeswoman Connie Kacprowicz said. ""What we can save annually as we ramp this up is $7 million to $14 million.""
\
Rates depend on what it costs the utility to run the system, so decreased energy consumption should help control rates, Kacprowicz said. Pending state legislation would allow private utilities to charge customers for efficiency programs, but Columbia's municipal utility is not subject to such regulations, she said.
\
Tonight, the Columbia City Council will hear a first reading, but not vote, on changes to the city's demand-side management programs, including new incentives and three new full-time staff positions to handle them.
\
For the rest of fiscal year 2009, the changes would cost $659,500, paid for through revenue from the electric utility. To continue the program for the next fiscal year would cost about $1.3 million.
\
Many changes put an emphasis on commercial users. Because these customers make up more than half the customer base, Kacprowicz said another staff member is needed to handle the load.
\
Appliance and HVAC retrofitting are examples of programs the utility wants to offer to commercial users. In addition to the solar rebates and weatherization program, the utility would like to increase incentives for attic insulation and energy-efficient windows.
\
""With our residential programs, with what we're doing now, we're fairly tapped,"" Kacprowicz said. ""Staff is working overtime to keep up with that.""
\
A hole in the program is the exclusion of incentives for residents who rent and their landlords.
\
""Traditionally, it's the landlord who would pay for any upgrades, and the incentives are not in the right places for that to work,"" O'Connor said. ""Certain places around the country have come up with clever programs to address that.""

Six months after launching a nationwide search for a new director of the Water and Light Department, Kraig Kahler, head of the municipal utility system in Weatherford, Texas, emerged as the top choice for the position.
\
""Kraig is kind of low-key, quiet and very intelligent,"" City Manager Bill Watkins said this morning. ""Obviously, he's a good problem solver. I actually went down to Texas, met with him and his family, some of his employees and the chairman of the utility board. I have a very positive feeling about his management style and his priorities.""
\
Kahler replaces Dan Dasho, who resigned as the head of the water and light department in December to take a job with the Cloverland Electric Cooperative in Michigan. Kahler (pronounced KAY-ler) will be paid an annual salary of $150,000 and a monthly car allowance of $375, along with insurance and retirement benefits, said Toni Messina, the city's public communications director.
\
Watkins said Kahler's experience meshed well with Columbia's needs and opportunities. ""We have demand-side management, and we're so far ahead of most communities ... but he will learn that quickly,"" Watkins said. ""He's anxious to learn and said ... he felt like that was something he could learn from us. He's a very hard worker, from what I heard. His employees like him, and I think he is probably pretty demanding.""
\
Watkins noted that in Texas, electric utilities are deregulated and cities must compete with the private sector for business. In that environment, Kahler had to keep rates reasonable and negotiate power contracts.
\
""He is very customer service-oriented, and that's one of the things I was looking for,"" Watkins said.
\
Kahler has about 20 years of municipal and private-sector experience in Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas and Missouri. He earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, with a concentration in power systems, from Kansas State University in 1985.
\
""We said we wouldn't hold that against him,"" Watkins joked this morning of his alma mater.
\
Kahler, 45, also earned an MBA from the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs and is a certified professional engineer, a requirement under the city charter.
\
As the director of utilities in Weatherford, Kahler managed a department with a $56 million budget that administered the city's electric, water and wastewater systems. By comparison, Columbia's Water & Light Department has an annual budget of more than $130 million.
\
Columbia ""is a much larger system then where I'm working, and that's a positive thing,"" Kahler said. ""I'd like to come in and establish a good rapport with the current professionals in the organization. I want to provide them with tools to do their jobs and perform in my position as well.""
\
Kahler and his wife, Karen, have two teenage daughters, Emily 17, and Lauren, 15, who are members of a rock band called Daze Off. They have one son, Sean, 9.
\
Kahler said he will work in Texas through the first week of July and then make a house-hunting trip to Columbia. Watkins said Kahler would start working for the city in mid-July.
\
The city hired consulting firm Mycoff Fry & Prouse LLC to find and recruit candidates for the job.
\
The search sparked conversations with the Columbia City Council about salary ranges for department heads after the consulting firm said a competitive range would be $140,000 to $180,000. The previous cap for department heads was $129,000, and the city council voted early this month to boost that maximum to $155,000.

David Wilson had said today's teens are more environmentally savvy than their parents, and the students in Tony Kardis' chemistry class at Horton Watkins High School in Ladue lived up to that with a few grenade-like questions lobbed Wilson's way.
\
Wilson, who represents Union Electric, was a guest lecturer in the class one morning last week. His mission was to explain a program being introduced into high schools throughout the country by the electric power industry.
\
Called ""In Concert with the Environment,"" the program asks the students to become efficiency snoops in their own homes. They ferret out such energy hogs as aging appliances, uninsulated walls and water-wasting bathroom fixtures.
\
But these 25 or so students didn't want to talk about weatherization and shower heads. They wanted to play hardball.
\
Union Electric buys low-sulfur coal that comes from strip mines out West, said one student. Does the environmental benefit of using low-sulfur coal outweigh the damage done by strip-mining?
\
Wilson conceded that the power industry's record on the subject ""hadn't been good, nationally.""
\
""But laws now require strip-mined areas to be reclaimed,"" he replied with a smile.
\
Alex Wolin, 17, followed up: ""Are you guys also investing in solar energy to get away from coal?""
\
The affable Wilson didn't know the answer, but promised to get back to the class later with the information.
\
Yvonne Crane, a sophomore in blue headband and gray Yale sweatshirt, then cut to the quick.
\
Almost apologetically, she said: ""I'm curious because I thought you guys, Union Electric, would want us to be using more electricity, not saving it.""
\
Wilson's answer to that one involved ""demand-side planning,"" the heart of the program he was presenting to the class.
\
It's very expensive to build new power plants, he said. If utility companies can curtail the demand for electricity by encouraging energy efficiency and conservation, they can avoid those costs.
\
UE has a recent example of demand-side management that shows how energy efficiency in the home can curb a community's power needs.
\
The company initially sought to build a pair of nuclear power plants in Callaway County, but pared that back to a single plant when the demand projections fell drastically short.
\
Asked why their energy forecasts back then had been so far off, an executive replied: ""Air conditioners.""
\
He explained that electrical demand shot up in the 1950s with the arrival of window air conditioners. That demand, however, slacked off as more efficient central air conditioning followed in the next decade.
\
Wilson could be excused for not knowing the company line on all the students' queries. He represents UE in a roundabout way.
\
Wilson formerly was director of education for the St. Louis Science Center.
\
He left the job last December to join EcoGroup Inc., a Phoenix company that created the ""In Concert with the Environment"" program and is selling it to utilities.
\
Wilson still works for EcoGroup, but he gets his paycheck from UE while spreading the educational program to high schools throughout the utility's service area.
\
""We hope to be doing about 10,000 students by this spring,"" he said.
\
Besides the high school in Ladue, the program is now in 10 schools in the St. Louis area and one in Jefferson City.
\
UE already helps businesses control their electrical bills, Wilson said; this program confronts the residential client by taking the company right into the home via the students.
\
""Young people are the ones who tend to be more ready to do something about the environment,"" he said. ""You hear more stories about children pushing their parents to start recycling in the home.""
\
After his grilling in Kurdis' class, Wilson moved to an adjacent lab room where two students were working at computer terminals.
\
They had conducted the ""energy audit"" of their homes and were entering their results into Wilson's computer program.
\
The audit asks nearly 100 questions, from the size and age of the family water heater and refrigerator to how often certain appliances are used.
\
Karen Sachs, 17, admitted that most of her answers were ""guesstimates"" provided by her mother.
\
""She put down that we use our dishwasher 17 times a week - we hardly ever use it,"" said Sachs. ""And 20 loads per week in the washing machine. Sure, Mom.""
\
When senior Hilary Woollen finished entering her data - which included seven window air conditioners in her home - the computer analyzed the results and printed out an annual expenditure report.
\
It showed the family's total energy costs were $2,935, with a large part going to heating and cooling.
\
""If I was paying it, I wouldn't be using so much energy,"" said Woollen.
\
The program measures energy efficiency in ""ecowatts,"" which is defined as an environmental benefit derived from saving energy. For instance, a family can gain ecowatts by recycling because re-using a material saves energy.
\
Electricity is not the only energy source tabulated in the program. It also takes a look at a family's method of transportation, and suggests how it might cut down on oil and gasoline.
\
Transportation was the top energy cost in Woollen's report.
\
""We have three cars for me, my brother and my Mom,"" she said. ""We can't really car pool. We all go to different places.""
\
While the teen-agers gave a thumbs up to recycling and replacing outdated appliances, they reacted with a resounding ""NOT"" to Wilson's suggestion that they save oil by giving up driving one day out of every 10.
\
Many of the students were 16 and 17, and had just latched onto the keys to the family car.
\
""I guess that says something about the society we live in,"" shrugged Wilson. ""I'm sure we'd do a lot more planning when we drove if the cost of gas was $10 a gallon.""
"

The Missouri Public Service Commission has approved an agreement in a Kansas City Power & Light case that will enact a series of energy efficiency programs.
\
Several parties were included in the agreement, which falls under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act. They include the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council. The state's Office of the Public Counsel also filed a statement indicating it supports the agreement. The office is a separate agency that represents the public in matters before the commission.
\
Under the agreement, KCP&L will implement 12 programs that include income-eligible weatherization to assist residential customers in reducing energy usage and a home lighting rebate program. Customers also will be able to earn rebates for air conditioning upgrades and home appliance recycling, and can analyze their home energy use and receive home energy reports.
\
The eight residential and four business programs are expected to start in July.
\
Also, KCP&L will establish a charge on customers' bills to recover demand-side management program costs and incentives. The charge will appear as a separate line item on monthly electric bills starting this summer.
\
MEEIA was signed into law in 2009 and was enacted through a rule the commission approved in February 2011. Its design is to create new energy efficiency options that can help consumers cut down on the amount of energy consumed, reduce costs and help the environment.
\
KCP&L filed for the programs in January. The act allows all utilities in Missouri to offer energy efficiency programs to their customers.

Last year, Arch had sales of $2.4 billion, its second-best year since becoming a public company a decade ago.\With global warming a topic of high concern for many people around the world, it's interesting to hear a coal company executive defend the black hydrocarbon fuel for electrical power plants and steel mills.

Right now, China is burning approximately 2.7 billion tons of coal per year. The U.S. is burning a little over 1 billion tons.

China has about 80 percent of the energy efficiency that we have. If we do something draconian here (to combat carbon dioxide emissions), steel mills will move to China and elsewhere in Asia where standards will not be as high.

Trash Plan Renewed JEFFERSON CITY - It's in the bag for another year. The Conservation Department not only will renew, but will expand its popular ""Stash Your Trash"" program, which provides mesh trash sacks to river users on Missouri's float streams.
\
Last year, the department distributed 50,000 of the re-usable mesh sacks, similar to what citrus fruits come in, through canoe outfitters on 11 streams.
\
The outfitters felt the bags not only helped clean up the rivers, but also educated river users to litter problems. Some 70 percent of conservation agents queried and nearly all outfitters noticed a reduction of litter along the rivers.
\
Virtually all of both groups felt the program should continue, so Jerry J. Presley, director of the Conservation Department, decided to expand the program to all the major Ozark float streams this year.
\
The number of bags will jump from 50,000 to 200,000. For some reason the mesh bags invite use - outfitters reported that in previous years they'd given out plastic bags that weren't used, but that almost none of the mesh bags came back unused.
\
The mesh bag idea originated with the National Park Service on the Ozark National Scenic Riverways (Current and Jacks Fork rivers) two years ago.
\
Some 20,000 sacks given out there collected 20 tons of trash, including 1.5 tons of recyclable aluminum that was sold and the money donated to a local sheltered workshop.
\
The sacks can be tied to a thwart and will hold cans and bottles, perhaps the major source of litter on float streams.
\
Eagle Nests Protected
\
JEFFERSON CITY - Missouri has as many known bald eagle nests this spring as there were decades since the last known nest.
\
There are four active nests (and perhaps two more). It was four decades between the last known nest and the first recent one.
\
Bald eagle nests are protected by federal law. Anyone harassing nesting eagles or disturbing the nest faces a possible $20,000 fine and a year in jail.
\
Two of the known nests are in central Missouri, the other two in southeast Missouri at Mingo National Wildlife Refuge and nearby Duck Creek Wildlife Area.
\
Doing It The E asy Way
\
LINN - And they talk about wildlife managment being a cold, lonely, arduous profession. What a laugh!
\
At least after the experience that Tom Hutton and others had recently while trapping wild turkeys for a Conservation Department video to be used in the department's statewide television program.
\
Osage County conservation agent Gary Howard set up a baited trap site on the farm of Mr. and Mrs. Mark Haviland, south of Linn . . . in their back yard.
\
A generation of turkey trappers has spent countless hours crouched in icy blinds (turkey trapping is a dead-of-winter occupation), with a numb finger on the firing button of a device that propels a net over the baited birds.
\
This time the blind was the Haviland house, comfortable and warm.
\
At the assigned time, a television crew, Howard, wildlife biologist Hutton, and department television producer Deborah Rogers were in place.
\
""It meant an early wake-up, but trappers, cameras and crew were in place by 6:30 a.m.,"" Hutton said. ""When the birds came in at 8, we were busy drinking strong coffee and eating stale doughnut holes in the comfort of the Haviland living room.""
\
All of them will grind their teeth when Hutton says, ""After some suspenseful footage, we touched it off while watching the birds on a television monitor. What a way to trap turkeys!""
\
Missouri, more than any other state, has used its wild turkeys as trade material for ruffed groused, otters, pheasants and other itmes. But each turkey traded is one that has to be trapped with a cannon or rocket net.
\
The department's syndicated television show is on 14 stations weekly around the state, on different days and at different times.

Prairie Day June 11
\
LAMAR - Back in the 1880s, Hamlin Garland wrote a fictionalized autobiography called ""A Boy's Life on the Prairie.""
\
In the introduction, he said, ""It is a vanished world now, that of the prairie. . . ."" Much of Missouri once was part of this vanished world, and on June 11, Missourians will have a chance to see and find out more about their lost heritage.
\
Prairie Day will be from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the 2,240-acre Prairie State Park, west of Lamar. It will be a cooperative venture of the departments of Conservation and Natural Resources.
\
A highlight of the event will be the dedication of the visitor's center at the park. The public is invited and everything is free.
\
""Prairie Day is both fun and educational,"" says Nancy Priddy, Conservation Department naturalist and coordinator of the event.
\
""There will be guided nature walks, talks on birds, mammals, reptiles and other animals of the prairie, and recreated scenes from the past.""
\
Past ""living history"" recreations have included a drover's camp from the days when Missouri was a finish for trail drives. Plans this year are to have an Indian agent, Indians and cavalry.
\
Other recreations are a pioneer family camp and a fur trapper campsite.
\
Missouri once was one-third native tallgrass prairie, some 15 million acres. Now, less than 80,000 acres remain. Most Missourians have never seen the richness of an unplowed prairie, with its tall grasses and rich flowers.
\
Native prairie remains the only ecological community unprotected by a national park, such as the Flint Hills of Kansas.
\
Historically, such states as Illinois (nicknamed the Prairie State) and Iowa were almost all native prairie, but now are almost all farmland.
\
The explorer Joliet reported in 1673 that the prairie soil he found on his journey through Illinois and down the Mississippi River was rich and ready for cultivation.
\
It was that richness that doomed the native prairie. Grasses up to a dozen feet high fell before the settlers' plows.
\
In 1821, famed explorer Henry Rowe Schoolcraft wrote that the prairies in what is now the Springfield area ""were the most extensive, rich and beautiful of any which I have ever seen west of the Mississippi River.""
\
Three groups in Missouri work to preserve remnant prairies - the Conservation Department, the Department of Natural Resources and the citizens' Missouri Prairie Foundation.
\
And the national Nature Conservancy has bought 3,300 acres of native prairie in Missouri that it turned over to the Conservation Department for management.

Bird Survey Aid Sought
\
JEFFERSON CITY - The third year of the Missouri Breeding Bird Atlas is under way.
\
The mammoth project is a survey of 1,216 three-mile-square blocks throughout the state that will map the breeding ranges of the 160 to 170 species of birds known to nest in Missouri.
\
The project will be finished by 1990.
\
More than 200 volunteers are working on the atlas. They go afield during the nesting season, early and late, devoting from 15-20 hours to each block. Volunt eers should be able to identify 60 to 70 bird species.
\
It takes one field season to do a block. Besides identifying species, the observers record evidence that the birds are breeding.
\
""The first two field seasons already have produced some surprises,"" said Jim D. Wilson, ornithologist for the Conservation Department. ""For example, pine siskins and brown creepers, previously thought to be only migrants in Missouri, have been confirmed as nesters.""
\
Wilson says the breeding range of rare species, such as roadrunners, Swainson's hawks, Swainson's warblers, painted buntings and Bachman's sparrows, are being discovered.
\
The advance of the great-tailed grackle and house finch into Missouri also is being charted, and the researchers have found that western meadowlarks and western kingbirds are more widely distributed than was believed, while ranges of other birds, such as the grasshopper sparrow, have conspicuous gaps and sharp boundaries.
\
""Anyone who is interested in working on the Atlas project can contact me,"" Wilson said. ""Now is the time to get assigned to a block for the 1988 season.""
\
His address is: Jim D. Wilson, Department of Conservation, Box 180, Jefferson City 65102.

Conservationists Cited
\
JEFFERSON CITY - Four Missourians have been honored with the Chevron Conservation Award, a highly prestigious national award.
\
One is G. Andy Runge of Mexico, a former Conservation Commissioner and immediate past president of the Conservation Federation of Missouri, the state's largest citizen conservation group. Runge also has been president of the Missouri Prairie Foundation.
\
The other Missourians are Pat and Edward Jones Jr. of Williamsburg, jointly honored for forming a foundation that exposes underprivileged youth to conservation, and for contributing heavily to the proposed Katy hiking/biking trail; and Greg Iffrig of Springfield, a natural areas coordinator with the Department of Natural Resources, for developing the State Park Stewardship program.
\
The Chevron awards are to recognize individuals and organizations nationwide who preserve and protect the environment. The program is the oldest of its kind and ranks at the top in prestige.
\
Each of the 20 professional and citizen honorees and five non-profit organizations were recognized May 18 in Washington, D.C., and received $1,000 and a bronze plaque.
\
The awards have a long history. Ed Zern, famed outdoor writer, developed the idea of the awards on a fishing trip and was the first director, in 1954, with American Motors as sponsor. Gulf oil took over as sponsor in 1980 before Chevron picked up sponsorship when it acquired Gulf in 1986. Zern continues as director today.
\
Ken Sadler, retired wildlife biologist for the Conservation Department, was the last Missourian to be honored by Chevron, in 1986, in the professional category.
\
Missouri groups honored have included the St. Louis Council of State Garden Clubs, the Missouri Prairie Foundation, and the Conservation Federation of Missouri.
\
Individuals include Mrs. J. Russell Wilson, Doris Keefe, Dr. James Whitley, Charles Tryon, Harold Terreill, Ed Stegner, Robert H. Smith, John I. Rollings, Dr. William Pflieger, Carl Noren, Werner Nagel, Charles Hooker, Leo Drey, Clarence ""Salty"" Daniel, Ken Sadler, Richard O. Anderson, Elmore Seidler and Don Christisen.

Treescape Awards
\
JEFFERSON CITY - The Conservation Department is accepting applications for the 1988 Governor's Town Treescape Awards.
\
Each year, 12 awards are available for tree planting projects in Missouri communities, six for planting on municipal properties such as street rights-of-way, parks and public buildings, and six for land not city owned, including private property.
\
Categories include commerical, institutional, recreational, industrial, residential and governmental. Competition in both categories is on community size.
\
This year's applications are due a month earlier than those in the past, Aug. 1. For information, or to submit applications, communities should write to Gerald E. Ross, State Forester, Department of Conservation, Box 180, Jefferson City 65102.
\
The projects are judged on their contribution to the community, quality of planting and care, number of trees planted and size of trees used.
\
The winners will receive their awards in October.

(CNN) -- Australia has passed a controversial new law which will see the country's 500 most-polluting companies pay tax on their carbon emissions.
\
The Clean Energy Act was passed by 36 votes to 32 in the Australian Senate on Tuesday and will come into force on July 1 next year.
\
The legislation sees carbon taxed at a fixed price of 23 Australian dollars ($23.7) per ton for three years before moving to flexible pricing in 2015.
\
In a statement on the prime minister's official website, Julia Gillard described the vote as ""history-making"" and ""a major milestone in Australia's efforts to cut carbon pollution and seize the economic and job opportunities of the future.""
\
The legislation, which passed through Australia's House of Representatives by 74 votes to 72 in October, will deliver cuts in carbon pollution of at least 160 million tons a year in 2020, according to Gillard's website.
\
Nine out of 10 households will receive compensation to offset the expected rises in energy bills caused by the legislation, say the government.
\
This will take the form of a mixture of tax cuts and extra family benefits funded in part by the revenues the government collects from the businesses affected.
\
But opposition leader Tony Abbot, a staunch opponent of the legislation, called it ""a betrayal of the Australian people"" adding that three million Australian households will be worse off because of the tax.
\
""The longer this tax is in place, the worse the consequences for the economy, jobs and families. It will drive up the cost of living, threaten jobs and do nothing for the environment,"" Abbot, leader of the Liberal party in Australia said in a statement on his website.
\
Abbot also pledged to repeal the tax should he win the next general election scheduled to take place in 2013.
\
International mining group Rio Tinto, one of the companies which will be affected by the new law, believes it will hinder the country's competitiveness abroad.
\
""Australia's minerals sector now faces significant additional costs not faced by competitors. This will inevitably reduce potential investment and jobs growth in Australia, without reducing global emissions,"" David Peever, managing director of Rio Tinto Australia said in a statement earlier this year.
\
But the Australian Greens, whose support ensured Gillard's minority government won the vote, said the new law promised a greener future.
\
""Voting for a price on pollution is a vote for our ability to make a difference to climate change and provide a healthy, safe future for our kids and grandkids,"" Penny Wright, Australian Greens' Senator for South Australia, said in a statement.

The Missouri Public Service Commission has approved an agreement in a Kansas City Power & Light case that will enact a series of energy efficiency programs.
\
Several parties were included in the agreement, which falls under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act. They include the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council. The state's Office of the Public Counsel also filed a statement indicating it supports the agreement. The office is a separate agency that represents the public in matters before the commission.
\
Under the agreement, KCP&L will implement 12 programs that include income-eligible weatherization to assist residential customers in reducing energy usage and a home lighting rebate program. Customers also will be able to earn rebates for air conditioning upgrades and home appliance recycling, and can analyze their home energy use and receive home energy reports.
\
The eight residential and four business programs are expected to start in July.
\
Also, KCP&L will establish a charge on customers' bills to recover demand-side management program costs and incentives. The charge will appear as a separate line item on monthly electric bills starting this summer.
\
MEEIA was signed into law in 2009 and was enacted through a rule the commission approved in February 2011. Its design is to create new energy efficiency options that can help consumers cut down on the amount of energy consumed, reduce costs and help the environment.
\
KCP&L filed for the programs in January. The act allows all utilities in Missouri to offer energy efficiency programs to their customers.

Past ""living history"" recreations have included a drover's camp from the days when Missouri was a finish for trail drives. Plans this year are to have an Indian agent, Indians and cavalry.
\
Other recreations are a pioneer family camp and a fur trapper campsite.
\
Missouri once was one-third native tallgrass prairie, some 15 million acres. Now, less than 80,000 acres remain. Most Missourians have never seen the richness of an unplowed prairie, with its tall grasses and rich flowers.
\
Native prairie remains the only ecological community unprotected by a national park, such as the Flint Hills of Kansas.
\
Historically, such states as Illinois (nicknamed the Prairie State) and Iowa were almost all native prairie, but now are almost all farmland.
\
The explorer Joliet reported in 1673 that the prairie soil he found on his journey through Illinois and down the Mississippi River was rich and ready for cultivation.
\
It was that richness that doomed the native prairie. Grasses up to a dozen feet high fell before the settlers' plows.
\
In 1821, famed explorer Henry Rowe Schoolcraft wrote that the prairies in what is now the Springfield area ""were the most extensive, rich and beautiful of any which I have ever seen west of the Mississippi River.""
\
Three groups in Missouri work to preserve remnant prairies - the Conservation Department, the Department of Natural Resources and the citizens' Missouri Prairie Foundation.
\
And the national Nature Conservancy has bought 3,300 acres of native prairie in Missouri that it turned over to the Conservation Department for management.

Bird Survey Aid Sought
\
JEFFERSON CITY - The third year of the Missouri Breeding Bird Atlas is under way.
\
The mammoth project is a survey of 1,216 three-mile-square blocks throughout the state that will map the breeding ranges of the 160 to 170 species of birds known to nest in Missouri.
\
The project will be finished by 1990.
\
More than 200 volunteers are working on the atlas. They go afield during the nesting season, early and late, devoting from 15-20 hours to each block. Volunt eers should be able to identify 60 to 70 bird species.
\
It takes one field season to do a block. Besides identifying species, the observers record evidence that the birds are breeding.
\
""The first two field seasons already have produced some surprises,"" said Jim D. Wilson, ornithologist for the Conservation Department. ""For example, pine siskins and brown creepers, previously thought to be only migrants in Missouri, have been confirmed as nesters.""
\
Wilson says the breeding range of rare species, such as roadrunners, Swainson's hawks, Swainson's warblers, painted buntings and Bachman's sparrows, are being discovered.
\
The advance of the great-tailed grackle and house finch into Missouri also is being charted, and the researchers have found that western meadowlarks and western kingbirds are more widely distributed than was believed, while ranges of other birds, such as the grasshopper sparrow, have conspicuous gaps and sharp boundaries.
\
""Anyone who is interested in working on the Atlas project can contact me,"" Wilson said. ""Now is the time to get assigned to a block for the 1988 season.""

Conservationists Cited
\
JEFFERSON CITY - Four Missourians have been honored with the Chevron Conservation Award, a highly prestigious national award.
\
One is G. Andy Runge of Mexico, a former Conservation Commissioner and immediate past president of the Conservation Federation of Missouri, the state's largest citizen conservation group. Runge also has been president of the Missouri Prairie Foundation.
\
The other Missourians are Pat and Edward Jones Jr. of Williamsburg, jointly honored for forming a foundation that exposes underprivileged youth to conservation, and for contributing heavily to the proposed Katy hiking/biking trail; and Greg Iffrig of Springfield, a natural areas coordinator with the Department of Natural Resources, for developing the State Park Stewardship program.
\
The Chevron awards are to recognize individuals and organizations nationwide who preserve and protect the environment. The program is the oldest of its kind and ranks at the top in prestige.
\
Each of the 20 professional and citizen honorees and five non-profit organizations were recognized May 18 in Washington, D.C., and received $1,000 and a bronze plaque.
\
The awards have a long history. Ed Zern, famed outdoor writer, developed the idea of the awards on a fishing trip and was the first director, in 1954, with American Motors as sponsor. Gulf oil took over as sponsor in 1980 before Chevron picked up sponsorship when it acquired Gulf in 1986. Zern continues as director today.
\
Ken Sadler, retired wildlife biologist for the Conservation Department, was the last Missourian to be honored by Chevron, in 1986, in the professional category.
\
Missouri groups honored have included the St. Louis Council of State Garden Clubs, the Missouri Prairie Foundation, and the Conservation Federation of Missouri.
\
Individuals include Mrs. J. Russell Wilson, Doris Keefe, Dr. James Whitley, Charles Tryon, Harold Terreill, Ed Stegner, Robert H. Smith, John I. Rollings, Dr. William Pflieger, Carl Noren, Werner Nagel, Charles Hooker, Leo Drey, Clarence ""Salty"" Daniel, Ken Sadler, Richard O. Anderson, Elmore Seidler and Don Christisen.

151,"
(CNN) -- Australia has passed a controversial new law which will see the country's 500 most-polluting companies pay tax on their carbon emissions.
\
The Clean Energy Act was passed by 36 votes to 32 in the Australian Senate on Tuesday and will come into force on July 1 next year.
\
The legislation sees carbon taxed at a fixed price of 23 Australian dollars ($23.7) per ton for three years before moving to flexible pricing in 2015.
\
In a statement on the prime minister's official website, Julia Gillard described the vote as ""history-making"" and ""a major milestone in Australia's efforts to cut carbon pollution and seize the economic and job opportunities of the future.""
\
The legislation, which passed through Australia's House of Representatives by 74 votes to 72 in October, will deliver cuts in carbon pollution of at least 160 million tons a year in 2020, according to Gillard's website.
\
Nine out of 10 households will receive compensation to offset the expected rises in energy bills caused by the legislation, say the government.
\
This will take the form of a mixture of tax cuts and extra family benefits funded in part by the revenues the government collects from the businesses affected.
\
But opposition leader Tony Abbot, a staunch opponent of the legislation, called it ""a betrayal of the Australian people"" adding that three million Australian households will be worse off because of the tax.
\
""The longer this tax is in place, the worse the consequences for the economy, jobs and families. It will drive up the cost of living, threaten jobs and do nothing for the environment,"" Abbot, leader of the Liberal party in Australia said in a statement on his website.
\
Abbot also pledged to repeal the tax should he win the next general election scheduled to take place in 2013.
\
International mining group Rio Tinto, one of the companies which will be affected by the new law, believes it will hinder the country's competitiveness abroad.
\
""Australia's minerals sector now faces significant additional costs not faced by competitors. This will inevitably reduce potential investment and jobs growth in Australia, without reducing global emissions,"" David Peever, managing director of Rio Tinto Australia said in a statement earlier this year.
\
But the Australian Greens, whose support ensured Gillard's minority government won the vote, said the new law promised a greener future.
\
""Voting for a price on pollution is a vote for our ability to make a difference to climate change and provide a healthy, safe future for our kids and grandkids,"" Penny Wright, Australian Greens' Senator for South Australia, said in a statement.
"
152,"Response to threat of global warming\ When it comes to global warming, President George W. Bush's administration puts its faith in volunteerism and new energy technologies to scale back America's Everest of heat-trapping gases. But government studies say the results are at best uncertain.\ One thing is not: Each year, the mountain of ""greenhouse"" gases emitted by the United States grows bigger. While the rest of the developed world requires -- but isn't always achieving -- mandatory cuts in carbon dioxide and other emissions, the nation adding the most gases to the atmosphere is deadlocked in a debate over how to deal with it. Individual states, meanwhile, are taking the lead.\ Voluntary programs emphasized by Bush since 2002 are claimed to be sparing the atmosphere 300 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, or 4 percent of U.S. emissions.\ But the government doesn't know, and often can't verify, whether the reductions reported by 230 U.S. companies are real.\ Unverified results\ ""It's difficult to prove,"" said Paul McArdle, who manages the Energy Department's voluntary reporting system. ""It's my sense that some of these are real reductions.""\ What's more, McArdle acknowledged, companies can increase their emissions overall but still claim cuts -- by counting as reductions such steps as replacing old lighting, using more efficient vehicles or planting trees.\ In a review last April, Congress's Government Accountability Office questioned Washington's ability to monitor these voluntary efforts. ""Determining the reductions attributable to each program will be challenging,"" it said.\ In one program with measurable results, it estimated companies have reduced emissions by no more than one-half of 1 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution. Total U.S. emissions, now more than 7 billion metric tons a year, still are projected to rise 14 percent from 2002 to 2012.\ Carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels is the biggest of the greenhouse gases, so called because they produce a heat-trapping blanket when released into the atmosphere. Others are methane, nitrous oxide and synthetic gases. The atmosphere holds more carbon dioxide now than it has for hundreds of thousands of years, and the Earth's surface warmed an average of 1 degree in the past century.\ White House plan\ As a first step, the White House talks of reducing the ""intensity"" of U.S. carbon pollution -- not shrinking emissions overall, but reducing the carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic growth.\ ""Our objective is to significantly slow the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and, as the science justifies, stop it and then reverse it,"" said James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. ""We're making good progress. It's reasonably ambitious, but it still provides for reasonable human welfare.""\ Shortly after taking office, Bush rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which requires 36 industrial nations, by 2012, to cut global-warming gases by an average 5 percent below 1990 levels.\ He argued that cutting the U.S. share to less than 6 billion tons a year, as the treaty would have required, would have cost 5 million U.S. jobs. He objected, too, that such high-polluting developing nations as China and India are not required to reduce emissions.\ Calls for more action\ Some members of Congress agree with the gradualist Bush approach, whereas others do not, Republicans among them.\ ""Everybody's talking about it. What the American people want is for somebody to start doing something about it,"" complained Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., House Science Committee chairman.\ ""If we can't make a relatively simple change in (automobile) mileage regulations -- a change to an existing regulation that doesn't even require new technology and that would have numerous benefits aside from the climate implications -- then what does that say about our ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?"" Boehlert said. ""It certainly doesn't say anything good.""\ The United States is spending $3 billion each year researching technologies to cut global warming and $2 billion on climate research. In a program called the Asia-Pacific Partnership, Bush also is working with Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea - - producers of half the world's greenhouse gases -- to attract private money for cleaner energy technologies.\ Connaughton calls that joint effort a major breakthrough. Sen. Jim Jeffords calls it an ""excuse for further delay."" Jeffords, an independent from Vermont, is a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\ Bush envisions using more hydrogen-powered vehicles, electricity from renewable energy sources and clean coal technology.\ Government projects\ The Energy Department's technology program has helped build 34,000 new energy-efficient homes, and it plans to establish ""bioenergy"" research centers and to advance research into hydrogen fuel and fusion energy. Its director, Stephen Eule, promises breakthroughs in the coming decades.\ Scientists say climate disruptions might occur before that, however; and critics in Congress and elsewhere say the government effort is too slow and needs refocusing.\ The plan ""appears stalled near the starting line,"" said Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Ill., who heads a House subcommittee overseeing the program. A review in May by the Energy Department's research lab in Oak Ridge, Tenn., said the program focused too much on work that could lead to ""only incremental improvements."" It called for more emphasis on ""exploratory, out-of-the-box concepts.""\ ""There is a need for more high-risk but high-payoff research,"" the review concluded.\ A new government economic analysis sees markets in combination with research as the way to go. The Congressional Budget Office report last month said that any cost-effective U.S. policy on global warming must put a price on carbon -- via an emissions tax or a ""cap and trade"" system of buying and selling emissions allowances among companies, as in Europe.\ ""Setting a current price for carbon emissions and announcing planned future carbon prices not only would induce firms and households to change their behavior but also would increase their demand for technologies that would reduce emissions,"" congressional budget researchers said.\ Emissions caps\ Some businesses want national caps now on carbon emissions, believing them inevitable.\ ""It is very difficult to have a product that is regulated significantly differently from state to state,"" said Bill Gerwing, environmental policy director for the oil company BP America.\ Contributing to Washington's impasse is skepticism in some quarters about whether global warming is even a problem.\ The Senate Environment chairman, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., likens concerns about the Earth warming to Chicken Little saying the sky is falling.\ ""Global warming is an alarmism. It's a type of a hoax,"" said Inhofe. ""The reality is that a cap on carbon is a cap on the economy, through the rationing of energy.""\ Similar thinking pervades the House, Boehlert said. ""The scientific consensus has simply not pierced through the ideological barriers,"" he said.\ Former Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., who in 1988 led the first major legislative attempt to curb greenhouse gases, said next month's congressional elections could provide the ""most important push"" in the debate.\ In her current job of helping the Environmental Protection Agency recruit companies to cut carbon, she finds more shareholders viewing climate change as a top concern, she said.\ ""You've got the push of shareholders and eventually the pull of Congress moving America,"" Schneider said. ""We just need a new Congress.""\ Elements of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming\ GASES: Seeks to control emissions of six heat-trapping gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride. TARGETS: Assigns numerical targets for reducing or limiting emissions, compared with 1990 benchmark, for 36 industrialized countries among 140 nations that ratified the pact. The U.S. hasn't ratified it.\ TRADING: Allows emissions trading among the 36 countries. Industrial plants that emit less than allotted can sell resulting ""credits"" to those that exceed their allowances.\ JOINT IMPLEMENTATION: Allows nation to earn credits for financing emissions-reduction projects in another country subject to Kyoto controls.\ CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM: Allows country to earn credits via emission-reduction projects in developing nations, which are not obliged to cut emissions.\ THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"

One of President Obama's first priorities is development of a new energy policy aimed at lessening dependence on foreign oil and saving the environment. He and his Democrat minions want to tax carbon emissions. Instead, Republicans want to develop alternative sources of energy, mainly nuclear generation.
\
The cap-and-trade scheme promoted by Democrats would impose tax penalties on generators of carbon emissions. Tax credits could be bought and sold, aimed at costing polluters and benefiting cleaner producers. This would impose a burden on the overall economy, but would it reduce emissions?
\
Republicans instead would promote nuclear power, clearly the source with most potential to generate large volumes of energy without damage to the ozone. For the production of electrical energy a combination of nuclear power and cleaner coal is the one-two punch, using plentiful resources at our disposal. Even if Democrats want to penalize coal and oil burners they should still maximize the use of nuclear power, and government should do all it can to promote cleaner coal.
\
Environmentalists can be credited for good intentions but they expect far too much benefit from wind and solar power. Ethanol is losing favor for good reason, but politicians continue to yield to the farm lobby. Despite well known disadvantages, they actually talk about mandating an even larger mixture of ethanol in all the gasoline we buy. Some form of biomass might become feasible, but corn distillation is not it.
\
If nuclear is a great alternative for generating electrical power, no such magic bullet yet exists for motor fuel. The electric car becomes more promising but remains a marginal fix. We are intrigued with the idea of burning vegetable oil with emissions that smell like French fries. But all these alternatives are up against the immutable fact that the internal combustion engine powered by fossil fuel is far the most efficient.
\
As energy policies are developed in Washington, at least they should feature at the outset changes that will really work right away. So far, the only one is more nuclear generation.

Washington is doing something right. The House has just passed a comprehensive energy bill that represents a distinct step forward in energy policy in several respects. The Senate has already approved a similar version, so Congress is expected to agree shortly on a bill President Bush can sign.
\
To be sure, the bill has major flaws. It eliminates the current two-step process required to license new nuclear plants, combining them into a single construction and operation certification. This attempt to cut the time it takes to build new nuclear plants is no favor to those who rightly wish to hold the industry to the highest safety standards, which requires as many chances for public review as possible. Fortunately, major constraints on building new plants remain; the floodgates to nuclear power haven't been opened.
\
The bill also says nothing about higher auto-fuel efficiency standards, an unhappy omission. This was the price for refusing permission to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an important step in protecting the environment. But the bill does require that 10 percent of U.S. cars use alternative fuels by 2000 - 30 percent by 2010 - a key step in promoting electric cars. The bill gives battery technology a push. If workable units can be perfected, the whole environmental equation could change.
\
Other provisions are more mundane but still worthwhile. Utilities would get tax credits for using alternative fuels and developing conservation programs; small independent utilities are given access to utility transmission lines; and power producers would be allowed to operate plants in more than one state without added regulation. These steps would cut energy use, and consumer electrical bills.
\
Further, states are required to improve their building codes and are rewarded for using alternative power sources. Solar and renewable energy would be given tax incentives, moving the country toward more environmentally benign sources of energy. A gasoline or carbon dioxide emissions tax would have been better, but such a dramatic departure remains beyond the limits of the possible in Washington.
\
Still, the House energy bill shows that government isn't completely paralyzed, or incapable of rational action. Even if it takes too much time, government can, sometimes, produce good law and good policy. The energy bill is a modest example of both.

156,"VOTERS' GUIDE: MISSOURI PRIMARY ELECTION Reporter Phil Sutin: E-mail: psutin@post-dispatch.com Phone: 314-863-2812\ Missouri voters on Tuesday will consider raising taxes to inject about $483 million a year, for the next 10 years, into the state's transportation system.\ The Legislature has asked voters to approve Proposition B - a four-cent-a-gallon increase in the motor fuel tax and a half-cent increase in the state sales tax. The increases would end in 2013.\ Officials estimate that the tax in the first year would provide:\ * $364 million for state roads and bridges.\ * $61 million for public transit, Amtrak, general aviation airports and airports.\ * $52 million for county and municipal road work.\ * $6 million for subsidies for ethanol and biodiesel fuel.\ Officials estimate that the average Missouri motorist would pay an additional $30 a year in motor fuel taxes to the state, if the proposal passes.\ The buyer of a vehicle worth $20,000 would pay $100 more in sales taxes if the proposal passes. Estimating the cost to people who would not purchase a vehicle is difficult because spending circumstances and patterns vary. State transportation officials say the increase would cost a typical family of four $88 a year.\ State transportation officials say the increase would allow the state to spend $1.303 billion on roads and bridges a year for 10 years from all sources, state and federal.\ New projects\ The biggest chunk of total spending a year - $554 million - would go for new projects. Without added money from the tax increases, state spending on new projects, now assisted by bond issues, would shrink after 2003 to $160 million a year.\ Projects preserving roads and bridges other than interstate highways would receive $464 million a year; $110 million a year would go to work on existing interstate highways. The interstate money would pay for work such as resurfacing expressways, not major projects such as rebuilding Highway 40.\ Officials would use $75 million a year to retire $900 million in bonds issued in the past two years for state highway work. They would spend $20 million on road work connected with economic development opportunities.\ The Highway and Transportation Commission has listed major projects that the tax increases would help.\ Locally, the commission followed guidelines of the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council, the agency that schedules federal money for transportation projects in the region.\ State highway officials would seek places on the schedule, and they would have a final word about their requests after Gateway makes its decisions.\ Those projects are scattered across the region. Some projects are what highway officials consider critical, such as the rebuilding of Highway 40 (Interstate 64) from Sarah Street to Spoede Road, and the local portion for a new Mississippi River bridge in downtown St. Louis.\ Others are popular in various places around the region, such as:\ * Completing the rebuilding of Highway 21 as an expressway to Highway A in Jefferson County.\ * Relocating Highway 141 as a four-lane semi-expressway from Highway 40 to north of Olive Boulevard in west St. Louis County.\ * Upgrading two segments of Highway 40-61 so the entire stretch of that road in St. Charles County meets expressway standards.\ Outstate, the money would help complete long-standing efforts to provide modern, four-lane highway corridors.\ Among them are the upgrading of Highway 36 to four lanes from Hannibal to Macon in northern Missouri and two projects on Highway 60 to help complete a four-lane road across southern Missouri, from Springfield to Illinois.\ The estimate for new projects includes an inflation factor of 3 percent for the first five years and 4.5 percent for years six through 10 and a 15 percent reserve fund.\ Preservation\ The tax increase would boost yearly spending on preservation projects by 64 percent.\ State officials say the added money would allow them to do major work on 3,400 miles of roads and 700 bridges in 10 years. They say the increases could provide a light resurfacing of 14,000 miles of collector roads in 10 years.\ Most of the time, when motorists in the St. Louis area encounter construction delays on state roads, the state is trying to preserve them. Gateway gives the highest priority to keeping roads in good shape when it allocates federal money.\ The state rarely just rebuilds a road in place. It improves the design of the segment to help traffic move more smoothly. In some cases, a project adds shoulders.\ Counties and municipalities would receive additional money because their share of state transportation tax revenue is determined by formulas. The more money in the pot, the more money counties and municipalities would receive.\ St. Louis and St. Louis County would each receive nearly $3 million in additional money from the taxes.\ Mayor Francis Slay said the city would use its additional money to speed up major street and bridge projects that are largely financed by federal funds.\ St. Louis County Executive George ""Buzz"" Westfall said the county's new money would help implement more quickly a five-year plan to repair subdivision streets.\ Public transit\ More than half the money from the tax increases allocated to nonhighway modes of transportation would go to public transit, supporters of the tax proposal say. However, the law authorizing the election did not specify how the state would divide the money.\ Officials of the Bi-State Development Agency, which owns bus and MetroLink systems in St. Louis and St. Louis County, said the agency would receive $22 million a year from the tax increases.\ Larry Salci, the agency's executive director, has said the money would allow Bi-State to restore some service it cut last October and even provide a small expansion.\ Recently, Bi-State listed some restorations that the tax increases could finance. Changes could not occur before early next year, the agency said.\ Possibilities include increasing the frequency on such local lines as the Broadway, Cross County, Hampton and Manchester, and restoring or expanding evening service on such lines as the Chippewa and Grand, and extending hours of such express lines as the Ellisville, I-55 and New Halls Ferry.\ Bi-State could restore the Forest Park shuttle from May to September and absorb the Chesterfield Connector, a reverse commuting line now financed by the federal government.\ Bi-State said it could expand neighborhood service soon and after a MetroLink expansion opens in late 2005 or early 2006. The system could make changes to make sure that buses that service downtown remain on time.\ Exactly what Bi-State would do depends how potential changes fit into ag ency service standards and priorities and on decisions by the agency's commissioners, officials said.\ Salci also said the tax increases would not provide enough money for expanding MetroLink beyond the project from Forest Park to Shrewsbury.\ Other transportation\ Money from the tax increases could help maintain two Amtrak round trips a day between St. Louis and Kansas City. It could help the upgrading of railroad lines, so that passengers could go from St. Louis and Kansas City in about four hours, said Kevin Keith, the transportation department's chief engineer. The trains could go about 80 miles an hour.\ Rebuilding rail lines so trains could travel at 110 miles an hour, similar to high-speed service proposed for the East Coast, is too expensive, Keith said. That work could cost $1 billion, he said.\ Tax-increase money supporting general aviation could help increase by 25 percent the number of airports that could accept business jets. Among the airports that could be upgraded are those in St. Charles County and near Washington.\ Money for runway, lighting and navigation system improvements would go mainly to outstate airports. Money aimed at ports could help rehabilitate or repair docks in St. Louis. Otherwise most port money from the tax increases would go to outstate facilities.\ Fuel subsidies\ The tax proposal would provide up to about $6 million a year to subsidize ethanol and biodiesel production. Half the money would go into a fund for ethanol subsidies and half for bio-diesel subsidies.\ Each ethanol producer would receive 20 cents a gallon for the first 12.5 million gallons refined each year and five cents a gallon for the next 12.5 million gallons. Bio-diesel products would receive 30 cents a gallon, up to 15 million gallons.\ Farmer cooperatives operate ethanol plants in Macon, Mo., and Craig, Mo. Each plant has a capacity of 15 million gallons a year. The state has no bio-diesel plant.\ Ethanol plants process corn, and bio-diesel plants use soybeans.\ Dave Dillon, assistant director of the state agriculture department, said that as many as eight organizations are interested in building ethanol plants and as many as five are interested in building biodiesel plants.\ Dillon said subsidizing the plants is important for rural Missouri. The two ethanol plants ""keep a lot of farmers in business,"" he said. Each plant has no more than 15 workers, but the facilities add value to the corn grown by the facilities' farmer owners, he said.\ Ethanol and biodiesel help the environment because they are cleaner than regular gas and come from renewable sources, he said.\ Without the tax increases, ethanol and bio-diesel producers would have to depend on state general revenue for their subsidies. With the state going through budget cuts, the producers' chances of retaining subsidies would be questionable, Dillon said.\ The issues\ Supporters say that the state's transportation system will erode without added money and that the state's economy would suffer.\ ""Missouri's transportation system is broken and getting worse,"" a statement by the proposal's campaign committee said. ""Without immediate action, our roads and highways will suffer more damage and congestion, our bridges will further erode and our public transit systems will grow more crowded.""\ The supporters' campaign has stressed that the new tax money would improve traffic safety. But Keith, in a meeting with Post- Dispatch editorial writers, said improving road conditions is only one of three major factors in improving highway safety. The other two, he said, were law enforcement and education.\ The proposal does not guarantee that the Highway Patrol would receive any more money than the $120 million a year it now receives from the motor fuel tax. The Legislature would decide if the patrol would get more funds.\ Opponents are upset that a sales tax is part of the tax package. The move breaks the state's tradition of having users pay for the highways, mainly through the motor fuels tax.\ The sales-tax increase hurts people with low and moderate incomes because the tax affects more of the money they earn than richer people, opponents said.\ ""No highway users - neither trucks nor automobiles - will pay a fair share because two-thirds of the revenue from this tax increase will come from the sales tax, which is not based on highway use,"" said a statement by the opponents' campaign committee.\ Supporters say they cannot finance the nonhighway portions of the proposal without the sales tax. The state constitution limits the motor fuels tax to highway use, they said."

Senate Democrats conceded Monday that a temporary repeal of the 1993 gasoline tax increase was unavoidable.
\
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said the Senate could vote as soon as today on the tax cut, which he proposed less than two weeks ago. He plan ned to discuss the timing, as well as a Democratic proposal to raise the minimum wage, with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
\
""We think (it) is inevitable,"" Daschle said. Republicans are ""in the majority. They have the votes to pass legislation.""
\
The leading proposal for paying for the cut, according to House and Senate aides, is separate legislation that strengthens the government fund insuring savings and loan deposits. That plan requires a one-time premium payment from savings and loans, and, under budget rules, the money can be used to offset the tax cut. GOP leaders also are looking at a cut in Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's travel budget.
\
President Bill Clinton's administration supports the thrift legislation, and Daschle said he was ""not necessarily averse"" to using it to cut the gas tax.
\
Republican leaders are pushing hard for the repeal, which is seen as having wide popular appeal. Dole, R-Kan., Clinton's rival in the presidential race, has noted repeatedly that the tax increase was approved ""without a single Republican vote.""
\
Many Democrats are criticizing the tax cut, saying it could amount to a windfall for the oil companies who pay the tax and ultimately pass it on to the consumer. And environmentalists maintain that the tax cut would encourage more energy consumption and hurt the environment.
\
Repeal is ""attractive as a matter of raw politics, but it is terrible as a matter of public policy,"" said Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va. ""Just as we were beginning to make sustained progress in bringing down the deficit . . . we blink. We can't take the political heat.""
\
However, some Democrats feel compelled to vote for the tax cut, and Republicans are almost unanimously for it. Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, said Clinton wanted the tax cut considered as part of a balanced budget. But that does not mean that Clinton has decided to veto the tax cut.
\
""If it comes to us separately, we'll look at it separately,"" McCurry said. ""We would hope that the Congress would give equal priority treatment to raising the minimum wage.""
\
With gas prices having soared roughly 20 cents a gallon since February, Dole on April 26 proposed shaving the 1993 increase of 4.3 cents off the 18.3 cent federal gasoline tax.
\
Dole suggested that the Senate should act today, which marks what the private, business-financed Tax Foundation has called Tax Freedom Day. That's the date, according to its calculation, by which the average taxpayer has earned enough money to pay federal, state and local taxes for the year.
\
It would be a ""good day to pass the gas-tax repeal. It seems to me it might have a nice ring to it,"" Dole said.
\
The cut would begin in mid-May or the start of June and end on Dec. 31. Republicans hope to make it permanent as part of the 1997 fiscal year budget.
\
On Sunday, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, suggested on NBC's ""Meet The Press"" that the cut could be offset by wringing waste from education programs. Democrats denounced the suggestion, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said Monday, ""I don't think that will happen.""
\
Asked what he thought Armey was up to with his comments, Gingrich said: ""I don't have a clue. I didn't watch the show, and I don't know what the context was.""
\
Thrifts do not mind their money being used for the tax cut because the deposit insurance measure also would require commercial banks to share the cost of paying off S&L bailout bonds sold by the government in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
\
""The money . . . is going to be used for one reason or another,"" said Bob Davis, government relations director of America's Community Bankers, the S&L trade group. ""This seems to me to be a marriage made in heaven.""

This is a second in a series of where presidential candidates stand on the issues.
\
""We are not building this country of ours for a day. It has to last through the ages.""
\
PRESIDENT Theodore Roosevelt uttered those words shortly after emerging from four days in the northern California woods with Sierra Club founder John Muir in 1903.
\
Arguably the nation's first environmental president, Roosevelt - in two terms as chief executive - quadrupled the size of the national forest system, doubled the number of national parks and designated 16 new national monuments, including the Grand Canyon.
\
With problems like pollution, population growth and global warming, environmental issues have become far more complex than they were at the turn of the century.
\
But that hasn't stopped the presidential candidates from claiming to carry on the environmental legacy of Roosevelt.
\
""George Bush has achieved a strong environmental record, worthy of the tradition established by Theodore Roosevelt,"" said James Strock, co-chair of the Environmental Coalition for Bush-Quayle '92.
\
""Across the board - from the new Clean Air Act to the new Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary, from vigorous law enforcement to international trade and technology development - the president has earned the support of all who care about the environment,"" Strock said.
\
Not so, says Reid Wilson, political director of the Sierra Club.
\
""We believe that President Bush has completely failed to live up to his {1988} promise to be the 'environmental president,' "" Wilson said.
\
In contrast, Wilson contends, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton has a strong environmental record and proposals more deserving of the Roosevelt label.
\
The Sierra Club has endorsed Clinton for president, only the second time in it's 100-year history that it has backed a presidential candidate.
\
Clinton also has the support of the League of Conservation Voters.
\
The league is the political arm of the nation's major environmental and conservation groups.
\
But many critics of Clinton say that, as governor of Arkansas, he often opted for jobs over measures to limit pollution.
\
Compared with Bush and Clinton, independent candidate Ross Perot has said little about the environment.
\
He made a few general statements on the issue in his campaign book, ""United We Stand.""
\
""When we pollute our air and contaminate our water, waste our energy resources and destroy our wilderness and wildlife, we squander our national wealth,"" Perot wrote.
\
Environmentalists know little about Perot. But what they do know ""is not at all reassuring,"" said Brooks Yeager of Environmentalists for Clinton-Gore.
\
Perot showed contempt for the environment when he blew up a coral reef to make it easier to get his yacht close to his Bermuda vacation home, Yeager and others said. And a corporation he owned bulldozed bird nests on land it planned to develop - just before the bird was officially listed as a threatened species, they said.
\
Pervading all the political arguments this year is the oft-voiced fear that - in the short run, at least - strong measures to preserve the environment may cost jobs at a time the nation can ill afford to lose them. No. 2 Spot Important
\
Advocates for Clinton and Bush say that where they stand on the environment is made even clearer by the major-party choices for vice president.
\
Environmentalists denounce Vice President Dan Quayle for leading what they call the environment-busting White House Council on Competitiveness. The council has blocked many environmental protection efforts, saying that they stunt economic growth. On the other hand, Quayle's record has drawn applause from people who put the need short-term economic gains over environmental concerns.
\
Environmentalists praise Gore's voting record and his book, ""Earth in the Balance."" The book outlines Gore's views on global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and other threats.
\
""We cannot stick our heads in the sand and pretend we are not facing a global environmental crisis,"" Gore wrote.
\
A different view is held by Mary Gade, director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the other co-chair of the coalition that supports Bush and Quayle. Gore's ""radical proposals"" on the environment would ""cost Americans millions of jobs and billions of dollars in new taxes,"" Gade said.
\
Here's a look at the candidates' records and platforms on a few major environmental issues. Endangered Species
\
The 1973 Endangered Species Act, considered by many to be the crown jewel of U.S. environmental law, is due for action next year, experts say. At issue is whether the act should be changed to emphasize economic development or to strengthen environmental protections.
\
On the endangered northern spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest, Bush blames efforts to save the owl for job loss in the timber industry.
\
In May, a special committee convened by the administration voted to override the Endangered Species Act and allow logging that would threaten the owl with extinction. Such activity is still blocked in court.
\
""The time has come to talk sensibly,"" the president told a crowd last month at a campaign stop in the logging town of Colville, Wash. ""When hundreds of mills have been shut down, thousands of timber workers thrown out of work and revenues for schools and other local services have been slashed, the balance has been lost.""
\
Clinton says that the choice between endangered species and jobs is a false conflict and that a healthy environment is the foundation for economic growth.
\
Clinton says the Endangered Species Act should not be weakened and that old-growth forest protection must be a top conservation priority. He favors giving federal aid to timber-dependent communities to help them diversify their economies.
\
Perot has said little on the Endangered Species Act and the old-growth forest issue.
\
In his book, he says he supports environmentally ""sustainable"" economic growth, meaning that natural resources should not be depleted. Federal subsidies for the ""inefficient, environmentally destructive activities in the mining and timber industries"" should be eliminated, Perot wrote. Pollution
\
During the 1988 campaign, Bush promised a new Clean Air Act. In 1990, it became law. Under the act, acid rain will be cut in half and air toxics reduced by more than three-fourths. Virtually all American cities will enjoy cleaner air by the end of the century, the administration says.
\
Environmentalists give Bush credit for breaking a 10-year stalemate to get the act passed. But they accuse Quayle's Council on Competitiveness of stalling and weakening its provisions.
\
A confidential U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report, leaked to the press in September, said the White House was stalling 76 new environmental regulations.
\
The regulations - prepared by the EPA - include some of the major provisions of the Clear Air Act that deal with controlling smog, protecting the ozone layer and cutting acid rain and toxic air pollutants.
\
The administration boasts that the EPA in four years under Bush has been more aggressive than ever at stopping pollution of the air, water and land. The EPA collected more fines and secured more prison sentences for violators than had been won in the previous 18 years, officials say.
\
But that, environmentalists counter, is not so much because of administration activism; they say it is because of expanded enforcement authority granted by the 1986 Clean Water Act.
\
Bush charges that Clinton has done little to stem pollution from the Arkansas poultry and paper industries.
\
The Bush campaign cites a study done by the Institute for Southern Studies in Durham, N.C. The study shows that Arkansas ranks ninth worst in the nation in percentage of polluted rivers and streams, fourth worst per capita in toxic chemical releases to surface water and 43rd per capita in spending on air pollution.
\
But an author of the study said Bush was distorting the figures. Southern states have traditionally ranked poorly on such issues, said the author, Bob Hall. Energy
\
Bush says U.S. energy strategy should emphasize construction of new nuclear power plants and oil drilling in what environmentalists say are sensitive wildlife areas, such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
\
Bush declared a halt to offshore oil and gas development until after the year 2000 for much of the East and West Coasts.
\
Clinton proposes tax incentives for development of renewable energy sources like solar power. The current tax structure is slanted to benefit traditional energy sources, he and Gore wrote in their campaign statement, ""Putting People First.""
\
Clinton also proposes incentives to reward energy efficiency and conservation.
\
Clinton wants to raise auto fuel-efficiency standards to 40 miles per gallon by the year 2000 and to 45 miles per gallon by 2015.
\
Bush says such an increase would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.
\
Perot proposes a 10-cent annual gas tax hike for each of the next five years, to raise money to counter the national debt and also cut pollution.
\
Global Environment
\
Bush accelerated the U.S. commitment to phase out the use of ozone-destroying chemicals, after new scientific evidence was reported earlier this year about the depletion of the ozone layer. The layer protects life on the planet from the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays from the sun.
\
But environmentalists blasted Bush for what they saw as the president's failure to lead on key issues at this summer's Earth Summit in Brazil.
\
Bush refused to sign a climate-change treaty, which included specific requirements to reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions to head off global warming. All other industrial nations had agreed to limit emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
\
Clinton says global warming presents a major threat to the nation and argues that Bush has ignored it. Clinton wants to reduce U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions by the year 2000 to their 1990 levels.
\
Bush refused also to sign a ""biodiversity"" protection treaty at the Earth Summit. The treaty would have conserved hundreds of millions of acres of tropical forests and the species and genetic wealth in them.
\
Bush said the treaty failed to give adequate patent protection for U.S. biotechnology companies. Wetlands
\
Wetlands are nature's sponges. They include swamps, marshes and bogs. They help control floods, filter pollution and support migrating bird species and other wildlife.
\
Environmentalists have accused Bush of breaking his 1988 campaign promise for ""no net loss"" of the nation's wetlands. Last year, the administration revised its definition for a wetland, aiming to open more land for farming and development.
\
The proposal would eliminate protection for up to 40 million of the 100 million acres of wetlands that remain in the lower 48 states, said the League of Conservation Voters.
\
Clinton says he supports ""no net loss"" of wetlands.

ST. LOUIS -- An Environmental Protection Agency official warned Wednesday that local industries may face higher costs and federal highway dollars could be cut if Gov. Mike Parson approves legislation to end vehicle emission testing in three St. Louis-area counties.\Jed Wolkins, who leads the EPA region's auto emissions program, told the board of the East-West Gateway Council of Governments that the federal government's first sanctions would take effect 18 months after regulators determine the region is no longer in compliance. That process, he said, could begin as early as next month if Parson signs the bill to end testing requirements in St. Charles, Jefferson and Franklin counties.\The initial sanctions would hit power plants and industrial sources such as factories or large breweries that seek emission permits to expand or build new facilities, he said. Under the federal penalties, the industrial sources would be required to obtain 2 pounds of pollution offsets for every new pound of pollution emitted.\""It doubles, basically, the amount of emission reductions they have to buy from someone else,"" Wolkins said. ""And that makes economic development harder.""\If the region doesn't regain compliance, six months after those initial penalties, federal highway matching funds for the region's road projects would be imperiled. The sanctions would not affect Illinois counties in the metro area, Wolkins said. But East-West Gateway Executive Director Jim Wild pointed to 390 projects on the Missouri side of the region with a $1.6 billion price tag planned into 2025 that could see their federal funding hit.\""It could be very impactful if this goes through,"" Wild said.\East-West Gateway officials are looking at reformulating their air modeling in order to try and keep the region in federal compliance.\""It's really just trying to manage risk at this point,"" Wild said.\Republican lawmakers who represent St. Louis suburbs have supported ending the emissions tests for years. Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, who pushed the measure this year, said during debate this spring that he didn't expect the EPA to take any action against the state. Senate Majority Leader Dave Schatz, who represents much of Franklin County, also said this year he was ""ready to call their bluff.""\Franklin County Presiding Commissioner Tim Brinker, who sits on the board, said the emission testing was an ""encumbrance"" on his residents' ""pocketbooks"" and ""daily lives.""\""Quite frankly, the constituents of our three counties are in favor of this legislation,"" he said.\St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, also a member of the board, warned the region could be testing the federal government just as ""the biggest infusion of capital in a generation"" becomes available. ""I'm really not being interested in being on a list of communities"" out of compliance with federal environmental rules while St. Louis competes for potential federal dollars should Congress pass a major infrastructure bill, Page said.\Parson has generally been a strong proponent of highway funding, backing the state's first increase in the gas tax in years -- a bill that also awaits his signature -- over the objections of the more anti-tax wing of his party. But it was unclear whether he would sign the emission testing measure. His spokeswoman said Wednesday the bill was still ""under a thorough review.""\The chair of the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission and director of the Missouri Department of Transportation sent Parson a letter June 14 saying the bill's measure ending emission testing was ""objectionable."" And Jason Hall, CEO of the region's business group Greater St. Louis Inc., penned a letter to the governor warning the loss of federal highway funds would be ""devastating"" for St. Louis.\""The St. Louis region has established itself as a global transportation and logistics hub, and it is imperative that we continue to invest in the region's multimodal freight infrastructure to strengthen our global advantage,"" Hall wrote.\St. Louis is the only Missouri metro area with a vehicle emission testing program, put into place more than 35 years ago as one piece of a regional strategy to reduce harmful ozone as required by the Federal Clean Air Act. Ozone, which exacerbates respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and is especially harmful to children, older people and outdoor workers, is created when pollution from cars, factories and power plants bakes in the sun during the hot summer months.\Regional ozone pollution has improved over the years, from more than a month of high-ozone days in the mid 2000s to fewer than 20 days per year since 2013, according to EPA data. Still, monitors that often record some of the highest pollution levels are located in Jefferson and St. Charles counties, according to state air monitoring data, though those monitors are closer to coal power plants that also contribute to ozone pollution.\CREDIT: BY JACOB BARKER , St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
160," As an elected official in Ste. Genevieve County, I understand the importance of keeping the air in St. Louis clean. It does not help anyone in Missouri if St. Louis' pollution problems keep the state's economy from growing.\ But a ""no growth"" policy is exactly what the your editorial writers are advocating when you oppose the building of Holcim's cement plant in our county (Dec. 27 editorial).\ Ste. Genevieve County did not create the St. Louis pollution problem. And studies show that, even after the Holcim plant is operating, the facility will not hurt the air quality in the St. Louis region. But the plant will have a significant, positive impact on our schools and the economy in our area, which has been hard hit by the loss of manufacturing jobs over time.\ I know that state environmental regulators have been reviewing Holcim's plans for many months. I also know that they are obligated to make sure the plant uses the best available technology to reduce emissions. That is why I am confident that Ste. Genevieve County will be able to create hundreds of jobs at the Holcim plant, while the St. Louis region works to clear its air.\ Albert Fults\ Presiding Commissioner\ Ste. Genevieve County\ Ste. Genevieve\ ===\ Keep the air clean\ Thank you for the Dec. 27 editorial exposing the problem with air pollution that will grow worse if the big cement factory is built south of St. Louis without proper clean-air technology.\ My wife and several friends of ours seriously suffer from air pollution already, and we are extremely concerned about the prospect of still worse pollution. Please keep this issue before the public and do whatever you can to prevent the current plans from going forward.\ James C. Pakala\ Manchester\ ===\ Non-union project\ I'm appalled at the latest Wal-Mart venture into the St. Louis area. Specifically, I'm referring to the ""super center"" that is to be constructed in Warrenton.\ This store is going to be built by non-union labor. Once again Wal-Mart has shown its true colors as a mega-retailer with no regard for the area it serves.\ The construction industry in St. Louis, except for housing, is suffering through a downturn. Many highly trained, professional craftsmen are out of work. With westward expansion of the St. Louis region, many of these union craftsmen live in the St. Charles- Warren County area.\ I have no doubt that many of the people employed on the Wal-Mart project will be from out of state, or sending their paychecks home and not spending them in the Warrenton area. I'm also sure the wages and benefits paid to these people will be far below those established in this area.\ True, there will be jobs created when this store opens, but they will be filled by many part-time workers with few or no benefits.\ The city of Warrenton will receive much needed tax dollars from the retail sales. However, the city could receive even more in the long run by employing people from this area when building.\ Douglas A. Beaver\ Member IBEW Local #1\ Dardenne Prairie\ ===\ No tolls, please\ Sen. John Loudon's proposal for toll roads in Missouri is a retrogressive idea that needs to be dismissed quickly.\ Aside from the inevitable delays at toll plazas - even with a high-tech collection system - a separate expensive toll collection and administrative infrastructure would have to be established that would require the hiring of many new workers.\ Obtaining additional revenue for roads can be accomplished simply by raising the gasoline tax, which does not require any new bureaucratic infrastructure set-up.\ Additonally, raising the gas tax would ensure that the heavier gas-guzzler vehicles would pay a higher percentage of the roadway costs. And out-of-state visitors would be paying for road usage when they purchase gas in our state.\ Eugene A. Degenhardt\ Oakville\ ===\ Sen. John Loudon thinks toll roads are a solution and compares them to a privately funded bridge at the Lake of the Ozarks. Does that mean he's going to let private enterprises build new roads and let them charge tolls? Fine with me. Just don't let any of our tax money get involved.\ I don't like toll roads. A few more cents on the gasoline tax is a thousand times more logical than toll roads.\ If the people of Missouri don't want an increased gas tax, then cut back on road maintenance. We should get what we pay for.\ I know the people voted down a gas tax, but they also voted down concealed weapons. So maybe our legislators could disregard the people's will again and vote in the gas tax.\ Let's just put it this way. You'll get my toll road dime when you pry it from my cold dead hands!\ Mike Svoboda\ Sunset Hills\ ===\ A charter success\ A Dec. 17 Jerry Berger column printed excerpts of a leaked St. Louis Public Schools memo indicating that the city's charter schools have performed no better - and in some cases worse than - other schools. However, the excerpt (and perhaps the memo itself) failed to acknowledge charter school success stories, such as the ones taking place at Confluence Academy, a new public charter school in the Old North St. Louis neighborhood.\ While some of the city's charters may have produced sub-par results, Confluence Academy's students have not yet taken the MAP tests that are given each spring to all of the state's pupils.\ In the meantime, there is much to be proud of at Confluence. Our first graders are learning to speak Spanish, the school's choir has performed throughout the St. Louis area, and during a visit recently, Mayor Slay praised the school's positive learning environment. This atmosphere has helped our students consistently surpass monthly benchmarks that are set in-house to gauge progress in each area of the core curriculum.\ The performance recorded thus far suggests that Confluence students will indeed outperform the city averages when tests are administered next spring.\ Confluence is taking seriously its mission to offer a rigorous academic program. And according to recent surveys of the school's families, parents appear to be quite pleased with the results thus far.\ To say that St. Louis' charter schools are failing is to turn a blind eye to the success at Confluence.\ Jeff Smith\ Co-Founder and Board Member\ Confluence Academy\ St. Louis\ ===\ Highway in the dark\ The stretch of Lindbergh Boulevard from Interstate 70 north to McDonnell Boulevard has been under reconstruction for over a year. The designers took the once rather straight road and added several curves to it. Before the latest construction, this area of highway received some light from the old Henry VIII motel and other small businesses along the roadside. All these places have been torn down. This section of road is very dangerous, dark and poorly marked. Travel on this highway at night or in rain or snow is treacherous.\ I call on the Highway Department and St. Louis County to remedy this situation before serious and fatal accidents happen. Please add some light to this one-mile stretch. With the slowdown at Lambert, the renovations of Lindbergh will slow down too. It could be several years before the final roadway construction is complete. This is too long to wait for safety.\ Marian Bauer\ Florissant\ ===\ Plutocrats in charge\ Contrary to what conservatives like Carl T. Schroeder II may think (Dec. 26 letter), the Democrats have good reason to despair over the direction in which we are being led. And if this ever was ""the greatest country in the world"" that Schroeder avers, it is manifestly that no longer. Thanks to the Republicans in general and the Bushies in particular, it is now the greatest plutocracy in the world, one with the best government money can buy.\ Travis Kidd\ Chester, Ill."
161,"COMMENTARY Catherine Hanaway, R-Warson Woods, is minority floor leader of the Missouri House.\ MISSOURI ROADS\ Missouri's roads are in disrepair and our transportation system must be expanded. Investment in a better transportation system, if well spent, will make our roads safer and enhance economic development.\ These facts would seem to argue for the governor's proposed tax increase for transportation, which has been passed by the Missouri House of Representatives. The problem is that Missouri has a highway history fraught with broken promises, mismanagement and a complete lack of accountability.\ Taxpayers were hit with a 6-cents-a-gallon fuel tax increase in 1992 for highways. Extensive promises were made then about roads to be built. Today, despite the fact that gasoline tax revenues have come in more than 30 percent higher than projected, just 25 percent of all the promised projects have been built.\ We need better roads, but first we must ensure that the highway department will spend our money well. Currently, the major transportation decisions are made by a six-member commission, appointed by the governor, to six-year terms. This commission answers to no one. Its members are not elected, and more important, they cannot be removed.\ Several proposals are on the table to transform the governance of our transportation system so that someone ultimately must answer to the taxpayers. We must adopt one of these good ideas so that when the job is not getting done someone will be held accountable.\ We cannot possibly ask the taxpayers for more of their money before we get our own house in order. Yet, the governor wants to do just that. He wants $747 million more of taxpayer money every year -- the largest tax increase in Missouri history. His plan would be for a 3/4-cent increase in sales tax, a 3-cent increase in the gasoline tax and a 33 percent increase in motor vehicle registration fees.\ Compounding the problem of a lack of accountability is the economic environment in which the governor asks for this tax increase. Our economy is slowing. Congress is considering a tax cut to stimulate the economy and avoid a recession. Missouri's economy is slowing as well, as evidenced by state income tax revenue collections coming in well below projections. The governor has enticed some large corporate groups to support his tax increase, but they might feel differently if the tax revenue were coming from an increase in the corporate franchise tax.\ In any economic downturn, a tax hike is dangerous. This, however, is the worst kind of tax increase, because it's regressive. Most of the money generated by the governor's tax increases, approximately $553 million, will be generated from a state sales tax increase from a rate of 4 percent to 4.75 percent. Although it also raises the sales tax on motor vehicles, this is not a tax increase that simply discriminates against car owners. It is a regressive tax on retail sales that hurts the poor the most, who are also the first to be adversely affected by the slowing economy. The proposal also increases the gas tax by 3 cents a gallon (to a total of 20 cents per gallon) and raises vehicle registration fees by one-third.\ In other words, let's fatten up the most inefficient department in state government by placing the burden on the littlest guys in the marketplace.\ The governor has argued that all he wants to do is give the people a chance to vote. The problem is that the people are likely to vote no. A public outcry against a transportation measure, like this one, placed on the ballot would make passage of a more sensible plan harder to accomplish in the future.\ The governor has succeeded in getting a $747 million tax hike through the Missouri House without accountability measures and without a highway plan. If he gets his way, MoDOT will have a new pot of the taxpayers' money and no promises to break.\ We need a better plan. With better timing, more accountability and less regressive taxation, we will get better, safer roads."
162,"Call it the pothole penalty. That's the injuries, lost lives and $241 a year each Missouri motorist pays due to congressional inaction on passing a new highway bill. And until Congress acts, the pothole penalty is going to get worse.\Federal transportation officials predict money from the Highway Trust Fund, which provides the largest share of state and local resources for roads, will begin to dry up this summer. Without congressional action, the fund will cease dispersing money on Oct. 1.\In Missouri, the crunch has already begun. In anticipation of the impending crisis, the state Highway Commission has halted all new projects. For our states and states across the country, it couldn't come at a worse time.\The average bridge in the U.S. is 45 years old, dangerously close to the average lifespan of 50 years. A fourth of bridges are deficient or obsolete. In fact, while absent the publicity of the Interstate 35 bridge collapse in Minnesota or the Interstate 5 collapse in Washington, an average of 25 bridges a year collapse in the U.S.\In addition to deaths, injuries and serious infrastructure failure, the neglect by Congress interrupts our daily lives and costs every motorist. According to the transportation research firm TRIP, poor road conditions contribute to a third of traffic fatalities. A fourth of roads in Missouri have serious surface deficiencies, which likely contribute to the 800-900 traffic fatalities a year, in addition to the $241 a year in damage to cars.\Lack of action threatens serious economic damage as well. The construction industry remains fragile from the Great Recession, which sent unemployment rates soaring to above 25 percent for construction workers. Should transportation construction slow or come to a halt, economists predict the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. On the other hand, if Congress finds the courage to act and passes a strong, long-term highway bill, experts say 2 million jobs a year could be created.\No one, including members of Congress, should be surprised that we find ourselves on the verge of a crisis. The 18.4-cents-a-gallon gas tax, which goes entirely to transportation projects through the Highway Trust Fund, has not been adjusted for 21 years. Since that time, the value of the gas tax has declined by about 40 percent as construction materials costs have risen and new vehicles use less fuel.\There are many options to provide resources to stop our critical transportation infrastructure from crumbling, ranging from public-private partnerships to alternatives to the gas tax. But none have been tested or can provide the needed resources any time soon. Congress should recognize the crisis and reach for the tested and reliable solution and right now that is an adjustment to the gas tax, which has provided a dedicated stream of transportation investments for generations.\While adjusting the gas tax creates tremors of trepidation for many in Congress, some representatives have taken up the call. For example, Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., has filed a bill that would increase the tax by 15 cents over three years, adjust it to inflation and after 10 years the tax would sunset. That would allow policy-makers and elected leaders the time needed to develop alternative resources. Those three nickels would entirely bridge the gap for the trust fund, and prevent deficit spending to shore up the fund.\Despite the fears of many elected leaders, raising the gas tax and adjusting it for inflation won't cost them their jobs. Public opinion surveys consistently show that if funds go for their intended purpose of fixing potholes, roads and bridges, strong majorities will support it. In fact, the most recent survey by the Mineta Transportation Institute shows 67 percent of Americans would back an increase under those conditions.\A 15-cent adjustment to the gas tax has won the support of LIUNA in part because construction workers' jobs depend on it, but also because our families depend on a safe transportation system just like everyone else. Organizational support for securing the Highway Trust Fund with a 15-cent increase is as broad as public support groups from the AAA to the Chamber of Commerce support it.\For too long Congress has adopted a duct-tape approach to transportation infrastructure investment, leaving the rest of us with a pothole penalty. Congress should get in line with the public and take the logical first step to prevent more loss of life and further decline of our roads and bridges by passing a modest increase in the gas tax.\Gary Elliott is LIUNA's business manager for the Eastern Missouri Laborers' District Council, representing 7,500 members in eastern Missouri, with the responsibility to ensure a safe working environment, deliver a skilled workforce and ensure all labor laws are followed."
163,"COMMENTARY: A FORUM FOR OTHER VOICES, IDEAS AND OPINIONS John H. Skinner is executive director and chief executive of the Solid Waste Management Association of North America.\ ENERGY\ * St. Louisans should urge Congress to reinstate tax credit that makes landfill-gas projects possible.\ Americans create a lot of trash, although according to Environmental Protection Association data, our solid waste continues to increase primarily because the population is increasing, not because we are inherently more wasteful. Even though landfilled solid waste decreased 9 percent from 1990 to 2000, eventually we may run out of places to dump it.\ To solve this dilemma, we need to figure out the most environmentally and economically sound way to reduce waste, increase the recovery of energy from waste and recycle materials, while being mindful of technical, economic and budgetary constraints.\ This week, the 7,000-member Solid Waste Management Association of North America is meeting in St. Louis to discuss removing barriers to and providing incentives for achieving higher levels of solid waste reduction and recovery.\ St. Louis is an innovator in solid waste management. One creative project is a landfill-gas-to-energy initiative that represents the wave of the future in waste management. Some years ago, Pattonville High School students interested in preserving the environment approached the Fred Weber, Inc., construction firm and asked if it would be possible to use the gas produced by one of the company's landfills to fire the school's hot water boilers. It was, and now the program saves the school an estimated $35,000 per year while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Landfill-gas projects like this one are a promising renewable energy supply that will reduce our dependence on imported oil. They also are an environmentally sound, reliable and cost-effective method of producing power.\ Unfortunately, a federal landfill gas tax credit that financed many projects in the 1990s expired in 1998. Although EPA has identified 600 additional such projects, initiating them depends on reinstating the landfill gas tax credit. If these 600 new landfill- gas projects were combined with the 360 already operating, we estimate that we could reduce greenhouse gases by 8 to 10 percent, a target set by the Kyoto protocol, by voluntary means and without regulation.\ Today, there is a bill pending in Congress that includes these landfill gas tax credits as part of our national energy strategy. To lessen energy dependence and improve our management of solid waste, it is crucial that St. Louis area voters tell their elected officials that they support the passage of tax credits in the energy bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this year.\ On behalf of SWANA, I thank St. Louis for its hospitality and urge its citizens to act today to help us ensure our future energy sources while reducing solid waste."

PHILADELPHIA
\
FOR EARTH DAY, the environment became an issue in the presidential campaign, with President George Bush and Democrats Bill Clinton and Jerry Brown touting their environmental records Wednesday and questioning the green credentials of their rivals.
\
Clinton made a wide-ranging attack on Bush, charging that ""presidential leadership on the environment has become an endangered species"" and criticizing Bush's policies on global warming, preservation of wetlands, oil drilling in the Arctic and energy conservation.
\
A spokesman for Bush responded by charging that Arkansas under Gov. Clinton's leadership had the worst environmental record of any state in the country. That theme also was sounded by Brown, who warned that if Clinton is the Democratic nominee, environmentally conscious voters would support independent H. Ross Perot as part of an ""environmental backlash.""
\
In a speech at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Clinton called for higher fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles, an increase in the reliance on natural gas, tax policies that would reward conservation and punish ""energy wasters,"" and national legislation to promote recycling by requiring deposits on bottles throughout the country.
\
Clinton was especially tough in criticizing Bush's hesitancy in making a commitment to attend a summit meeting in June on global warming and other environmental issues to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
\
""Nearly a hundred heads of state have already firmly committed to attend,"" Clinton said. ""But just Wednesday, the president said he simply couldn't decide whether to go or not. We've seen eight of the hottest years in the history of our planet in the last decade. . . . And the leaders of nearly every nation on earth are waiting while the president of the United States makes up his mind on whether to act.""
\
To applause, Clinton added: ""I think this is one foreign trip President Bush can't afford to miss.""
\
Clinton admitted that to help his state he had made trade-offs in favor of employment over the environment. ""In that context, I've made the choice from time to time for jobs because my state was a poor one, without either enough jobs or enough federal help to clean up the environment,"" Clinton said.
\
""But over the years, as I have worked in this area, I have come to learn something that George Bush and his advisers still don't understand: I've come to reject the false choice between economic growth and environmental protection.""
\
Michael R. Deland, chairman of the president's Council on Environmental Quality, said that Clinton's ""slippery attempt on Earth Day to gloss over his record gives new meaning to the words oil slick.""
\
Deland said the Bush administration's accomplishments - including reauthorization of the Clean Air Act, proposals to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals and a freeze on offshore oil and gas drilling - ""represent a lifetime commitment to environmental protection.""
\
Brown spoke to an Earth Day rally on the Washington Mall, and he urged the Democratic Party to ""take the lead"" in protecting the environment and making the United States more energy-efficient and independent.
\
""Don't tell me the deficit's too big,"" Brown said. "". . . it shouldn't stand in the way for energy efficiency, human health, protecting the environment and putting America in the forefront of innovation and energy creativity.""

165,"Reporter Bill Lambrecht: E-mail: blambrecht@post-dispatch.com Phone: 202-298-6880\ Motorists forced to suffer the diesel fumes of trucks and buses may soon be getting a whiff of a more palatable odor: French fries.\ Midwestern farm interests are backing legislation to create millions of dollars of government subsidies to promote ""biodiesel,"" fuel blended with soybean oil which, when burned, can smell something like a salty snack.\ Borrowing from the playbook of producers of corn-based ethanol, the biodiesel industry is seeking tax incentives for fuel suppliers. If 100 million gallons of biodiesel were used under the open-ended subsidy plan being promoted by the Missouri-based industry, the cost to taxpayers would be $150 million.\ In addition, the soybean industry is teaming with corn-growers to seek government-ordered use of their fuels that could yield millions of dollars in profits.\ The proposals, which are pending in the Senate, will go a long way toward determining whether biodiesel advances beyond the status of a curiosity fuel.\ Farmers will be tuned in to the congressional action because success by the biodiesel industry would trigger an increase in soybean prices, which now are hovering at their lowest in a generation.\ The political climate looks favorable. President George W. Bush arrived in Washington with a pro-development attitude on energy and he's under pressure to help industries other than oil and gas.\ Higher prices at the pump have enabled the farm industry and their allies in Congress to argue more persuasively that biodiesel reduces dependence on foreign oil - and does so in a way that causes less harm to the environment.\ But biodiesel backers must overcome the clout of the oil companies and suspicion from the trucking industry and highway lobby. What's more, environmental advocates dislike almost anything to do with diesel fuel.\ Just as daunting is the aversion by budget hawks to spending more on farm programs and propping up industries that can't thrive without subsidies. Farm spending ballooned last year to over $30 billion, much of it spent to bolster the dismal prices farmers are receiving. Corporate interests also partake heavily of those benefits and are seeking even more next year.\ Free-market advocates such as Jerry Taylor of the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington disparage subsidies for biodiesel.\ ""It's just another way of throwing more money to the biggest welfare recipients in the country - the farm industry,"" he said. ""The dirty secret is that most of these subsidies don't go to the little guys that Willie Nelson sings about; they go to the agribusiness companies.""\ John B. Campbell, a former undersecretary in the Agriculture Department, is an executive at Ag Processing Inc. in Nebraska, one of the companies that stands to prosper from subsidies.\ ""It's going to be hard to argue why biodiesel shouldn't get a couple hundred million dollars in a $30 billion energy package,"" said Campbell, referring to the House-passed energy bill. Without subsidies, he said, biodiesel would be a ""niche market.""\ Missouri-born fuelKenlon Johannes was running the Missouri Soybean Council in 1990 when filling even a small market for biodiesel seemed fanciful.\ Johannes had read a report from the University of Missouri advising cultivation of canola for its oil to blend with diesel fuel. The Europeans had done it for a long time.\ He phoned university researchers. ""We've got soybean oil all over the place,"" Johannes said, triggering research that his industry helped pay for.\ It didn't take long to figure out what to mix with soy oil and diesel to create a successful fuel (methanol and a catalyst). In 1992, Johannes drove his biodiesel-powered Ford F-250 pickup from Jefferson City to Washington and through the gates of the White House, where he was granted an audience to show off what Missourians had achieved.\ Biodiesel retains its Missouri roots: The industry's trade association, the National Biodiesel Board, is situated in Jefferson City. The American Soybean Association has its headquarters in St. Louis.\ Soon, a new farmer-owned biodiesel plant might be built. Studies are under way to pick one of several sites in Missouri or Illinois for the $5 million to $10 million facility.\ Missouri has been the testing ground as well. The Bi-State Development Agency tested biodiesel in its buses in the mid-1990s and in June declared its intention to use over 1 million gallons next year - the product of 800,000 bushels of soybeans.\ Cincinnati has also decided to use biodiesel in some of its buses.\ Biodiesel devotees can fill up at stations in San Francisco and Las Vegas. A New Jersey school system switched to biodiesel and a Long Beach, Calif., hospital is fueling its generators and boilers with biodiesel.\ Small successes continue: The Agriculture Department announced Aug. 7 that it would power its vehicles with biodiesel as well as ethanol. The Pentagon, pushed by Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond R-Mo., also plans to use more of the soybean fuel.\ Subsidy suspicionThe test in Congress will be stiffer. For more than a decade, the ethanol industry has triggered regional clashes with its push for government assistance. Ethanol's subsidy, which has grown to more than $700 million annually, is scheduled to run through 2007.\ Biodiesel is going a similar route, seeking a partial exemption from the fuel excise tax paid by suppliers. Ethanol gets a 5.4-cent reduction from the 18.4-cent federal gas tax; biodiesel wants a 3- cent break. Fuel suppliers would be required to use both ethanol and biodiesel under still other legislation.\ Ethanol subsidies are controversial in part because they deplete the Highway Trust Fund, the pot of money dedicated to road building and repair.\ Biodiesel proponents hope to bypass that criticism with a provision that reimburses losses to the highway fund from the Agriculture Department's budget. The agriculture money would come from money not paid to farmers in price supports as a result of higher soybean prices, accordin g to biodiesel's backers.\ It may be tough to make that case, said Taylor Bowlden, vice president of the Highway Users Federation in Washington.\ ""If that argument is politically salable, which is questionable, it is an acknowledgment of the serious impacts that subsidies have had on the Highway Trust Fund,"" he said.\ The soybean interests also must find a better way to tell their a pro-environment story.\ Soybean oil cuts air pollution in several ways, according to an assessment by the Union of Concerned Scientists. Less petroleum in fuel means less pollution. The oxygen in soybeans enables burning of soot that otherwise would be released from the tailpipe. Lastly, biodiesel reduces carbon dioxide, a pollutant that contributes to global warming.\ There's one negative: Studies have showed a slightly higher release of nitrous oxide, one of the causes of smog.\ Despite the benefits, the biodiesel industry hasn't persuaded environmental groups, who routinely push cities to fuel their buses with natural gas and get rid of diesel altogether.\ ""We have some education to do,"" says Joe Jobe, executive director of the National Biodiesel Board.\ Park rangers at Yellowstone National Park decided to educate themselves before switching to biodiesel. They were worried the cooking-oil odor might attract bears. So the rangers conducted a ""Bear Attractant and Toxicity Test.""\ The bears stayed away. And rangers began filling up their tanks with biodiesel.\ ========\ Where soybeans grow\ State Acres planted"

Sorting Through Gas Tax Rhetoric
\
The price of gasoline has risen as much as 20 cents a gallon in the last few weeks. If you listen to the lame rhetoric coming from Congress, the blame is the 4.3-cent-a-gasoline tax that we have been paying for almost three years.
\
It was not this tax that caused the increase but the apparent greed of the gasoline companies. They have the supply, and they regulate the demand.
\
How dumb do politicians think the American public is? But this is an election year, and the word tax brings an immediate reaction. Why did it take three years for the tax to increase gasoline prices?
\
Oh, yes, Congress wants to eliminate the 4.3 cents a gallon only until the end of this year. The election will be over, and the tax word will simply disappear, and we will be paying it again. Does this mean that the oil companies can again raise it another 20 cents and Congress will blame it on the tax?
\
How much will this tax reduction save the average driver? About $2 a month, if you use almost 50 gallons of gas a month.
\
This is only political garbage. Remember this in November.

The Post-Dispatch must be the local outlet for the left-wing socialists of the Democrat Party. Its May 1 editorial reflects this.
\
The Post-Dispatch approved of raising working Americans' tax on their labors back in 1993 - plus a 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase to offset the deficit - not to be added to the highway fund.
\
Now that Sen. Bob Dole says to do away with the gas tax, the Post-Dispatch calls him shortsighted. Let's go through the poor neighborhoods of St. Louis and see the ratio of fuel-efficient vehicles to old gas guzzlers. These people cannot afford new autos.
\
Democrats say ""we feel your pain"" and then jab the suction tax needle a little deeper.
\
Only a socialist mind could call the extra tax a ""government-provided cushion"" and make up a story of disastrous consequence.

\
Sen. Bob Dole has found a way to make me consider voting for President Bill Clinton this fall. Dole pushed to have the gasoline tax rolled back 4.3 cents a gallon.
\
I could see where rolling the gasoline prices back by nine-tenths of a cent for each gallon would be clever and neat. This would eliminate those silly nine-tenths of a cent additions on the gasoline signs. But reducing the price by 4.3 cents a gallon makes no sense.
\
The big question is, what will keep the price down? The basic market pr ice of gasoline could jump back up in no time. Then the economics would be back where it was. The fantastic reduction by Dole of 4.3 cents a gallon could be gone in no time.

Undue Criticism

Amy Adams Squire Strongheart's May 3 Commentary article bashed Dr. James Dobson and the work of Focus on the Family. She referred to the headquarters in Colorado Springs as a compound, which it is not, and indicated that it is extremely hostile to gays.
\
I have supported Dobson's work for years; he believes in the intrinsic worth of every individual. Just because he does not believe in the gay and lesbian movement does not mean that he wishes ill for those involved in it.
\
Dobson's organization contributed no money to the 1992 Colorado initiative to which Strongheart referred. She has confused Dobson's work with that of another group.

\
Or worse yet, who are we to decide that this baby's life has no value? How many families are willing to adopt special-care babies?

Those families on an adoption waiting list can tell you the great value that life holds. Our job is not to determine whose life has more value. Our job is to provide caring, life-affirming, practical options for women in a crisis pregnancy.

167,"I read Councilman Dan Chiles' recent fairy tales regarding mass transit, riding bikes and clean-energy innovation and was stunned by their shortsightedness. If Dan and his liberal buddies would hold hands, sing ""Kumbaya"" and tap their ruby slippers together, the Wizard might grant them foresight.\How can you write an article about clean-energy solutions and never mention the cleanest form of energy there is: nuclear power. Nuclear power emits zero greenhouse gases. The technology is here now; we don't have to invent it. Energy generated right now by solar and wind is 1/10th of 1 percent of the energy we use. Yes, nuclear power has drawbacks, as do wind and solar. It would take 20,000 acres of land filled with solar panels to match one nuclear plant. It should be easy to find 20,000 acres around Springfield. Unbelievable.\As for the mass transit-bicycle thingy: For years the liberal state of Oregon promoted lower emission standards on cars and trucks sold there, because global warming is killing the planet. (Ha!) They even offered tax incentives to get people to buy fuel-efficient cars like hybrids. Anyone care to guess what happened?\For starters, all those fuel efficient cars mean the state's collecting 5 million dollars per year less in gas tax revenue. That's the revenue used to build roads, bridges, and really neat stuff like that. Realizing that they'd soon not have enough money to pave a driveway, they came up with a plan only a liberal could love: Put GPS transponders in every new car sold and start taxing the miles a person drives.\Just think of the advantages of having a GPS in every car. Big Brother liberal will know where you're at 24-7. And Big Brother liberal can track exactly when the driving was done, meaning government can charge you more at certain times, like morning and evening rush hours. Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't liberals squealing like pigs when President Bush wiretapped suspected terrorists, enemies of America? Now liberals in Oregon want a GPS in every citizen's car!\All of which creates two questions I need answered. 1) Why buy a hybrid? If a hybrid is taxed at the same rate (miles driven) as a Hemi, I'll take the Hemi. 2) Mr. Chiles, have you ever served in government in Oregon?\People, the bottom line is: Big Brother liberal is coming after your freedoms. A tobacco tax because Big Brother government says you don't need to smoke. Cap and trade because Mr. Chiles says you're killing the environment. A GPS in every car, because you don't care if the government knows where you are every minute. And if the liberals have their way, you better put down that doughnut if you want your government health care. It's about control. The government now controls the banks, 56 percent of mortgages through Fannie and Freddie, two car companies, and unless we act, all energy sources and all health care.\I have just one request; don't start the revolution without me!\Mike Hall lives in Springfield. He is a regular contributor to the News-Leader."

WASHINGTON (AP) - A U.S. motorist pulls into a service station and plunks down $1.05 for a gallon of gasoline. In Britain the same amount of gas would cost the equivalent of $2.77.
\
Why the difference? British motorists, and drivers in many other European countries, pay taxes accounting for approximately half of the price of gasoline at the pump, making it a luxury item for many.
\
Some now believe the modest U.S. federal gas tax of 9 cents a gallon could be headed in the same direction.
\
""We are about to follow the Europeans down the road of no return,"" says Bill Berman, director of energy and environment for the American Automobile Association.
\
He also heads a newly formed umbrella group called Fuel Users for Equitable Levies (FUEL), which recently began a grass-roots campaign to offset mounting pressure for a gas tax increase as a way of reducing the nation's $155 billion budget deficit. The anti-tax lobby is supported by such groups as the American Farm Bureau Federation and the American Petroleum Institute.
\
No gas tax increase is imminent, but with policy-makers desperate for some solution to the deficit, the debate is in full swing.
\
Critics say a tax increase would mean slower business, higher inflation and fewer jobs.
\
Supporters retort that a higher tax would calm international deficit jitters and thus strengthen the economy in the long run. As an added benefit, they claim, it would reduce America's growing dependence on foreign oil by curbing demand for gasoline.
\
""The effort must now be made to get the deficit down,"" former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said in calling for an increase in the tax.
\
President-elect George Bush is opposed to a higher gas tax, but the idea has drawn support from witnesses before the 14-member National Economic Commission created by Congress to search for deficit remedies.
\
Each penny-a-gallon of additional tax would yield $1 billion in revenue. That makes it seem an attractively quick way to sharply reduce the budget deficit.
\
Business is divided. Within the auto industry, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca supports a tax increase, but General Motors Corp. is stoutly opposed to it on the ground that it would hammer the economy. Ford Motor Co. is hesitant on the issue but has said it could support a phased increase of 5 cents a gallon per year.
\
The road-building lobby, led by the Associated General Contractors, opposes a tax increase on the ground that the additional revenue would go to cutting the budget deficit instead of expanding the $14 billion Federal Highway Trust Fund. There is no assurance that the additional tax collections would be used for trimming the deficit, however, if the money were channeled into general revenues.
\
In Congress, Southwesterners are cool to anything that would reduce demand for gasoline at a time when energy-producing economies back home are feeling the pain of depressed oil prices.
\
""I hope they are able to avoid any new tax, including a gasoline tax,"" Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said in a statement.
\
As chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, Bentsen would have much to say about the matter.
\
Across Capitol Hill, at the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, the picture is different. Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., has been smiling on the idea of a gas tax increase, although his last attempt to push one through failed on the House floor.
\
""It was good economic policy and good energy policy,"" Rostenkowski told a Wall Street group recently. ""It was not good politics.""

How does it happen that a man unknown to most Americans, one of 100 senators and a freshman at that, can dictate energy policy and much of fiscal policy to the entire nation?
\
The short answer is that President Bill Clinton, desperate for votes for his budget, can't afford to lose any more of the 49 Democrats who supported it in the earlier round of voting, when Vice President Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote to keep it alive. So when Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, one of the 49, announced he would accept no gas tax hike higher than 4.3 cents a gallon, it didn't matter what anyone else thought.
\
Thus, an ambitious plan to reduce dependence on foreign oil, improve the efficiency of energy use and help clean up the environment went down the drain - and a $49 billion hole was ripped in Clinton's budget, forcing higher taxes on a few and deeper program cuts for many.
\
Kohl wasn't alone in using the situation to impose his political agenda on the nation. Other senators also set a policy price for their votes. Kohl's press secretary says the senator just wanted to ""draw the line"" on middle-class taxes, and his stand is popular with voters in Wisconsin, where he faces re-election next year.
\
With very little notice, the Senate has become increasingly unrepresentative of the United States. As population has concentrated in 100 or so major metropolitan areas and a dozen mega-states, the disparity between the House and Senate has grown. In this Congress, a majority of senators - actually 54 of 100 - come from states that collectively elect only 87 representatives, one-fifth of the members of the House. That is the major reason measures like the energy tax can command majorities in the House but be killed in the Senate.
\
Just as important is the political independence of today's senators. Originally, senators were elected by state legislatures, which meant their tenure depended on staying on good terms with their counterparts back home. When the popular election of senators began 80 years ago, political parties were strong enough to exert real influence on the selection of Senate nominees.
\
But nowadays, senators mount their own campaigns and essentially operate as individual political entrepreneurs, not to say prima donnas. One indication of this trend can be found in the fact that one-fifth of today's senators held no elective office of any kind before coming to the Senate.
\
Like Herb Kohl, they simply saw the Senate as a place where they could make a mark. Kohl financed his election in 1988 with $7.5 million of his own money, wiping out his primary- and general-election opponents with the most expensive campaign Wisconsin had ever seen.
\
This is not a plea for abolishing the Senate. But when a single senator, operating solely by his personal compass, can set policy for the whole country, the great design of the Constitution has gone awry.

If you were old enough to drive a car before the Arab oil embargo of 1973, you probably delight in telling the younger crowd about the good old days when gasoline was 30-some cents a gallon.
\
Here's an eye-opening fact, then - and a shut-up-the-geezer comeback for the youngsters: After adjustment for inflation, the 1972 average price of 36.1 cents a gallon comes out to $1.22 in today's dollars.
\
Yes, gasoline is cheaper today than it was in 1972. Unleaded regular sold for an average $1.10 a gallon across the nation last week, according to the American Automobile Association. The AAA Auto Club of Missouri pegged the St. Louis average price at 91.5 cents.
\
Dennis Eklof, senior consultant at Cambridge Energy Research Group in Boston, said gasoline is even cheaper when measured against Americans' personal income. By that measure, he said, gasoline is the cheapest it's been since World War II.
\
What's more, American gasoline is dirt cheap by international standards. Italian drivers pay more than $5 a gallon, Britons and Japanese pay close to $4 and Canadians and Australians pay about $2. Lower taxes account for much, but not all, of the U.S. price advantage.
\
But you can expect higher energy taxes to be a prime topic of discussion in Washington as Bill Clinton looks for ways to cut the federal budget deficit and Al Gore seeks ways to clean up the environment.
\
During the presidential campaign, Clinton was critical of Ross Perot's plan for a 50-cent-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax over five years. But more recently, his two top appointees to the Office of Management and Budget, Leon Panetta and Alice Rivlin, have spoken favorably about the idea of raising the gas tax.
\
Consumers have already endured a five-cent federal tax increase in 1991 and various state tax increases, including a two-cent rise in Missouri last year. But the tax on a gallon of gasoline, adjusted for inflation, is less today than it was in 1972.
\
The current federal gasoline tax is 14 cents a gallon, and states add an average tax of 20 cents on top of that. Missouri's state tax is 13 cents a gallon; Illinois levies a 19-cent gas tax plus a 5 percent sales tax.
\
Sensing the Clinton administration's interest in the issue, lobbyists are already lining up behind their favorite energy-tax ideas.
\
Carmakers say they could live with a higher gasoline tax, seeing that as preferable to stiffer fuel-efficiency rules.
\
Oil producers would rather have an oil-import fee, which would make their domestically produced oil relatively more valuable.
\
Environmentalists would support a higher gasoline tax, but would prefer a carbon tax that would hit all fossil fuels, including coal.
\
Clinton may yet decide that a significant rise in the gasoline tax would be political suicide because of the effect it would have on every driver's pocketbook.
\
""The American consumer has a really emotional reaction to gasoline taxes,"" Eklof said. ""We act as if it's our God-given right to drive wherever we want, whenever we want, as much as we want.""
\
But, precisely because gasoline is a consumer good, a higher gas tax would be less harmful to the economy than the alternatives.
\
The oil-import fee would not only provide a big windfall to domestic producers, but it would hurt all big energy users, from farm to factory to power plant.
\
""That is going to hurt the competitiveness of U.S. exports,"" Eklof said. Such export ""stars"" as agriculture and the petrochemical industry are very energy-intensive, he noted.
\
The same criticism applies in spades to the carbon tax, which would have the additional political liability of being hard on coal producers.
\
""If you believe carbon dioxide emissions pose a long-term climate threat, then that (the carbon tax) is the way to go,"" Eklof said. ""Right now there's very little public support for it.""
\
Eklof says that either the oil-import fee or the carbon tax would have geopolitical implications. That is, they wouldn't make Saudi Arabia very happy.
\
The Saudis registered a strong protest last year when the European Community proposed a carbon tax, Eklof said.
\
Despite the political difficulties involved in getting a gasoline-tax increase passed, Eklof believes that's the most likely energy-tax proposal to emerge from Congress.
\
""If we get one, it'll be something phased in over three to four years, at 10 to 15 cents a gallon,"" he predicted.
\
That would be just enough to boost the price of a gallon back to the pre-1973 level, after adjusting for inflation.

171,"
Cell phone levy also loses statewide; Buchanan County voters extend law enforcement tax, re-elect Scroggins and Conway; Higginbotham wins
\
Both statewide tax issues - a transportation tax and a cell-phone-user fee - failed badly across Missouri late Tuesday night. Almost uniformly, two-thirds of voters said ""no"" to paying more taxes.
\
The defeat of Proposition B, a tax-increase package to improve highways and other transportation resources, appeared certain in spite of a $3.5 million campaign promoting it. Buchanan County said ""no"" 12,299 times - with only 5,320 ""yes"" votes for the transportation plan.
\
""This is certainly very disappointing,"" said Rodney Gray, director of Time for Missouri, the coalition that raised the advertising funds. ""The Legislature put together what they thought was the best plan, but the voters obviously disagree. We knew in this current economic environment any kind of tax was going to be difficult.""
\
Proposition B would have raised the state sales tax a half cent, to 4.725 cents on a dollar. It also would have raised the gasoline tax by 4 cents, to a total of 21 cents a gallon. The funds would have gone to improve a transportation system that is generally acknowledged to need help: roads, bridges, airports and ports.
\
""The system isn't getting any better by itself,"" Mr. Gray said. ""I hope Missourians can find a way to remedy the situation.""
\
If passed, the transportation package would have been Missouri's largest-ever tax increase and would have marked the first time roads had been funded with something other than a user fee, such as a gas tax or license fee.
\
The failure of Proposition B will set the state's road system back by several decades, said transportation department director Henry Hungerbeeler.
\
""Mathematically, it will take us 35 years now to do what we could have done in 10 years if Proposition B had passed,"" Mr. Hungerbeeler said from Missouri Department of Transportation headquarters in Jefferson City. ""I'm certainly hoping it doesn't take 35 years to regain their trust in our capabilities.""
\
Locally, MoDOT is looking at new priorities.
\
""The things we wanted were safety and to take care of the roads,"" said Dave Ahlvers, district engineer in the St. Joseph office. ""Now we'll focus on that with our current funds. We'll be taking care of what we have and working on those areas where we have a lot of accidents. We don't want them to get in a worse state of disrepair than what we already have.""
\
Proposition A would have put a monthly fee of up to 50 cents on cellular-phone accounts to raise money for an enhanced 911 service. The enhancement would allow authorities to find a caller using a cell phone, which is not now possible. It also would have helped fund technology to route the call into a nearby 911 dispatch center.
\
Voters said ""no."" In Buchanan County, the vote was 12,095 ""no"" to 5,376 ""yes,"" 69 percent to 31 percent. According to the Missouri Chapter of the National Emergency Number Association, Missouri is one of only 10 states without statewide funding for the enhanced 911 technology.

172,"In an effort to give voters more information about this year's statehouse races, the News-Leader is surveying candidates running for office this fall on top-of-mind state and national issues and publishing the answers.\Republican Bill Owen and Democrat Allison Schoolcraft are the choices this fall for House District 131, which covers northern Springfield and north-central Greene County.\The incumbent, Republican Rep. Sonya Anderson of Springfield, is term-limited.\Here's how they answered the questions, with minor editing for length and style, in the order they'll appear on the ballot.\How old are you?\Owen: 67 years old.\Schoolcraft: 40 years old.\What do you do for work?\Owen: Recently retired from a nearly 40-year-career in banking in Springfield.\Schoolcraft: I have spent my adult career working for a variety of nonprofits in the health and human service sector. In the past few years, I have stayed at home with my children and I am currently working on my master's degree in nonprofit and civic leadership from Drury University.\Why are you the best candidate for your district?\Owen: My years of experience. From local banker, to community boards and having chaired the Governmental Relations committees of both the Springfield Chamber and the Missouri Bankers Association. I even served in the Missouri House in the 1980s, which will bring a different perspective to the chamber.\Schoolcraft: It may not be politically correct to say this, but in short, there are enough old white guys in Jefferson City. They don't represent the vast majority of the people of the district's interest and it is well past time for the good people of Missouri and especially the 131st District to have a voice in Jefferson City.\What is your opinion of the state's response to the coronavirus outbreak thus far?\Owen: I am one who believes government that governs closest to the people governs best. By allowing the local authorities latitude to determine what is best for each community meant Ozark County, which has only had a few cases, is not under the same guidelines as a Springfield or St. Louis. As far as how each governmental subdivision has handled their responsibilities would require a discussion of each one individually. Some have performed better than others.\Schoolcraft: The numbers don't lie. We continue to see COVID-19 cases rise and that is a result of poor leadership. We need political leaders that are bold enough to take a stand when it may not be the popular thing to do, when it may cost them votes, because it is the right thing to do. Whether politicians do that can sure tell you a lot about what you need to know regarding their character and if they have the gumption necessary to lead our great state.\What will you do as a legislator to help the state recover from the outbreak moving forward?\Owen: We have to look for ways we can return to business activity while at the same time adhering to measures to keep everyone safe. Legislatively, we need to continue to pass legislation that makes it easier for business to operate and grow. The retail sector has been particularly hit hard. We need some protection from litigation if the business is following best practices to prevent COVID-19 from impacting their employees and customers.\Schoolcraft: There are a lot of people hurting and there is no easy answer. To start, we need to be investing in our infrastructure that would help create jobs and the ripple effect of those jobs would infuse money into our communities. Along with that, we will verify that Medicaid expansion is rolled out so that those that qualify can receive it.\What will you do as a legislator to minimize the impact of any economic downturn on the state budget?\Owen: This is not a simple fix. We have not done a very good job of doing performance auditing of state departments to make sure we are operating in the most efficient manner possible. It is stunning how much the state budget has grown over the last 40 years. Doing audits will also assist the House Budget Committee when it begins the appropriations process each year to determine where dollars need to be allocated.\Schoolcraft: Our existing state budget, prior to COVID-19, was in trouble. The pandemic is only exacerbating the gaping shortfall. We may have to make some hard choices to trim our budget. For example, do our legislators really need valet parking at the Capitol? I would argue they should be able to park their own cars to save the taxpayers that expense.\Do you think calls for changes to the state's criminal justice system are justified? If so, why, and which changes do you support? If not, why not?\Owen: I would agree that there are changes needed in the state's justice system to not only see that violent criminals stay in jail and serve their terms but to also see that nonviolent offenders are not treated in the same fashion and are not spending long sentences and that they find help in rehabilitation so they can re-enter society and the workplace.\The recently passed Senate Bill 600 went a long way to addressing some of these issues. (Editor's note: SB 600 increased penalties on violent crimes, especially those committed with a weapon, and made it easier to prosecute people who plan crimes or who are gang members.)\Schoolcraft: Investing in mental health, health care, drug rehabilitation and education would do more for our criminal justice system in the long run than anything else. If you want to change our criminal justice system, let's start there. I oppose any talk of privatizing the criminal justice system.\What will you do as a legislator to improve educational outcomes for Missouri students?\Owen: The COVID-19 outbreak showed us how inadequate our abilities were to deliver internet educational services to rural students and districts. We have got to focus on a strategy to close that gap. Also make sure we have alternatives for students in underachieving districts so that every child has the opportunity to a quality education.\Schoolcraft: To start, I would stop stealing money from our schools and our children to give to prisons. Investing in our children's education will do a heck of a lot more for us than investing in incarcerating them later on. How our governor can cut $200 million worth of funding for education and in practically the same week sign a bill that will put more people in prisons is mindless.\(Editor's note: A nonpartisan fiscal analysis of that bill projects it will put more than 2,500 additional inmates in state prisons by 2038, when the costs for the additional inmates will reach $16 million per year.)\The single best determinant of a person's success is an education. The more money we strip from that funding, the more challenging it becomes to keep qualified educators working in those schools. We need to support our educators and school administrators.\Do you support the proposal to expand Medicaid on the August ballot? Why or why not? (Editor's note: Owen answered this question before voters approved expansion on Aug. 4.)\Owen: Since this will be determined by voters, I think the better question is: How are we going to pay for the state's portion of the cost? Some estimates say that will be over $100 million. From a legislator's standpoint we need to think about ways we can use new funds approved by voters to reduce the cost of state services in other areas. A good example is mental health. If we can reduce our jail and prison populations by using Medicaid funds to house inmates in a better and less expensive environment we can maybe redirect savings to the state's Medicaid obligation. With 60 percent of the Greene County jail population having mental health as an underlying issue we might be able to derive some real savings. Otherwise, we will have to determine where to make additional cuts. Remember, the governor has already withheld $450 million from the current budget.\Schoolcraft: Yes, I support the expansion of Medicaid. Too many community hospitals have had to shutter their doors because of our state's failure to expand Medicaid. It isn't just about helping those that live below the poverty threshold, it's about the communities that rely on these hospitals and the jobs that are being lost when hospitals are forced to close and the impact of those job losses on the community. At a time when more and more Missourians are finding themselves unemployed because of the effects of this pandemic, it is an even more relevant issue.\How will you address concerns about the state's aging infrastructure?\Owen: The most sensible method is a gas tax increase. Like a use tax, the amount you pay is determined by your usage. Also, out-of-state drivers who use our road system will pay their proportionate share of the cost (from gas they purchase here.)\Schoolcraft: It's well past time that those that utilize our resources help to support them. Toll roads work well in other states and utilizing toll bridges and roads would force those that use them to pay for them. It would do all that while creating local jobs and bringing revenue into our state while encouraging growth. As much as we all hate taxes, a gas tax is also an appropriate way to pay for upgrades: those that use more fuel are also the ones that utilize the infrastructure and should help pay for its upkeep. In 2018, the ballot initiative to increase the gas tax failed, but largely people refused to support the bill because it felt like a bait-and-switch: the revenue from the taxes was going to be utilized to largely support law enforcement rather than infrastructure.\(Editor's note: The proceeds from the gas tax increase proposed in Proposition D would have gone to replace the money the Department of Transportation currently sends the Missouri State Highway Patrol, freeing up existing revenue for roads and bridges.)\What issue not mentioned so far do you plan to make a priority if you win your election? Why that one?\Owen: It is a policy issue. For a number of years, the Missouri Housing Development Corp. has been focused on building apartments to provide housing for people of low-to-moderate income. By redirecting their focus to our older neighborhoods rebuilding the housing stock of the homes in our older neighborhoods we will not only provide adequate housing for those in need but for no additional money help to rebuild our older neighborhoods.\Schoolcraft: Respecting the votes of Missourians. Missourians have continually voted on ballot measures that the legislature then ignores. We saw it with right-to-work legislation as well as Clean Missouri. Enough is enough, I will listen to my constituents and respect their votes on ballot measures and will make sure that the right for people to bring ballot initiatives to a vote remains codified in our state.\What else should voters know about you?\Owen: That I truly love the Ozarks and the people in it and have, over the course of a lifetime, been involved in numerous community organizations as a way to give back to the community that has meant so much to me.\Schoolcraft: I would be honored to serve the amazing people of the 131st. I feel very fortunate to call this little corner of the Ozarks my home. I promise to listen to my constituents first, to be straight with you and to always vote in the interest of the people. The benefit of having a small campaign is that I am not beholden to anyone and I will vote my conscience.\Austin Huguelet is the News-Leader's politics reporter. Got something he should know?

173,"Costly plan to expand lock-and-dam system\It's hard to think of a more outrageous proposal than the recent attempt by the barge industry and corporate agriculture to dupe the public into subsidizing enlarging the Mississippi River lock-and-dam system.\The industries, under the guise of the lobbying group called MARO 2000, claim that the system needs to be enlarged to handle expected increases in barge traffic carrying increased grain harvests to compete with agricultural products from other countries. But the Army Corps of Engineers' own study refutes this. The Corps is hardly an agency to pass up an opportunity to build locks and dams if at all justifiable.\Enlarging the lock-and-dam system would cost the public huge sums. MARC 2000 claims that half of the $1.2 billion price tag would be paid for from barge-related gas tax funds. But the taxpayers would pay the rest and also pay the full cost for the ongoing maintenance of the lock-and-dam system. Barge traffic is the second-most- subsidized transport in the country, after space travel. This subsidy primarily helps corporate agriculture, not the family farmer.\In addition, enlarging the lock-and-dam system and accompanying barge traffic would cause environmental damage along the Mississippi. Maintaining the structures and the deep channels required for barge traffic diminishes the river's ability to create and sustain fish and wildlife habitat.\Congress should reject this misguided effort.\Caroline Pufalt\Chesterfield\Questions on Kosovo\I value Harry Levin's insights on things military but question his characterization of Russia's attitude on the Kosovo situation in a March 28 article. He wrote that Russia is ""sulking."" I think Russia is showing remarkable restraint.\In 1914, Russia mobilized its army in response to Austria's threats to Serbia. This precipitated World War I when Germany mobilized in response.\Think what our reaction would have been if the Warsaw Pact had survived and it expanded to Mexico. How would we have responded if the Warsaw Pact launched an attack on Canada?\James E. Elliott\Florissant\Some good suggestions were made for ways to use the surplus tax dollars such as saving Social Security, saving Medicare and paying down the national debt. Now comes President Bill Clinton and Congress with a better idea: Let's stick our nose in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia. Let's try to settle a dispute that has been going on for years and years. Never mind that these people don't want our help. Never mind that their neighbors don't care. In fact, it appears that most of Europe does not care. Once again, Uncle Sam to the rescue.\What do you suppose will happen to the surplus now that we are sending million-dollar missiles, $50 million fighter jets and $2 billion stealth bombers into combat. There goes the surplus and all hope of solving any of our own problems.\When will our leaders learn to mind their own territory and let others do the same? Did we learn nothing in Korea and Vietnam? Let's worry about out real enemy - China. If we stay on our current path, China will defeat us economically and militarily. Let's worry about the real threat.\R.L. Tenholder\Maryland Heights\Student newspaper\The reason 100 Parkway West students protested outside the high school last week is that we believe in what is taught to us in government class: Our rights do not end at the schoolhouse gate.\The administration may have the legal right to claim that the phrase ""crotch itch"" violates community standards, but I find this stance hard to believe. A handful of teachers and students - none of whom actually complained to the Pathfinder staff - is not enough to label the cover itself ""inappropriate"" and thus ban distribution of the newspaper.\Furthermore, as critical and independent thinkers, shouldn't we have the right to see the material and make our own judgments so long as the material is not illegal and does not disrupt the school environment?\If one disagrees, he or she should write a letter to the editor. Don't ban the material from general consumption.\Parkway West students no longer have a forum to openly discuss the issues that affect them. The Pathfinder will never be the same because of a shortsighted decision by the administration.\Shawn Kumar\Senior\Parkway West High School\Ballwin\I read the March 29 editorial, ""Students have rights too,"" with interest. As someone who has been involved professionally in the field of writing, I think your conclusion misses one very important point. Student newspapers are written and published most often by people who are just starting in journalism. It takes a strong, active adviser to teach these students the ""profession"" and how to read their constituents to determine the community standards they must meet.\The Pathfinder's cover perpetuates the negative stereotypes of women and men and has language that is objectionable by my standards as a woman and mother. It appears that the adviser's guidance was either not taken or ineffectual. In such a case, I think the principal has every right to step in.\Laura Reeb\Hazelwood\Even the Post-Dispatch has an editor. In very real terms, the principal is the editor of a school paper. Liability certainly rests at the principal's door.\Kudos to Principal Beth Plunkett for reminding students that the right to offend is not absolute.\Dave Lindley\St. Charles\Helmet choice\All Sen. Danny Staples is trying to do is give adults the right to choose how to live their own lives. If an adult chooses not to wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle, who is the state or the Post- Dispatch to be the ultimate arbiter of choice? While many will choose not to wear head protection, on the other hand, many will choose to use it.\While I support the right for people to choose, I will continue to wear my helmet if SB294 passes. As a Marine and as a firefighter/EMT, I have always had to wear a helmet for protection, and as a biker I will always continue to wear my helmet. That is my personal choice.\While there are studies that show that helmets save lives, there are also studies that show that they cause head and neck injuries (and co nsequentially death) too. I've had friends who were saved by a helmet. However, they would not have been injured at all had other motorists on the road given them the courtesy to pay attention to them and respect their right to be on the road also. Whether you wear a helmet or not is not a burden to the state.\I support Staples for trying to give me the right to choose how I live.\Jon F. Krueger\Glencoe\Teachers' residency\The March 6 editorial, ""Game plan for Jeff City,"" says, ""The roots of the problem partially lie within the city school, where chaotic classrooms ... low morale suffocate new teachers and drive them to the higher-paying suburbs.""\Superintendent Cleveland Hammonds, the School Board, the mayor and the Post-Dispatch have overlooked the simplest way to improve the St. Louis public school system. And it won't cost the taxpayers or the city a dime. The simple answer is residency for our public school teachers.\Living in the area in which they work gives people more pride, and because of this, they are apt to do a better job. This makes perfect sense for the city schools.\If teachers are required live in the community in which they teach, they will become more conscientious and therefore better educators. If teachers do a better job, the drop-out rate will decrease, test scores will soar and more students will graduate.\Hammonds, the School Board and the mayor all need to take a look at this no-cost solution.\John E. Ruzicka\St. Louis\Jefferson's words\In your March 27 editorial against a tax credit for parents sending their children to private schools, you quote Thomas Jefferson ""To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical.""\I wonder if you would also apply this principal if the subject was Planned Parenthood or government-funded abortions. I doubt it.\Rodney W. Stanfield\Effingham, Ill."

In order to increase revenue, the likelihood of increased taxes is probably a necessary evil. However, any tax requires the vote of the people.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ 1. Seek to bring more resources by way of jobs.\ 2. Seek the assistance of the current business district and retain them through tax incentives.\ 3. Research for untapped economic development funding streams.\ 4. Meet with neighborhood organizations that drive the community.\ 5. Work with my colleagues, the community and consistently survey the landscape of the 58th District.\ Isaiah Hair Jr.\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 57\ Home: St. Louis\ Occupation: Retired driver, Llohr Distributing Co.\ Political experience:\ Never elected to public office.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Stabilize the neighborhood through economic development.\ I would like to extend the empowerment zone and help organizations apply for loans and grants to be used in business opportunities. We don't even have a full-service supermarket. I want to bring a supermarket into the community.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 59\ Russ Carnahan\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: Yes\ Age: 44\ Home: St. Louis\ Occupation: Attorney, BJC Health Care\ Political experience: State representative, 59th District, 2000.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ I support the governor's initiatives to look for additional efficiency and economies in all levels of government and closing corporate tax loopholes. Also, to continue to work on an economic stimulus package for consideration in the upcoming session.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ I would continue the successful fight from last session to have the state historic preservation tax credits fully funded because of their impact to the neighborhoods in the 59th District. I would also push for continued funding of the childhood lead yesting program that I successfully passed. The program detects childhood lead poisoning levels. The levels are the highest in my area.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ We must address the accountability and performance of MoDOT before any further funding package can be presented to the voters. This should be the goal for this upcoming session and once achieved, we should proceed to place a bipartisan transportation package before the voters once again. The need for infrastructure improvements remains to be dealt with.\ Kevin Babcock\ No response received.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 60\ Amber Holly Boykins\ Incumbent, is unopposed.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 61\ Connie LaJoyce Johnson\ Incumbent, is unopposed.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 63\ Robin Wright Jones\ Democrat, no response received\ Sandra Chance\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 38\ Home: St. Louis\ Occupation: Homemaker\ Political experience: 8th Ward Republican comitteewoman.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ I know that all the items in the current budget benefit someone. However, at this time we will have to determine the amount of people that benefit from each item and whether there is a cheaper way of doing it with a comparable result. I would support an increase in the taxes on alcohol and tobacco as a way to generate additional income.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ I support vouchers and tax incentives for school choice. I will work to strengthen and expand the current charter school legislation. I support the passage of the Home Rule Amendment for St. Louis.\ I think that St. Louis would benefit from more small and mid- size businesses. I will work to attract and retain these businesses as well as larger businesses. I will work to retain and expand Missouri's development tax credit programs to support the redevelopment of downtown and neighborhoods in St. Louis to accommodate both residential and business needs while maintaining the historical and architectural integrity of those areas.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ I would support additional means of generating the money needed to support the current projected needs that have been identified. I would support raising the amount that is paid for registration of a car or truck or in obtaining a driver's license.\ I also would support creating toll roads in Missouri. I would support bond issues to support the needs of our highways. The infrastructure of Missouri is very important to keep and attract businesses. Our highways are a very important part of that infrastructure.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVEDISTRICT 64\ Bob Hilgemann\ Incumbent, is unopposed.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 65\ Fred Kratky\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 60\ Home: St. Louis\ Occupation: Real estate agent, Realty Net-Fred Kratky\ Political experience: Democratic Committeeman, 16th Ward, City of St. Louis.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ The legislators need to carefully evaluate proposals submitted by the governor and others. I am open to remedies of all kinds.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Improve public safety by advocating legislation that gives the city broader powers to deal with slum landlords and nuisance properties.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Again, we need to carefully evaluate any and all proposals that are submitted.\ Web site:\ www.fredkratky.com\ Judy A. Zakibe\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 48\ Home: St. Louis\ Political experience:\ Appointed to St. Louis Election Board.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ The financial situation the state is in has arisen partially because of overspending. I will look at all areas where we could cut spending. I would look at the Hancock Amendment to see if some adjustment can be made so we are not sending out $2 refunds. I will try to encourage economic development.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ I don't think we need a lot of new legislation. I would look at those laws already on the books to strengthen those that need it and possibly eliminate those that are not effective. My priorities are quality education and election reform.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The Department of Transportation should be looked at to see where we could cut costs. We should do repairs to roads and bridges before starting new projects. When the money is well spent, taxpayers will be more likely to give more.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 66\ Michael Vogt\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 38\ Home: Affton\ Occupation: Attorney, Vogt and Howard\ Political experience: Committeeman, Gravois Township.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ We need to raise more money. I think the best way to do this is to support industries that pay high wages and good benefits. A highly paid and skilled work force helps put money into our government and our commercial enterprises and helps to boost the lower working classes as well.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The Legislature needs to start anew on highway funding. We need to get with MoDOT and get the answers we need from them to verify their acco untability. Then we can proceed with a much-needed tax increase for our roads.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ * Neighborhood return of city schools.\ * Remove hold harmless burden from Affton schools.\ * Collective bargaining rights for public sector employees.\ * TIFs for inner suburbs and urban areas.\ * Fairer real estate assessments.\ Charles ""Chuck"" McCloskey\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 34\ Home: Marlborough\ Occupation: Self-employed patent attorney\ Political experience: Never elected to public office.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ Freeze spending across the board. Limit capital expenditures not absolutely necessary.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Cap assessed value increases at the lesser of the consumer price index or 5 percent annually.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ * Reduce MoDOT administrative expenses.\ * Limit use of outside consultants.\ * Reconsider priorities.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 67\ Mike Daus\ Incumbent, is unopposed.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 69\ Gina Walsh\ No Response Received.\ Arnie C. Dienoff\ Party: Independent\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 33\ Home: Bellefontaine Neighbors\ Occupation: Property Manager/Business consultant\ Political experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ I want to put together a coalition of other representatives to reshape state government and provide state resources and programs to all of the residents. we need to restructure. we need to cut the fat and pork-barrel spending habits. We need accountability nd responsibility by all departments. I have talked to several state employees in several departments and they know first-hand of waste on a daily basis. This waste needs to be rectified and dealt with.\ I want to make sure that our district reaps our fair share of tax dollars for improvements and make the quality of life better. All residents of the district need to be treated with the utmost of respect. I will lobby and be the champion of your issues and will work hard to find answers and resolutions to your problems.\ I will take steps to foster a stable economic work environment. We need to give the Department of Economic Development more tools and funding to lure companies and jobs to Missouri. We need to offer tax incentives that make sense to the state and to the community taxing districts. This will foster growth and stimulate income revenue.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district? Accountability and responsibility, respect and dignity. I will be an advocate for you and your family before any state agency, provide the best of customer and public service, no new taxes, a fair share of tax dollars to the district and North County, curb government waste, economy, public safety and security, education, school safety zones, medical coverage and prescription caps, women's health issues, overhaul of the Department of Transportation, no mandates without a solid funding source.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues? The state and all of its residents must mandate accountability and responsibility of the Department of Transportation and the Missouri Highway Commission. There is waste and expenses that are not needed and improper use of taxpayer money.\ We need to stop purchasing expensive equipment and get back to the business of repairing roads and providing a safe transportation network thoughout the state. We need a strong capital improvements program that will work. I will call for hearings in the House for these problems, as they need to be dealt with and rectified now.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 70\ Matt Muckler Is unopposed.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 71\ Esther Haywood Incumbent, no response received.\ Thomas L. Knapp\ Party: Libertarian\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 35\ Home: St. Louis County\ Occupation: Writer and editor, self-employed\ Political experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ I would oppose any budget that reflected a net increase (after inflation) in per capita spending by the state from year to year. The state's financial situation is a spending problem, not a revenue problem.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Defeating the continuous push for corporate welfare for sports franchises.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The state should concentrate on its transportation backbone and devolve ownership and responsibility for many smaller state roads to the counties and cities they serve. Privatization and toll roads should also be closely studied.\ Web site:\ www.knapp2002.org\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 72\ Betty L. Thompson\ Incumbent, is unopposed.\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 48\ Home: Richmond Heights\ Occupation: Self-employed lawyer\ Political experience: Ferguson-Florissant School Board, 1986- 1992.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ In the face of the lowest budget balances in recent state history, it is time to modify the Hancock Amendment to give more flexibility in establishing reserves. This will allow the state to address budget issues in a more systematic and comprehensive way and to prevent future budget crises during times of economic downturn. We must also creatively reexamine our budgetary priorities to attempt to find more effective ways to serve public needs.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ As a former school board member, supporting public education will be a top priority, particularly working to develop programs which will attract and retain excellent teachers. I will also focus on assuring that health care is accessible and guided by patients' needs; that the public is protected from high prescription drug costs; that the state fulfills its role in safeguarding the soundness of pension and retirement plans; and that guns laws are strengthened, particularly provisions to keep guns away from children.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The legislature must design a transportation plan that does not place as much burden on the sales tax as a revenue source as Proposition B. A comprehensive package of fee and license increases that primarily draws revenues from the users of our roads, with provisions for accountability of use of the money by the Department of Transportation, is the best short-term approach. Any plan must provide funding for a comprehensive mass transit system.\ Michael J. Howard\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 30\ Home: Maplewood\ Occupation: Sales, account executive, National Processing Co.\ Political experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ The state must run on a balanced budget! Education, seniors, and transportation are the initial priorities. Raising taxes for additional revenue is not the answer. Cutting unnecessary expenditures is part of the solution. Gambling revenue should be used for education.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Focus on education - getting and keeping quality, certified educators in the classroom. Quality teachers will improve the quality of education for our children. To accomplish this, we must increase the pay of Missouri's teachers. Gambling revenue is a prime source for this improved pay.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The voters have spoken. They were not impressed with the option put in front of them in the election. Obviously, repairs to current roads should prevail over any new construction projects. It will be the responsibility of the next session to prepare a bill that is acceptable to the voters of the state.\ Incumbent, is unopposed.\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 49\ Home: Florissant\ Occupation: Inspector, Boeing\ Political experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ With so many new legislators being sworn into office because of term limits, this may be an opportunity to re-examine our priorities as a state. The Legislature, House and Senate, Democrat and Republican, urban and rural, should work together to establish fiscal priorities and rank them according to importance. Our budget should be driven by those priorities. At the same time, we should determine whether our current spending matches up with those priorities and if not, cuts should be made in those areas.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Once elected, I will work to improve the quality of life for our aging population and strive to bring good jobs to Missouri. We must expand the state's prescription drug program, protect our vulnerable citizens and help keep seniors independent as long as possible. I will advocate that our state economic development dollars be spent on attracting businesses and keeping businesses that provide well- paying jobs with health care benefits.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The Department of Transportation must make better use of their budgeted dollars. We need a plan that will work for the entire state, urban and rural. Updating and maintaining existing highways should be the priority followed by improvements needed for highway safety. MoDOT will have to improve its job performance, hence improve public opinion, so that taxpayers will be willing to give them more money in the future.\ Paul Espinoza\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 39\ Home: Florissant\ Occupation: Investment broker/real estate investor, Forsyth Securities Inc.\ Political experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ The same thing I do in my financial consulting career for individuals every day:\ * Create a sound financial plan with short-term and long-term goals.\ * Cut unnecessary spending and use the savings to fund other departments by priority need. Last year there was more than $1.4 billion of allocated and unspent dollars, indicating that more careful attention should be given to budget planning.\ * Finally, the state needs an emergency reserve savings for ecomonic downturns rather than tapping into the rainy day fund, which is supposed to be used for natural disaster relief.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Two key pieces of legislation I strongly support are additional as sistance to our state's prescription drug program and a freeze on real estate taxes for senior citizens. This means seniors who may be on a fixed income would not be forced to leave their homes because of taxes and prescription drug costs. I support a cap on the amount that all others can have their taxes adjusted in a particular year, protecting them from unsubstantiated assessments. I would support The Classroom Trust Fund Act, which directs that gaming monies for education go into a separate fund and are distributed to the schools on a per-pupil basis beyond normal state funding. This would allow for teacher pay raises, better equipment and updated facilities.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ We all want smooth roads with no traffic congestion. At present, in the St. Louis/St. Charles area alone, there is construction everywhere, i.e., the 170 and 270 interchange, Interstate 70 to downtown and many more.\ The state needs a more systematic approach to construction projects, allowing citizens a free-flowing alternative. Finish one project before starting another in the same area. Finally, they will need to find alternative ways to raise money, invest current funds for future projects and adjust the timeline for completion of future planned projects. By no means should the failure of Prop B mean projects cannot be completed.\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 54\ Home: Florissant\ Occupation: Pipefitter, Jarrell Company\ Political experience: Florissant Planning & Zoning Commission, 1995-2002; Governor's Advisory Council on Aging since 1997.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ A return to common sense is essential to solving the state's financial situation. I am opposed to tax increases to cover budget shortfalls. A real effort must be made not only to increase our revenue with a renewed economy and proper development, but also to streamline government and do away with waste and bureaucracy. I am certain that many agencies can be reassessed and reconfigured to better meet the needs of our citizens. I particularly do not want to see programs for seniors suffer. Besides getting serious about streamlining all government operations, our success will be found through creating jobs and generating a strong economy through growth.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Helping seniors to live in their own homes and maintain their independence and quality of life for as long as is possible is a major goal for me.\ I also believe that the economic development of North County is essential to our community's quality of life. Also significant is getting our fair share of funding in our schools for our children's quality of life. Paramount to the success of any legislation will be making the tough decisions necessary to streamline government and offer services to our citizens while maintaining a balanced budget.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The voters voiced their frustration with the failings of state government when they defeated Proposition B. In order to deal with our highways, both the House and Senate transportation committees in cooperation with the governor's office need to assess the performance of the Highway Commission, and the General Assembly must take immediate action. The Department of Transportation must be streamlined and subject to serious and consistent overview.\ Those responsible for failing to meet goals and wasting our resources should face the music. Those who have worked relentlessly to fix the situation should be put in positions to make the necessary changes. We must soundly address decades of mismanagement so that these mistakes will never again occur.\ A plan must be proposed that will use common sense and real attention to cost and efficiency in order to initiate the necessary maintenance and construction of our highways. The bottom line is that we need to clean house and get busy setting up a new and better system. The time for ""Wait and see if it gets better"" is over. Change must occur now.\ Kent Miller\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 44\ Home: Florissant\ Occupation: Photographer/business owner, self-employed\ Political experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ With so many freshmen legislators coming in, it is a great time - with so many programs run by the state that have been entrenched without changes or updating - to start from scratch, top to bottom and take a look at every penny that is spent, every job that is on the state payroll, and eliminate any programs that are not working or are not cost-effective.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ To require that MoDOT spread the work that is being done around the state equally among those cities that generate money for the state. West County gets all of the goodies, and North County is only dealt with when MoDOT did not do their job right the first time. Ferguson, Florissant, Hazelwood, Calverton Park and Bridgeton generate over $17.5 million a year in sales taxes while Chesterfield, Wildwood, Manchester, Ballwin and Ellisville generate less than $15 million a year. North County is underrepresented when it comes to our tax dollars coming back.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Have MoDOT get its house in order before they ask the people of the state for more money.\ Web site:\ www.votekentmiller.com\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 39\ Home: St. Ann\ Occupation: Surveying crew chief, James Engineering & Survey\ Political experience:\ St. Ann alderman, 1993 through 1996; Airport Township Democratic committeeman since 1996.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ Accountability by all departments - adopt a corporate attitude, get more done with less funding. More budget cuts should be the first alter native, with tax increases the last.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Economic development for the area south of Lambert Field, assist the city of St. Ann with proposal for redevelopment of hotels and office park. We must get relief for our seniors for prescription drugs.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ We must start by getting public confidence in MoDOT. First, there will have to be restructuring of management and review of current and future projects. Then we can return to the voters for a smaller fuel tax increase.\ Pamela Barry\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 37\ Home: Edmundson\ Occupation: Principal of a special events company, Association Plus\ Political experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ I would create a financial plan with both short- and long-term goals, and cut unnecessary spending and use the savings to fund other departments. Last year there was more than $1.4 billion budgeted dollars unspent. Finally, the state needs to budget so that it doesn't have to touch the Rainy Day Fund.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ I would like to see our state give additional assistance for the prescription drug program and freeze real estate taxes for senior citizens. I also support a cap on the amount all others can have their taxes raised. Also, I would like to see the money from the casinos go into a separate fund and be given to the schools in addition to their normal state funding.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The state needs a more systematic approach to construction projects - finish one project before starting another. Also, we will need to find alternative ways to save money with the failure of Prop. B. This should not stop current projects from being completed.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 78\ Clint Zweifel\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 28\ Home: Florissant\ Occupation: Research and education director, Teamsters Local 688\ Political experience: Appointed member of Hazelwood Planning and Zoning Commission since April 2001.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ Each state department has room for increased fiscal responsibility and efficiency. I believe we can do more with the money we have. But instead of simply using popular catch phrases, let's get to work inside these departments and develop ways to make them run like an efficient, high-performing business. I am excited about bringing my values to the budgetary process. Most officials simply want to increase or cut spending, while I want to see the Legislature take a focused look on how we can improve performance, regardless of funding. We should perform an audit on all major state departments that focuses on day-to-day operational inefficiencies and implement changes to improve quality, responsiveness and efficiency.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ I will fight for great schools, quality health care, good jobs and fiscal accountability.\ * Education: I support legislation that will keep violence out of our schools, put discipline back in the classroom, demand accountability from the school districts, reduce class sizes and increase teacher salaries.\ * Health care: I will fight to expand the prescription drug program so that more seniors are eligible and more of the drugs they need are included. I want to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program so more children get the health care they deserve. Nursing homes must be held accountable in cases of abuse and neglect and we must do a better job of preventing abuse through background checks and training. We should re-enact the moratorium on certificate of need, which will help keep hospitals located in North County.\ * Retirement Security: In my full-time job, I help families with retirement planning, and I believe it is critical for Missouri to take the lead in toughening penalties for corporate criminals. Even though much of the recent accounting debacles are federal issues, we should send the federal government a message that we expect corporate accountability.\ * Economic Development: With so many fragmented municipalities, it is important we have a state representative who can play a leadership role for all of North County. I would like to form a coalition of state and local elected officials and residents who will work together on economic issues so that we gain a stronger voice in Jefferson City.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Missouri's transportation system is important to economic development in our state. Taxpayer accountability is the only way we can begin to build trust in state government. We can improve Missouri roads and public transit in the following ways:\ 1. End diversion of the 6-cent fuel tax enacted in 1992 and use it to fund what the state told taxpayers it would be used for in the first place: transportation.\ 2. Eliminate perks and waste.\ 3. Perform an audit on the Department of Transportation that focuses on day-to-day operational inefficiencies and implement changes that improve quality, responsiveness and efficiency. A recent audit of the department shows its change control process cost taxpayers nearly $2 million. The Post-Dispatch reported the department funds studies for projects that are not even economically feasible. We must have a MoDOT, and a state government, that has an incentive to increase responsiveness, quality and efficiency.\ 4. Invest in our infrastructure. We cannot wait for a crisis to begin worrying about roads. Like any homeowner, the state must constantly invest in its infrastructure to keep it up to date.\ Michael J. Reid\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: Yes\ Age: 48\ Home: Hazelwood\ Occupation: Legislator\ Political experience: Elected state representative in 1990, 1998 and 2000; elected state senator in 1992\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ We need to create an economic climate in Missouri that will attract new businesses and create new jobs. That's the number one issue. And we need to keep the jobs that are already here. More jobs and a strong economy will generate the revenues the state needs for education, building highways, and providing for the needs of our senior citizens. Companies such as Ford, Boeing and Lear generate a lot of revenue for the state by providing jobs that pay high wages with good benefits. We need to make sure those jobs stay here. The people of Missouri work hard to earn the money the state collects from them in taxes. Let's make sure that they are getting their money's worth and that not a single dollar is wasted. I am going to ask the House Budget Committee to conduct a review of the entire state budget to identify cost savings.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ 1. Education strengthens our democracy, improves the skills of our work force and helps our children realize their dreams. This year I voted for a $135 million increase in state funding for elementary and secondary education. I will continue to support more funding for schools, including funds for early childhood programs.\ 2. Many judges and some parole boards and have been too lax in giving probation or parole to violent criminals and to sex offenders. I will introduce legislation to deny probation to violent criminals and sex offenders. And I will sponsor a bill to expand the Truth in Sentencing law to make people who commit sex crimes against children serve at least 85 percent of their prison sentences.\ 3. Last September, I was a co-sponsor of Missouri's new SenioRx Prescription Drug Plan for senior citizens. Next year I will work to expand the plan so that more can participate.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The taxpayers of Missouri have sent a message that we need more accountability in state government. In particular they want to see better management of money by the Department of Transportation. The Legislature should review the way MoDOT is spending money and hold it accountable. MoDOT in turn needs to hold contractors accountable and make them liable for design mistakes that tie up traffic and waste the taxpayers' money. The trucking industry should pay its fair share of the costs of building and maintaining our highways and roads.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 79\ Albert ""Al"" J. Liese\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 62\ Home: Maryland Heights\ Occupation: Retired operating engineer, Ameren UE\ Political experience: Committeeman for the Maryland Heights Democratic Township Club since 1992.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ I believe we should make use of the Rainy Day Fund to help the state budget until revenues can be stabilized. We must also increase the efficiency of our limited tax dollars and eliminate duplicative and unnecessary services. We should also fight to maintain our triple A bond rating so we pay less for the money our state borrows.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ * Economic security -- I will fight for pro-growth economic legislation to attract and retain good-paying jobs for our state and region. Specifically, we should work to grow our economy through incentives for corporations that relocate to our state and promote education so that employers have a quality, educated workforce.\ * Education -- I believe state government should help provide a quality public education and promote a safe and secure learning environment for our children. I will fight for smaller class sizes and promote community partnerships to provide training, internships, and scholarships.\ Health care -- I will fight to keep Missouri's Prescription Drug Program for seniors, advocate more coverage for wellness care, and keep Missouri's Patient Bill of Rights (only two states in the nation have this, Missouri and Texas).\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ MoDOT must be held accountable. We should maintain our existing roadways but not undertake new projects until state revenues stabilize and grow. Highway commissioners should drive in automobiles rather than take state airplanes to their commission meetings.\ Web site: www.alliese.com\ Kathryn S. Fitzgerald\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 43\ Occupation: Social worker\ Political experience: Pattonville School Board, 1990-91 and 1992. President of the board for two years.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ I will work to control government spending. We need to pursue tax policies to get the economy growing again.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ I will push for school accountability for student achievement. We need to keep the promise made to voters that gambling revenues would go to schools. I will stop unfair property assessment, demand accountability in legislation. We need to cut taxes and government waste. I will seek to protect senior citizen programs, hold down the cost of prescription drugs and freeze property taxes.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ There is a need for better usage of the money that the Department of Transportation receives. MoDOT receives money that is designated to go for roads, and it should be spent on roads and highways.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 80\ Theodore ""Ted"" Hoskins\ Is unopposed\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 81\ Juanita Head Walton\ Incumbent, is unopposed\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 82\ Sam Page\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 37\ Home: Creve Coeur\ Occupation: Medical doctor, Western Anesthesiology Associates\ Political experience: Former two-term City Council member in Creve Coeur\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ First and foremost, we owe it to taxpayers to be as fiscally responsible as we can. But that responsibility must be accompanied by a commitment to set real priorities. For example, I'm a diehard Cardinal's fan, and we should do all we can to keep them in St. Louis. But using state dollars to fund new ventures for a private business should not eclipse the need we have to improve education, provide prescription drug relief to seniors or improve roads and bridges.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The Department of Transportation must restore confidence in the minds of Missourians. This requires a complete re-evaluation of the current structure and organization. We must have accountability in our state government.\ When Missourians believe they have a state government that is making sound policy decisions, only then can we consider a new transportation package to present to the voters. There are two transportation projects that must be completed for the residents of the 82nd District and the entire region. These are the Olive/270 overpass and the Page Avenue extension. I will fight to maintain the current construction schedule for these two important projects. What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ There are a variety of issues that concern people of the 82nd District - from putting an end to the state's budget fiasco and doing what we can to ensure that it never happens again, to maintaining quality schools and helping seniors through cutting costs of prescription medicine. As a father of two young boys, I'm deeply concerned about resolving the state budget crisis to avoid any cuts in education funding.\ As a doctor who was appointed by the governor as Missouri's Senior Prescription Drug Commissioner, I'm also very concerned about developing a program that provides meaningful relief from the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. These are the kinds of issues - education, health care, ensuring a fiscally sound state - that will make a real difference in people's lives. We need someone in state government who thinks like us and works to achieve these goals.\ Web site: www.SamPage2002.com\ Diann Bomkamp\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 54\ Home: Creve Coeur\ Occupation: Registered dental hygienist, Creve Coeur Periodontics, Inc.\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ * Cutting taxes for seniors on fixed incomes.\ * Creating a Classroom Trust Fund that would channel gaming money to each school district on a per-pupil basis.\ * Medical malpractice/tort reform legislation that could hold down health care costs\ * Possible tax credits for out-of-pocket medical/dental expenditures\ * Legislation (Anti-SLAPP) that allows citizens to speak out before governmental bodies without fear of lawsuits\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ Evaluate all the agencies and programs on how they spend our money. Utilize performance-based budgeting. Cut the overspending. The growth of goverment needs to stop without hindering essential services.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Make sure we address the accountability issue of the Department of Transportation with appropriate legislative oversite. The commission members should be appointed in a fair manner with nominees from both parties. There should be term limits. Any plan should be for a reasonable time period, certainly not 15 years.\ We must balance the need to repair and condition existing roads with building new ones in areas of larger growth. Money should not be diverted from the intended use. It is my understanding that MoDOT has been authorized to use up to $2.5 billion in bonds. My initial thought is to use them, since it is cheaper to build the roads and bridges now than to wait for the costs to rise. Also, there is the safety factor that needs to be considered for our citizens.\ Web site: www.diannbomkamp.com\ Chris Schuster\ No response received\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 83\ Barbara Fraser\ Incumbent, is unopposed\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 84\ Stella Ann Madison\ No response received\ Allen Icet\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 45\ Home: Wildwood\ Occupation: Engineer, Monsanto\ Political Experience: Rockwood School Board, 1994-1996\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ The first step would be to use a more realistic consensus revenue estimate. Overly optimistic revenue estimates set the stage for future spending problems. Accountability of the budget should be strengthened through more legislative oversight. A thorough review of the state budget in which priorities are ranked so that less effective programs can be eliminated is crucial. Long term, eliminating the concept of ""core"" budgets and getting to a zero- based budget will set our state on a sound financial footing.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ I would support legislation that would reduce the tax and regulation burden on families and businesses in my district.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ A number of steps need to be undertaken. An attempt to ""depoliticize"" the Department of Transportation is important. Appointing people to the Highway Commission who have some pertinent background in transportation issues can accomplish this. Eliminating the diversion of highway funds to other state agencies is a step in the right direction. Possibly setting a fixed amount to be transferred from the general revenue is an idea worth pursuing.\ Web site: www.allenicent.com\ Anthony S. Gianino\ No response received\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 85\ Michael R. Allen\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 43\ Home: St. Louis County\ Occupation: Attorney, self-employed\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ Close corporate loopholes - keep the funding in Missouri - and reduce government waste. Money is needed for public education and health care for seniors.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ To secure better schools, increase economic development by securing new good-paying jobs, reward existing businesses in the state to keep them from leaving and to secure better health care for our seniors.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Research the issue of toll roads, making it possible to get some tax relief from drivers of out-of-state vehicles. Review the reasons why people are conviced that MODOT does not handle its money well. This is a common theme when I walk door to door.\ Jim Lembke\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 41\ Home: St. Louis County\ Occupation: Business manager/development director, Providence Christian Academy\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ In the past 10 years, our state's budget has more than doubled. I will advocate a complete audit of every program and line item in our state budget. I want to ensure that we are being good stewards of the people's money.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ I would seek property tax relief for seniors, to exempt pensions and Social Decurity from state income tax, and to create a ""Classroom Trust Fund"" for our public schools.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The state's next step should be to entrust the responsibility to the Legislature to develop a plan and hold the Legislature accountable. Our state's infrastructure is an important and legitimate function of good government. I will support a plan that is responsible and serves the taxpayers well.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 86\ Shirley ""Shirl"" Garhart\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 76\ Home: Clayton\ Occupation: Retired English teacher\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ We must be as fiscally responsible as possible, first and foremost. We should change the Hancock Amendment to deal realistically with economic downturns. We must look for corporate loopholes and plug them. We must be frugal in hard times and make hard choices.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Education is my top priority. Even though most schools are good, we need to make sure they are top-notch. We need at least one nationally certified teacher in each building to mentor and encourage others to learn new skills. Legislators must make sure that schools have full funding. The people in District 86 have better access to health care than those in less affluent areas. Only one or two have brought it up while I have been canvassing. Still, this is a real need in the state.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Transportation must be improved so that people and goods are safe and not delayed on the road. We must work on legislation which allows the issuance of bonds for the building and repair of roads. The past record of the Department of Transportation has filled many with misgivings, but we must work out a realistic plan that will be adhered to. This will require negotiation with the state Highways & Transportation Commission. We must make sure their plans are based on accurate, full information and are prioritized.\ Jane Cunningham\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: Yes\ Age: 56\ Home: Chesterfield\ Occupation: Marketing director, England & Co. Case Management and Rehabilitation Services, Inc.\ Political Experience: State representative, 86th District, 2001- 2002; Ladue School Board, 1989-1992.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ We need an overhaul of the budget process. It would be helpful to have an expert objective audit to make recommendations for changes. State employees regularly alert legislators of problems and ideas for improvement -- these suggestions should be included in the discussions. All government programs should meet a three ""E's"" test: be Essential, Effective and Efficient.\ Prioritize appropriation line items so funding of programs is not allocated on an arbitrary basis. Privatize essential services when government bureaucracies have proved ineffective or inefficient.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ 1. Work for effective and efficient government with limited taxes.\ 2. Require fairness and relief from inequitable and/or overburdensome property taxes. St. Louis County residents subsidize rural school districts because the education funding formula is based on property assessments, and our assessment process is more aggressive than anywhere else in the state.\ 3. Send gambling revenues directly to schools on a per-pupil basis. Institute results-oriented education: Build accountability with funding that rewards achievement and expands options for families by providing access to schools that match student abilities and needs.\ 4. Support policies which foster a vibrant business environment and attract jobs.\ 5. Ensure that roads, highways and bridges meet economic, population and safety demands.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Voters have sent the message that higher taxes are unacceptable, especially when accountability of the funds is in question. Highways and roads are an essential government function that should be treated as such. We need to begin by responding to the voters' message to restore trust and to end the diversion of transportation funds to unrelated government departments and agencies.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 87\ Marilyn Morton\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 61\ Home: Warson Woods\ Occupation: Retired teacher\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ In order to improve the state's financial difficulties, we need to close corporate tax loopholes, because corporations are not paying their fair share. In doing so, we would increase revenue for the state. With the crisis in corporate accountability we have seen with Enron and WorldCom, we need to make sure working families do not suffer an increased tax burden, by holding corporations accountable.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ As a classroom teacher for more than 30 years, I understand the importance of a quality education for all children. As state representative, I would support continued funding for public schools, kindergarten through college. I would fight for smaller class sizes, programs to attract and keep the best teachers, and increased community involvement in our schools.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The state should increase its investment in maintaining existing roads instead of spending money to build new roads in outlying suburban areas. The state should also increase funding for mass transit projects such as MetroLink expansion. By investing in these projects, the state will help to slow suburban sprawl.\ Catherine L. Hanaway\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: Yes\ Age: 38\ Home: Warson Woods\ Occupation: State representative\ Political Experience: State representative since 1998; House Minority Leader since 2000.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ Our financial situation must be addressed by limiting the growth in government and focusing on the essential services of state government: education, law enforcement, helping Missouri's neediest citizens and transportation. Last year, I convened a panel of private sector experts on budgeting. I believe we need to implement many of their recommendations, including performance-based budgeting, so that we are sure we get results from our investment in vital services; cleaning up the excesses found by the state auditor; and capping the growth in departmental budgets while giving department directors the flexibility to spend scarce dollars more efficiently and effectively.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Creation and retention of jobs in Missouri. Last year, we lost 61,000 jobs in Missouri, more than any other state. Losing a job is devastating to a family. There is no state program that can provide the same security, independence and well-being as a job. We are driving jobs out of this state with frivilous lawsuits, disproportionately expensive workers' compensation insurance and claims costs, and a tax code that is overly complex.\ Essential to good jobs in Missouri are quality public schools. Most St. Louis County schools have not received any increase in state funding since 1993. We need to keep the promise of the gambling money and send it directly to every school district in the state on a per-pupil basis and hold schools accountable for results.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Missourians didn't reject Prop B because they don't think we need better and safer roads. Missourians rejected Prop B because they don't believe that increases in gas and sales taxes will go to better and safer roads. We have to restore accountability to MoDOT. There are four important steps we should take immediately:\ * End the diversion of transportation dollars away from transportation projects and to other state departments.\ * Depoliticize the highway commission so that projects are built based on need not on political clout.\ * Build what's promised. Too often planned projects are announced and never built. People's confidence will only be restored when MoDOT does what it says it's going to do.\ * Appoint an independent Inspector General with law enforcement tools to root out waste, fraud and abuse.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 88\ Elizabeth Theiss\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 65\ Home: Ballwin\ Occupation: Homemaker\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ I would work toward repealing the Hancock Amendment so that the state does not have to return money when revenues are below budget needs. How much did it cost the state to return those little checks? Also, refrain from undertaking new initiatives unless means of funding are defined and approved.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Education -- repealing the hold harmless classification, plus highways, prescription drugs for seniors, women's health issues and equal rights and opportunities for all citizens.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Reorganize MoDOT to make the director directly accountable to the governor for how funds are spent. Set priorities for projects and do not begin more than there are funds to complete. Avoid the diversion of money approved for highway construction to other MoDOT uses.\ Neal C. St. Onge\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: Yes\ Age: 47\ Home: Ballwin\ Occupation: Self-employed grading contractor\ Political Experience: Missouri House, 2000-2002; Rockwood School Board, 1995-1998.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ A zero-based budget process would be a good start. We need to take a limited number of departments or programs every year and examine their budgets from a zero base. This would give us a better opportunity to make responsible and meaningful adjustments. Once we implement a revised budget process, the state should do everything it reasonably can to honor its commitments.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ We need to adjust the state's education formula. The school districts in my area, Rockwood and Parkway, do not receive an equitable portion of state funding because they are considered wealthy districts. The foundation formula must be adjusted to be fair for all schools, whether urban, suburban or rural.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ We must restore voter confidence in the transportation system. MoDOT mus be made more accountable, the legislature needs to end the practice of diverting road money to other departments, and we need to set realistic, responsible goals for highway maintenance and repairs. Prop B's defeat sent a clear message -- voters don't trust the system.\ Web site: www.nealstonge.org\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 89\ George D. Weber\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 77\ Home: Eureka\ Occupation: Retired/self employed\ Political Experience: State Representative, 11th District, 1964.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ I live almost next door to Rockwood school headquarters. I would hope to be the conduit of service or information at any time. So right now, education would be high in my priorities.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ One step would be to develop laws which would possibly lead to less usage of state resources.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The voters have clearly shown they want ""no new taxes."" But perhaps, if a proposal is written for highway use only, no Hhighway Patrol or buildings, it might have possibilities.\ Web site: www.georgedweber.com\ Jack Jackson\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 59\ Home: Wildwood\elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ First, we need to do what is necessary to get our economy moving again. Second, we need to cut the waste in government. Third, we need to scrutinize every proposed program to determine if it is really necessary and best done by government.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Being a good steward of the taxpayer's money and finding ways that government can do more with fewer taxes.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ First of all, our highways need attention right now. I believe the failure of Proposition B reflects the concern taxpayers have with the way our state government and MoDOT have handled the funds in their charge. Demonstrated fiscal responsibility is the first order, followed by a reasonable program for financing the needed improvements.\ Web site: www.jackjackson.org\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 91\ Scott Sifton\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 28\ Home: Shrewsbury\ Occupation: Attorney, Blackwell Sanders Peper Martin, LLP\ Political Experience: Affton School Board, April 2001\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ The challenges faced with the state budget are part cyclical, part structural. Encouraging long-term economic growth is by far the best remedy for the state's financial difficulties. We cannot sit idly by and wait for better times, however. We need to keep investing in education in order to give the state's economy the best chance for long-term growth. What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ My top priority is to obtain an inflationary increase in funding for local school districts, which receive the same funding per pupil from the state today as in 1992. As a result, property taxpayers now shoulder a much larger burden for keeping up with school salaries and building needs. The inflationary increase would be funded by revenue growth, not a tax increase. Our current representative passed up a great opportunity to bring millions of dollars to Hold Harmless districts like Webster Groves, Kirkwood and Affton (HB 1711).\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ We need to get the Missouri Department of Transportation on the road to accountability. Missouri has critical transportation infrastructure needs, but the failure of Proposition B shows voters want accountability before they will be willing to invest more in transportation. This is the Show Me state, and voters need to be shown accountability before they will reach into their pocketbooks to invest in transportation.\ Web site: www.scottsifton.com\ Kathlyn Fares\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: Yes\ Age: 60\ Home: Webster Groves\ Occupation: State representative and Fares Interior Furnishings, a family business.\ Political Experience: State representative, 200; Jefferson Township Republican Committeewoman, 1996 and 2000.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ We need to look at the economic downturn as a challenge and find ways to provide necessary services more efficiently and to eliminate programs that are not necessary or are not successful. For revenue. the state should improve the business climate in order to stem the tide of businesses leaving or downsizing and to encourage new business start-ups or relocations to our state, especially our region. This will take housing, transportation improvement, leisure activity development, and an educated and trained work force. Cooperation of the educational and business communities to provide integrated and ongoing education and skill development will also be needed.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Property tax relief and achieving fairer state education funding for our schools tie for the district's top priority position. We need to build on the steps taken to address property tax fairness this year at the county and state levels. I will again file two related bills: ""statewide certificate of value"" legislation to achieve a common denominator in property assessment whether an assessor is elected or appointed as well as a bill that broadens the eligibility for income tax credits for property tax relief. Our district schools are receiving funding based on a 1993 formula; I will encourage continuing our interim committee work to revise and update the formula and secure the gambling money to districts on a per-pupil basis.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The failure of Proposition B emphasized the need to restore accountability, stop the diversion of transportation monies and establish and promote a realistic and attainable goal of new projects, while adequately maintaining the roads and bridges that we have. As the center of cross-country transportation, we can offer the necessary transportation amenities to keep commerce flowing into our state or watch it less conveniently circumvent Missouri as we continue to lose jobs and revenue as a result. More attention needs to be paid to mass transit.\ Web site: home.att.net/farescampaign/fares/index.html\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 92\ M. Julie Maguire\ No response received.\ Charles ""Chuck"" Portwood\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: Yes\ Age: 39\ Home: Ballwin\ Occupation: Chiropractic physician, self-employed\ Political Experience: State representative, 92nd District, 2000- 2002.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ We must continue to exercise fiscal restraint and end the decade of excessive government spending. We must complete an exhaustive review of state government and its bureaucratic departments. Throwing more money into a system that is inefficient is not responsible to those people who receive services nor to the people who pay for them. In addition, we must work to make the state more business-friendly so our jobs and tax dollars stay in Missouri.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ As the leader of property tax reform in the Legislature and founder of Missourians for Real Tax Reform, I will continue my fight to cap property taxes for our senior citizens and limit the growth of property taxes for homeowners under 65 years old to 5 percent every two years. With more than 100,000 signatures collected statewide from my grassroots initiative petition, I feel confident my property tax reform plan is still the No. 1 issue for my constituents.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Like education, transportation needs to become a top priority in the Legislature. Ten years ago, we spent 17 percent of the state's budget on transportation. Today we spend less than 9 percent. What other programs have displaced the transportation budget? The voters clearly have stated we want to see accountablity and efficiency before they will ever consider another tax increase. Making the highway commision accessible and accountable to the Legislature is the first step in restoring public trust in our system.\ Web site: www.chuckportwood.com\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 93\ William J. Konecnik\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 59\ Home: Fenton\ Occupation: Co-owner, That One Place bar and grill\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ Monitor state spending to ensure there isn't any waste. Eliminate duplications to save money. Provide incentives for businesses to move into Missouri, providing more jobs and a better tax base.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Ensure that K-12 education is fully funded. Provide consumer protection for the elderly against fraud.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ State needs to prove to the voters that the 5-cent gas tax passed several years ago is being used for highways. This was to be used in addition to -- not instead of -- normal state funding for highways. The state needs to prioritize projects and improve its image.\ Jodi A. Stefanick\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 28\ Home: Ballwin\ Occupation: Financial health care consultant, Washington University School of Medicine\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ I am committed to controlling the growth of our state budget by instituting a zero-based or performance-based budgeting system, placing expiration dates on more state programs, and prioritizing programs most important to making Missouri a better state for its citizens.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ I would work to bring real property tax relief to my constituents. I will pursue this goal by fighting for legislation that limits the amount that property assessments can grow to a factor like the Consumer Price Index; in addition, I would work to protect seniors by freezing their property assessments. What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Missouri voters sent a clear message that they would not support committing more tax dollars to the Department of Transportation. MoDOT can improve the public's perceptions of its programs by welcoming more accountability and oversight. Another improvement would be to stop the diversion of transportation funds to programs and agencies that fall outside of the immediate scope of roads and bridges.\ STATE REPRESNETATIVE DISTRICT 94\ Richard G. Byrd\ Is unopposed.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 95\ Joseph A. Rathert\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 39\ Home: Sunset Hills\ Occupation: Attorney\ Political Experience: Alderman, city of Sunset Hills, 2000, 2002\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ With a $19 billion budget, the answer is not additional taxes but instead reducing government waste. Missouri voters passed riverboat gambling some 10 years ago, yet not all of the proceeds are going to education as promised. Tax increment financing laws are not being used for their assigned purposes. Hold the government accountable much like a family is held accountable at the end of the month when they pay their bills.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ With the recent enormous increase in property tax assessments. I would place a freeze on property taxes for those who are 65 and older and place a maximum percentage raise for those under 65.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Proposition B failed because it was the wrong time for additional taxing of the citizens based upon the economy and because the tax included an increase in the sales tax and not just the gas tax. Missouri is seventh in the country in the number of roads that it has and yet near the bottom in the funding of those roads. Pressure should be placed on the federal government to increase its contribution.\ Web site: www.joerathert.com\ Jim Avery\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 31\ Home: Crestwood\ Occupation: Sales and set-up of modular equipment\ Political Experience: Student body president, University of Missouri-St. Louis, President Gravios Republican Township Club, 2002.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ We need to return accountability to all of the departments in our state by eliminating wasteful spending. Our governor tells us we are in a financial crisis and that we needed to dip into the rainy day fund. Our state is not in a budget crisis; we are in a spending crisis. Our state budget has more than doubled in the last 10 years, but our schools have not doubled in performance and our roads are not twice as good.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Fix the assesment process that is hurting many of our citizens. The very first bill I will introduce will be a bill that reduces property assesments to 5 percent or the rate of inflation. For those 65 or older, I want to freeze their property assesments. I also support a classroom trust fund that would take the casino revenues and distribute them on a per-pupil basis.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The failure of Prop B should send a message to the Department of Transportation that they need to create fiscial responsibility and accountability. I think MoDOT should have an immediate audit of its records. We need to fix any existing problems before we undertake building new roads and bridges.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 96\ Patricia Yaeger\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 60\ Home: St. Louis County\ Occupation: Night manager, Schnuck Markets Inc.\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ Missouri does have a shortfall in revenues created by several factors, including a $90 million drop in revenues from capital gains taxes. Economically, the times we are facing today are very different from those of even a few years ago. We must re-examine the Hancock Amendment, understanding that a lid on spending must be created. We need to conserve surplus revenues in a good year to help all Missourians during the lean years.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Economic development, particularly of business corridors and old, abandoned industrial sites, is one of the primary issues facing the 96th District. We must find ways to enhance the business corridors to attract small, growing businesses to our communities. We must also find ways to utilize old industrial sites, turning them into revenue- and job-producing locations which support the families, school districts and communities.\ Jim Stonebraker\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 51\ Home: St. Louis County\ Occupation: Web programmer/designer, proffesional musician\ Political Experience: Director, Lemay Fire Protection District, since April 1999.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ Conduct impartial means testing of every state program from top to bottom and then eliminate expenditures that are wasteful or redundant. Introduce zero-sum budgeting to all state programs.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ A complete revamp of the foundation formula for funding our public schools. It is time that the state distributes education funds on a per-pupil basis to all school districts. St. Louis County schools have not benefited from the promises made by the state to spend gambling revenue on education. County residents have their taxes raised year after year. Seniors are being driven from their homes because of such a disastrous policy. Missourians deserve tax relief -- not a larger tax burden.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ A long-term plan for roads, bridges and infrastucture should be adopted and then placed as a line-item in the state's yearly budget. The Executive and Legislative branches could then prioritize projects that are the most important.\ Web site: www.jimstonebraker.com\ Ronald E. Levy\ Party: Libertarian\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 73\ Home: Affton\ Occupation: Retired\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ The state should not be paying Medicaid payments for 42 percent of childbirths in Missouri.\ The state should combine all taxes into an income-only source tax.\ All state spending on programs should be adjusted on a month-to- month basis to actual monthly income basis.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ A constitutional amendment (like California's Proposition 13 enacted in 1978) that caps reassessment increases at 2 percent or less per year to the purchase price of a home of the current property owner. Then, for each year after purchase, upgrading the assessed value of homes to the 2 percent or less cap (for tax purposes only). It will take 50 years or more to double the assessed value of a home or double the current taxes on homes.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Missouri should promote toll roads connecting major cities with private money building them. Missouri should push for free public bus transportation in major populous areas to cut down the cost of expanding more lanes on highways for more automobiles. Money saved or earmarked for highway expansion could be used for maintenance of existing roads and bridges.\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 97\ Jane E. Koeller\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 58\ Home: St. Louis County\ Occupation: Distribution specialist, Gateway Intermodal\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ By law, Missouri must have a balanced budget, although loopholes were closed and services were cut during last years' study of the state financial situation. We will have to re-evaluate in the upcoming session. We need to look toward economic development, perhaps using the Rainy-Day Fund and perhaps even revising the Hancock Amendment.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ 1. Improve health care through the introduction of a wellness program. We need to improve health care also by encouraging health care professionals to stay in the profession.\ 2. Study alternative plans for helping seniors with property tax assessments.\ 3. To work with the education committee to improve state funding for our school district, which is a ""hold harmless"" district.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The defeat of Proposition B reflects the distrust many Missourians have in the Missouri Department of Transportation. We should work with regional transportational planning authorities. MoDOT must regain the trust of Missourians.\ Walt Bivins\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 63\ Home: St. Louis County\ Occupation: Retired\ Political Experience: Mehlville School Board, two terms.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ The state's budget should be designed so that expenditures do not exceed revenues. In the event anticipated revenues fall short, department heads should be required to report to the governor where they will bring expenditures into balance with revenues available to their departments and programs.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Property tax increases are an increasing burden to St. Louis County citizens. Legislation should be enacted to ensure that assessments are capped at some level. The maximum of a 5 percent increase has been proposed and may well be the appropriate maximum. The designation as hold harmless school district has placed an unfair burden on property owners in my area. Hold harmless revenues should be increased each year by at least the same rate as the Consumer Price Index. To continue to fund hold harmless schools at 1993 levels is unfair to a district's children and taxpayers.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ During times of financial downturns, businesses are frequently retired to cancel consultants' contracts. While it is unfortunate, MoDOT has taken this action as a prudent cost-cutting measure. By concentrating on highway maintenance, the department seems to be taking the appropriate approach at this time. The legislature should study financing new highway projects through utilizing user-based fees.\ Allen Glosson\ Party: Libertarian\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 39\ Home: St. Louis County\ Occupation: Software engineer, Reuters\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ In order to improve the economic health of the state, it is necessary to provide a climate conducive to business growth. To that end, I would propose the elimination of all taxes on businesses. After all, businesses don't pay taxes, their customers do -- that means you and me. Corporate income and franchises taxes only account for about two percent of the state budget, a small fraction of the total, but eliminating these taxes would likely save the state quite a bit in enforcement costs as well as saving the affected businesses even more.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ My top legisative priority would be to make sure that every program imposed by the state government comes with an automatic sunset provision, requiring explicit review and legislative renewal based on goals which can be objectively measured. Reauthorization of temporary taxes should be put to a public vote.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ First of all, the state should relax a number of regulations which make construction and maintenance of roads much more expensive than they should be. Next, the law governing gasoline formulations should be changed to allow any formulation which meets the desired air quality goals, not simply a prescribed formula. This would lower the price and allow additional gasoline user fees to be attached to the price of a gallon of gasoline. This would increase funding for roads and bridges while keeping the cost of gasoline roughly the same.\ Web site: www.aglosson.freeservers.com/campaign.html\ William Kloeppel\ Write-in candidate\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 98\ Tom Herbst\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 57\ Home: Union\ Occupation: Franklin County Clerk\ Political Experience: Franklin County clerk, since 1986; Franklin County treasurer, 1976-86; Union alderman, 1973-76.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ The first step is to determine what caused the deterioration of the state's financial situation. Without having the inside information necessary to answer the cause and effect, determining a specific solution is difficult. The Legislature and executive branch must become more accountable. Then they must take steps in concert with private enterprise to increase and improve our industrial and business base within the state.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Stabilization of the cost of prescription medication. I would propose that the current plan be expanded by increasing the ceiling on earnings.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Before anything else can be done, the Legislature must scrutinize itself and the Department of Transportation in order to determine what can be done to enhance credibility and accountability with our citizens.\ Brad D. Nieves\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 37\ Home: Washington\ Occupation: Small-business owner, Nieves Enterprises International\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ First and foremost we need to send energetic new blood to our Capital ... for a change. This will allow us to bring some accountability to Jefferson City. Our state budget has gone from $9 billion to $19 billion in less than 10 years, and they still say it's not enough! We must do a review of how all this money is being spent, and cut out the waste. When we cut out the waste, we will be in a better position to evaluate and prioritize what our actual, real-life budget needs are. Some of our trained politicians believe the answer is always to take money from the people. They call it taxes, but when it goes toward wasteful spending, I call it taking. Let's stop taking from the people, and concentrate on serving the people.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Again, sending energetic new blood to Jefferson City will allow us to see more common-sense legislation instead of business-as- usual politics. I will work hard every day to make sure that we cap the property/real estate taxes for our seniors and that we create a classroom trust fund to ensure that the gaming money goes directly to our schools. We need a better prescription drug plan for Missouri and tougher laws for criminals convicted of methamphetamine production. These issues all go right back to accountability and the need for energetic new blood ... For a change!\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The overwhelming failure of Proposition B proved that Missourians don't feel that our government can be trusted with more of their hard-earned dollars. Sending energetic new blood to our capital will show the politicians that we want our government to show us they can be trusted to invest our dollars as promised, instead of spending them and just asking for more!\ Web site: www.citizensfornieves.com\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 100\ Sue Schoemehl\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 48\ Home: St. Louis County\ Occupation: Wellness consultant, self-employed\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ In the last legislative session, many services were cut to balance the budget. We will need to review any loopholes that were overlooked and consider using the Rainy Day Fund and perhaps revising the Hancock Amendment. I would work to increase economic development so that it would increase the economy and mean more jobs to Missourians.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ * Increase funding to hold harmless school districts so that districts like the Mehlville School District get their fair share of state funding.\ * Increase the maximum amount of income allowed to qualify for circuit breaker or property tax relief.\ * Work for legislation to free our neighborhoods of illegal drugs and violence.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ Make an honest assessment of properties currently owned and see if the need to keep these properties is logical, due to cutbacks on future projects. Adequately maintain the current infrastructure so the roads we have do not deteriorate. Work with the resources they have.\ Michael P. Rohrbacker\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 30\ Home: St. Louis County\ Occupation: Vice president of sales, Maze Communications\ Political Experience: St. Louis Community College Board of Trustees, 1996, re-elected 2002\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ I will sponsor legislation for a zero-based government growth initiative, similar to what they have done in Texas and Georgia. This will force state government to prioritize spending and encourage budget accountability. Furthermore, this will end the duplication and waste in administration and delivery of services. All essential services will be streamlined and better maintained.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ My top priority is to pass a prescription drug fairness plan that will relieve the burden on seniors, those with disablities, and fixed-income families and make prescription drugs affordable. Over the years, I have helped my mother and father manage their diabetes. I am concerned that many seniors are forced to choose between buying medications or eating for the week! These drug companies are being subsidized by our tax dollars, and they return the favor by gouging us with huge profit margins.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ I support the state using the sale of rolling bonds to fund the necessary improvements for transportation. I would also push for the Department of Transportation to streamline by cutting their administration expenses and increase funding for more pro-active programs that will slow the deteriation of our roads.\ Web site: www.rohrbacker.com\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 105\ Harold R.

Promote a bipartisan legislative task force to work with the office of administration, to identify Missouri's most pressing needs.\ 2. Foster the idea of funding by priority.\ 3. Target a reduction of state expenditures equal to 2 percent of the total state budget.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Introduce legislation for reforms in methods of real and personal property tax assessments, so as to prevent the taxes (value) on your personal residence and contents from being increased more than the Consumer Price Index annually. (A homestead protection, similar to what other states have.)\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The Missouri Legislature must recognize the need for a modern, safe and efficient transportation system. It is not just a matter of convenience, but one for the state's economic survival. It must be given legislative priority.\ Kevin Threlkeld\ No response received\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 110\ Belinda Harris\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 51\ Home: Hillsboro\ Occupation: Farmer, self-employed\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ 1. The boom years of the late '90s created excessive spending on old and new programs. Now, with a depressed economy and a loss of revenue, we need to get back to the basics and start with the original, essential state programs.\ 2. Next, evaluate new programs and the expanded old programs, to determine their effectiveness and success, and then fund accordingly.\ 3. We need to cut wasteful spending in unproductive areas of the government. If cuts are necessary, I would spread them more evenly. All divisions can withstand small cuts, instead of few departments taking drastic cuts.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ I would support new programs that decrease the high school dropout rate, provide better enviromental protection of trageted areas, promote new technologies that are more environmentally friendly and offer incentives for small businesses in rural areas. I would also support legislation to increase dentist and chiropractors in rural areas, by allowing these professions to have the same financial program that medical doctors have for locating in rural areas. (Help pay college expenses in exchange for working in rural areas.)\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ The present gas tax can maintain the highways and do some new work in the immediate future, but the higher-cost projects will have to be put off until new revenue increases. Projects need to be prioritized so that the most needed come before those based on political influence. For the future, I would support a smaller gasoline-tax increase, but not a sales tax.\ Connie Sayers\ Party: Republican\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 52\ Home: Potosi\ Occupation: Bison rancher/small business owner, Self-employed\ Political Experience: Republican Central Committee femal member, Liberty Township, Washington County, 2002.\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ 1. I would review the core budget to delete the unnecessary expenditures.\ 2. Then I would cut all programs by 2 1/2 percent, except for education, health care and transportation.\ 3. I would put a freeze on rehiring those positions that are vacated by attrition and are not essential.\ What specific actions would you seek to help your district?\ Re-evaluate how education is financed. Property taxes are not adequate to fund education in rural areas where there is little to no industry.\ Review the impact that HB1111 will have on our citizens and see how we might compensate, to assure we have a safety net for our most vulnerable citizens.\ Review highway and bridge plans to see if we have some specific areas of need that should be brought to the top of the list. Two areas would be highways accessing the new landfill and the Hillsboro bypass, as well as access to De Soto and Potosi.\ What should the state do now about transportation issues?\ We need to make a step-by-step priority list, with an attached budget. We will then appropriate what we can from the 6 cent gas tax from 1992 (that is still being collected), we cut expenses where we can (review MoDOT), go to the people with a definitive offer with roads, dates and costs, and stick to it. Don't overpromise, stick to the budget, and live up to the promises.\ Web site: www.sayers4staterep.com\ STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 111\ Bob Trokey\ Party: Democrat\ Incumbent: No\ Age: 67\ Home: Sullivan\ Occupation: Retired educator with Ph.D. in education\ Political Experience: Never elected to public office\ What would you do about the state's financial difficulties?\ 1.

Reorganize and restructure MoDOT.\ 2. Call for independent audit of MoDOT spending.\ 3. Allocate all transportation funding back to transportation. (i.e: the 6-cent gas tax to MoDOT, not to other departments. This may take several years to complete.)\ 4. Develop a statewide vision for transportation. (i.e: the 15- year plan)\ 5. Reduce the amount of time from conception to completion of projects. From 10 years plus, to 3 to 5 years.\ 6. Identify where dollars are now being spent.\ 7.

(CNN) -- A barge collision near New Orleans spilled oil into the Mississippi River on Friday, prompting authorities to close a five-mile stretch of the waterway.
\
The St. Charles Parish Department of Waterworks shut down both of its water intakes located in New Sarpy and Luling because of the spill, but said the incident did not pose a public threat.
\
The area had been reopened, with some restrictions, by Friday afternoon as investigators continued to assess the damage, officials said.
\
No injuries have been reported, and preliminary estimates put the spill at less than 10,000 gallons of crude oil. Response agencies have remained on the scene.
\
The spill was started after a tanker barge towed by a motorized vessel, Settoon, ran into a construction barge towed by the tugboat Alydar just before 2 a.m. Friday near Reserve in St. John Parish, west of New Orleans.
\
U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman Lt. Suzanne Kerver said the tanker barge suffered a 10 feet by 5 feet gash above the water line, allowing crude oil to spill out of the 214,000-gallon tank.
\
The leak has since been contained, said Lt. Paul Rhynard, also of the Coast Guard.
\
Oil Mop, a contracted cleanup company, was on the scene and has deployed 100 feet of boom, Kerver said.
\
""One of our priorities is to facilitate the safe continuation of commercial traffic,"" said Coast Guard Capt. Pete Gautier. ""Safety is paramount, and the unified command is working to minimize the impact this spill has on people, the environment and commerce.""

176,"
MIAMI - New Englander Paul Tsongas is making a stand in faraway Florida to avert a Southern rout on Tuesday that could badly damage his quest for the Democratic presidential nomination.
\
Tsongas, a former senator from Massachusetts, heaved furious volleys this weekend in Florida to combat Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's superior organization and advantages of running in his native region.
\
""Bill Clinton will do anything to be elected president, including distorting my record and covering up his own,"" Tsongas said Saturday.
\
Clinton could surge toward the nomination by sweeping the South. He is trying to dampen Tsongas' growing popularity in Florida by telling voters that Tsongas would cut Social Security benefits.
\
Clinton bases that charge on Tsongas' vote as a senator to limit cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients. Tsongas also suggested in a campaign booklet that benefits might need to be limited for high-income people.
\
Tsongas produced a newspaper story Saturday showing that Clinton, too, had favored limiting cost-of-living increases when he was the newly elected chairman of the National Governors Association in 1986.
\
""Polls are telling Bill Clinton that because of his own problems, the only way he can win is to destroy my credibility,"" Tsongas said.
\
In Florida, Tsongas has his best opportunity to break Clinton's hold on the predominantly Southern states that will hold primaries and caucuses in Tuesday's 11-state vote. Tsongas has closed the gap with Clinton in Florida recently; a poll made public Friday showed the two in a dead heat, each with 24 percent.
\
The other Democratic aspirants, former Gov. Jerry Brown of California and Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, were far behind. More than 30 percent were undecided.
\
Clinton is favored in Northern Florida, which has a distinctly southern flavor. Tsongas is expected to run stronger in Tampa and other cities along Florida's heavily Republican central corridor because of his ""pro-business"" economic policies.
\
That leaves South Florida with its liberal voters, many of them older people transplanted from the Northeast, as a main Clinton-Tsongas venue for battle.
\
Tsongas' campaigning this weekend was his most aggressive since he began his quest almost a year ago.
\
On Friday night, he charged that that Clinton had endorsed building the Seawolf submarine chiefly as a means to attract voters in Connecticut, where the subs would be manufactured. He also accused Clinton of using an ethnic reference when he pronounced some of Tsongas' pro-business proposals as ""not American.""
\
A consultant for Clinton, James Carville, responded Saturday: ""I think {Tsongas} is going to tear a ligament there, that's such a stretch.""
\
Carville said that Tsongas had said nothing that would convince Clinton to back off his charges on Social Security.
\
Advisers to Clinton acknowledged that Florida presents the weakest link to achieving a sweep Southern states before candidates move to Illinois and Michigan on March 17.
\
Clinton reminded voters this weekend that Tsongas supports an increase in the gas tax; Tsongas says the tax hike is needed to conserve energy. Many people in Florida worry that a higher gas tax would make it harder for people to afford automobile travel and further depress the state's tourism industry.
\
""We will be panning for gold on the gas tax, and I think it will help,"" said Jeff Eller, Clinton's Florida campaign manager.
\
Earlier Saturday, Tsongas tried to combat his tepid support among black voters. Clinton has run strong among blacks in other primaries; he captured 70 percent of the black vote in winning Georgia last week and 55 percent of blacks while losing to Tsongas in Maryland, exit polls showed.
\
But Tsongas seemed to do little to help himself. He was met with disinterest bordering on hostility after arriving an hour late for a rally at a park in an urban neighborhood. Then, the low-key Tsongas had to follow speeches by several fiery black ministers filling time during the wait.
\
""Everybody's a brother. Everybody's a sister. We're linked to each other,"" Tsongas said.
\
Afterward, Ken Watson, who had come to register voters, said that Tsongas, ""needs to work on getting some style.""
\
Watson added: ""We're tired of politicians like him parachuting in here at election time and then airlifting right back out. It's like, 'yo, where did he come from'?""
\
T. Willard Fair, president of the Urban League of Miami, said that what little interest blacks in Florida were showing toward this year's Democratic candidates is directed at Clinton: ""People are tending to look at the decisions of a select few in our community when it comes to voting for president, and Bill Clinton was able to cash in on the pawnbrokers early.""
\
Gerald Austin, a Tsongas consultant and a former adviser to Jesse Jackson, acknowledged Tsongas' problem. But he asserted that a likely low turnout among Florida's blacks on Tuesday would diminish Clinton's advantage.
\
Tsongas scored heavily last week with another segment of voters when he corralled endorsements of most of Florida's environmental leaders, among them 101 year-old author Marjory Stoneman Douglas.
\
Although Florida's Cuban-American population remains strongly Republican, Tsongas made inroads recently into a new generation that is both anti-Fidel Castro and pro-environment. Tsongas opposes opening trade with Cuba.
\
Julio Fanjul, whose family owns vast sugar cane croplands in South Florida, said that he was attracted by Tsongas' early commitment to fight global warming. As a senator ten years ago, Tsongas sponsored hearings on the potential dangers of pollution gathering in the upper atmosphere, believed to cause warming around the world.

Will we step up as a region for soccer stadium?\With Missouri Gov. Mike Parson's expression of interest in a Major League Soccer stadium in our area, the question arises as it has before: will we step up as a two-state, multicounty region to support this important economic development initiative? Or will it once again be just one state with perhaps one county or city participating, a formula that failed with the earlier soccer stadium proposal and before that with a National Football League stadium?\Will the state of Illinois, St. Louis city, St. Louis County, St. Charles County and St. Clair County step up? After all, many soccer fans are residents of these jurisdictions. Or will they continue to be ""free riders"" on the backs of residents of the participating jurisdictions?\And will Bi-State and East-West Gateway, each with their regionwide economic development mandate (and Bi-State with its bonding authority), be helpful this time around? Or will they just sit it out as they have on prior opportunities that have screamed out for a truly regional approach?\It's time, folks, for regional leadership to emerge and make truly regional economic development happen with this soccer stadium opportunity and many more opportunities to come.\John Shapleigh - Clayton\
St. Louis voters already said no to soccer stadium\It doesn't matter in what situation you use the word or how it applies to each one, it always comes out to mean the same: No means no. I'm not sure what part of that word the elected people of the city of St. Louis don't understand, the ""n"" or the ""o.""\The voters of the city rejected the proposal for a soccer stadium in St. Louis once. Why has the subject been brought up again?\This city needs more important things first. I'm sure there is a whole list of things that could be mentioned, but that would be a waste of time. We already know what we need and what we don't have.\They never cease to amaze me with some of the logic they come up with to try and justify their proposals. I do know one thing: Not one person at City Hall is qualified to run this city. It's almost like a progressive day care center for adults.\I'm still waiting for the Ferris wheels promised to make St. Louis a world-class city.\Jim Kozlowski - St. Louis\
Gas tax money should go to repair existing infrastructure\I wish the proposed gas tax on the November ballot contained a provision that all revenue would go to the repair of existing infrastructure. In the past, a good bit of money was diverted to new projects of dubious value.\The Page Avenue Extension and Highway 67 from Fredericktown to Poplar Bluff are two examples. I remember an interview with a Missouri Department of Transportation official about Page Avenue in the 1990s. He said it would be very expensive and take a long time to pay for. Those driving Highway 67 from Fredericktown to Poplar Bluff may get the sense the highway was built just for them.\If the proposal passes, listen for the drums as town boomers start thumping for a new four lane through the wilderness somewhere.\Fix the bridges. Fix the roads. Pay off the debt. The rest can wait.\Ed Heisel - Labadie\
Schnucks helps the area by buying Shop 'n Save stores\It is unfortunate to hear any criticism of Schnucks' purchase of 19 Shop 'n Save stores, because shoppers wouldn't have their grocery store any more. It is a good thing that Schnucks is making it possible for those grocery stores to remain, and for employees to keep their jobs. Shop 'n Save is not keeping a presence in St. Louis, in any event.\Schnucks continues to play a vital role in the St. Louis economy, because they do reach out to every municipality.\Lecil Saller - St. Louis\
A light at the end of the tunnel for landfill's neighbors\The Franciscan Sisters of Mary are grateful for the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to move forward on their latest proposal to clean up the radioactive waste at West Lake Landfill. The proposed schedule of four and a half years provides a light at the end of a tunnel that has stretched on for decades. It is time.\We have collaborated closely and intensely with the Missouri Coalition for the Environment and Just Moms and other groups advocating for total cleanup of the landfill. While the current proposal falls short of complete excavation of the nuclear waste, we do feel it presents a viable option and encourage the EPA to move forward with it. The action will make a great difference in the environment here in Bridgeton and the St. Louis area. We applaud all those who have taken seriously the frightening consequences of simply leaving the radioactive waste in place.\Our sisters will continue to hold the twice-monthly prayer vigils in the Marian Chapel of The Sarah Community and on St. Charles Rock Road near the Bridgeton Landfill as a reminder of the dangers the landfills present to those who live nearby and to the region as a whole. We trust that the EPA will move forward swiftly to create a plan and then excavate what waste they can -- and will follow through on their intent to monitor groundwater and other indications of problems.\Our sisters moved to Bridgeton in 2010 just as the issues with West Lake were escalating because of the underground fire in the Bridgeton Landfill and its movement toward the radioactive wastes in the West Lake Landfill. The landfill issues are a problem that Bridgeton residents had no part in creating. Like our neighbors, we know that there is little time to spare, and we thank all those who have given us hope for a fair and decent resolution of the issues at West Lake.\Sister Judith A.

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. - In its nine-year history, Great Northwest Day at the Capitol participants have never been more cautious about asking for money from their lawmakers.
\
About 230 people from 18 counties attended events Monday, mostly information sessions, and a gala Monday evening where about 70 percent of the state's legislators got a glimpse of what communities are pushing.
\
""We're making sure we don't come here with a hand open,"" said Lee Langerock, co-chair of the annual event. ""We came with a message of 'let's work together to accomplish our goals.'""
\
The top goals for the group this year are transportation, economic development, life-long learning, and partnerships.
\
Shellby Hendee, director of economic development and moderator of a lunchtime panel on key issues the group wants to tackle, said in years past, pushing for funding was a component of what they were here to accomplish. But he addressed the ""elephant in the room"" (Missouri's budget shortfall) early in his opening remarks.
\
House budget chairman Ryan Silvey's sign near his office door, which basically says you're crazy if you've come to him requesting money, got a mention from Mr. Hendee. And budget issues were the first remarks from opening panelist Sen. Rob Mayer, president pro-tem of the Senate.
\
Ms. Langerock, who is also the economic development director for Nodaway County, said Great Northwest Day has taken on a different attitude. Participants are using the event not just as a platform to make their communities economic efforts known to lawmakers, but to make connections with residents in neighboring counties.
\
""We always have attendants who are engaged, who come to learn, but it seems like this year they're more tuned-in to what we're doing here and why we're here,"" she said, adding that the economic climate is helping to push the change.
\
Community partnering on potable water and sewers is something that will likely have to occur for rural towns to improve economic development, said Randy Railsback, executive director of Green Hills Regional Planning Commission.
\
He said state legislators need to push for federal funds that help those projects move forward.
\
Industries looking at rural areas for possible locations will insist on proper water lines and accessible roads. Mr. Railsback said we need more state support for more intergovernmental financing.
\
""There is going to be some legislation in the future that may have to happen to help communities do that,"" Mr. Railsback said.
\
Transportation came up twice in two different sessions Monday. At issue is a drastic decrease in revenue for road projects. It's of particular interest to Northwest Missouri communities where (Region 1) has been recognized as having the worst minor routes in the state. Dennis Heckman, a bridge engineer, said because of the more frequent freeze/thaw north of Interstate 70, roads need more maintenance. He said due to the state of Northwest Missouri roads, more money will be funneled there than to any other district.
\
But more is needed, said Mr. Railsback, and it will require money. He said Missourians, in order to take advantage of a federal highway bill, if it is reauthorized, will have to come up with 20 percent of the money. He said it would likely have to come from increased sales tax, gas tax, increased licensing fees, or all three.
\
""We have to make sure that whatever is proposed, it's not a partisan issue ... there aren't Republican highways, there aren't Democrat highways,"" he said. ""But if we don't act together, we won't be able to capture these federal dollars that may be available.""
\
Tye Parsons, executive director of the Northwest Missouri Regional Council of Government, said communities in our region face difficulties in that they have a smaller tax base, and according to 2010 census data, a shrinking population compared to the rest of the state.
\
""That should probably be a red flag to anybody sitting in this room,"" he said to 200-plus people at the Capitol Plaza Hotel ballroom.
\
Mentioning 911 programs and water treatment upgrades, Mr. Parsons also stressed the importance of partnerships between rural communities.
\
Ms. Langerock said they are in Jefferson City to make their message known and that not everything they push comes with a fiscal note.
\
""It's not always about money,"" she said, mentioning possible regulatory changes that create a more business-friendly environment in the state. ""We want to be here and let (legislators) know we're just as willing to push through and make things happen.""

179,"
AS SEN. BOB DOLE deals with complaints from fellow Republicans that he is doing a poor job framing a campaign against President Bill Clinton, he must endeavor to repair the tattered image of his own party.
\
While the Republican Party's woes have been clearly detailed in public opinion research dating back to last year's budget fights, many top Dole and GOP strategists were stunned at the depth of the dissatisfaction discovered at more than a dozen recent focus groups commissioned by the Republican National Committee.
\
Eager to help Senate Majority Leader Dole - and congressional Republicans - develop an aggressive election-year agenda, the party research included sessions with an array of critical constituencies, from Ross Perot voters, Roman Catholics and suburban women to Democrats who said their support for Clinton was weak and Republicans who defected to support Clinton against President George Bush four years ago.
\
Despite Clinton's 20-point lead in national polls, the research found considerable discomfort with him among swing voters who question the Democratic incumbent's honesty, commitment to principle and leadership skills.
\
But the findings also detailed the toll that last year's congressional debate took on the Republican Party's image, on issues from protecting Medicare and the environment, and the price Dole is paying for the GOP's poor standing.
\
""There is a huge anti-Washington feeling across all groups and geographical lines,"" said a senior Dole adviser who reviewed the focus group reports late last week.
\
""And a huge feeling that Newt Gingrich is the king of Washington. Dole personally rates better but is wearing the label of Republican Congress extremism around his neck right now.""
\
Dole himself has been careful not to blame Gingrich and his conservative House Republican caucus for his own plight in the polls.
\
But many allies are less reluctant to hide their dismay, particularly at the House GOP insistence on shutting down the government last year as part of the budget standoff.
\
""It is the fruit of the excesses of the revolution,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
\
GOP pollster Ed Goeas said, ""There is no question the image of the party needs some repairing, especially with swing voters. We do have to question our strategy of labeling this a Republican revolution. It put our opponents in a position to label us as radicals.""
\
Indeed, at one of the Republican Party focus groups in Knoxville, Tenn., one man made clear that he was no fan of Clinton. But when talk turned to the Republicans, he summed up his feelings this way: ""Gingrich ought to be shot.""
\
In group after group, words like ""extreme,"" ""radical"" and ""gone too far"" were used to describe the GOP Congress.
\
Gingrich, concerned that he has become a political problem for Dole and the entire Republican Party, is focusing more on fund raising these days and more carefully picking times to appear as a Republican spokesman. On Sunday, he appeared on a live news show for the first time in months.
\
The troubling data from the focus groups also has had other ramifications.
\
The Republican National Committee plans a major TV advertising effort at mid-month, and had planned to assail Clinton as a liberal hiding behind conservative rhetoric on such issues as taxes, welfare reform and crime.
\
But, after reviewing the data, top GOP strategists decided that the urgent task was boosting the Republican Party's standing. So new ads were ordered, focusing less on Clinton and more on promoting GOP values.
\
The data also are being used as fresh evidence by those who believe that it is essential for Dole to surrender day-to-day management of the Senate so that he can spend more time focusing on Clinton - and on broader themes to help the GOP image.
\
Several Senate colleagues have made this case to Dole in recent days, as have some top campaign aides and GOP National Chairman Haley Barbour, Senate Republican sources said. Gingrich said Sunday that Dole should turn over more authority to the GOP whip, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi.
\
Dole has at times indicated that he will step back but at other times has resisted doing so. In the next week, he will take the lead on two issues that Republicans believe offer him a chance to use his Senate perch to his advantage: efforts to repeal the 1993 gas-tax increase and to pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget.
\
""The dissatisfaction comes when Bob Dole is on the floor debating (Massachusetts Sen.) Ted Kennedy about things like the minimum wage,"" McCain said. ""As long as we control the agenda and are talking about things that can help, then I don't see it as a big problem.""
\
Some allies are pushing Dole to make it clear by the end of this month that he will limit his Senate role.
\
While it's uncertain that Dole will agree to that timetable, ""I think that it is inevitable,"" said Utah GOP Sen. Robert Bennett, a close Dole ally. ""He needs to pay more attention to the campaign.""
"
180,"
LIFE WILL BE ""greener"" under the Bill Clinton-Al Gore administration when it comes to energy and the environment.
\
But dramatic shifts in policy may not occur swiftly because of vexing choices and built-in resistance awaiting the new government.
\
By many accounts, this is a turning point: The shifting global economy, climate change and destruction of the atmosphere from pollution could compel a new, more sustainable way of living.
\
Some of the changes brewing could be as profound as those accompanying the end of the Cold War: weaning ourselves from foreign oil, shifting to solar power and renewable energy, eliminating waste in factories and in the home.
\
Vice President-elect Gore has talked of phasing out the internal combustion engine one day. Much sooner, he wants a Marshall Plan, or massive program, to clean up environmental messes around the world.
\
Clearly, the new generation in Washington has created many expectations.
\
""We are optimistic that this administration will take environmental issues very seriously and not present confrontation between environmental and economic goals, as in the past,"" said Christopher Flavin, vice president of Worldwatch Institute, an organization that advocates some new approaches.
\
Some of those who could feel the sting of new approaches are resigned to their inevitability.
\
Referring to stricter rules on pesticides, Chet Dickerson, Monsanto Co.'s director of agricultural affairs in Washington, said: ""Threat might not be the right word. It may be long-term reality.""
\
But questions remain as to how quickly things will, and should, change:
\
Clinton's Cautious Style
\
As a senator, Gore became an environmental advocate. But President-elect Clinton will be calling the shots, and he may not be so ambitious. As governor of Arkansas, he seldom put a priority on energy and the environment. Indeed, Arkansas' land and rivers suffered during Clinton's 12-year stewardship.
\
Rather than commanding change, Clinton is more likely to use market forces, such as urging industries to trade pollution credits to reduce industry-wide pollution. He is expected to consider tax incentives for energy conservation.
\
Carol M. Browner, Clinton's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency, worked during her confirmation hearing this week to mollify critics.
\
""The EPA should promote and encourage rewards for businesses that take the lead in developing pollution prevention and recycling strategies,"" she said.
\
Pollution-control advocates don't know what to expect. Clinton ""may turn out to behave more like a moderate Republican, at least at first,"" said Ken Cook, vice president of the Center for Resource Economics, which deals with environmental issues in farming. ""And that might be OK, since we have a lot of catching up to do.""
\
Mixed Signals
\
Clinton won praise from pollution-control advocates for picking Browner as EPA administrator and Bruce Babbitt as interior secretary. Browner fought to protect the Everglades as Florida's chief environmental officer; Babbitt, a former governor of Arizona, has headed the League of Conservation Voters.
\
But Clinton's choice of Hazel R. O'Leary as secretary of the Energy Department is a different story. As an executive of Northern States Power Co. of Minnesota, she has pushed coal-fired and nuclear power plants.
\
Her company was a partner in an ill-fated plan last year to build the coal-fired plant in Florida near Lake Okeechobee - a plan that Browner helped kill.
\
O'Leary has angered American Indians in Minnesota for campaigning personally to store more nuclear waste at her company's Prairie Island nuclear plant. The plant is adjacent to Sioux Indian land on an island in the Mississippi River.
\
""We really question why they would appoint someone who has been involved with the nuclear industry like this,"" said Tom Goldtooth, environmental coordinator for the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians in Minnesota.
\
New Ideas, Same Game
\
The administration and many members of Congress may be new. But the real power on Capitol Hill has changed little. Likewise, the lobbying that accompanies the perennial battles over natural resources has changed little.
\
If Clinton gets around to pushing higher fuel economy requirements for vehicles, he will have to contend with Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and protector of the auto industry.
\
When it comes to limiting oil use, Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., will have a lot to say. Likewise, Clinton's treasury secretary, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, did not look benevolently on providing tax incentives for renewable energy sources when he was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
\
""The danger is getting bogged down in some of the same old fights,"" remarked Flavin.
\
Little Money; Other Priorities
\
With another huge budget deficit looming, the Clinton-Gore administration will be strapped as far as innovations.
\
The EPA alone received $110 million this year from what was requested. And the price tag for cleaning up radioactive messes at defense plants around the country has grown by hundreds of millions.
\
Blake Early, a Sierra Club lobbyist, said that he is preparing to rely on more favorable interpretations of old laws rather than expecting new programs.
\
""I don't expect this administration to be lobbing out a lot of new initiatives,"" Early said.
\
Chet Dickerson, Monsanto Co.'s director of agricultural affairs in Washington, believes that the economy and health care will consume the brunt of attention in the early going.
\
""I don't think that the Clinton administration will want to jump into some of these controversial areas,"" Dickerson said. ""`Next year? Our jobs could be tougher.""
\
Even before taking office, Clinton's administration has signaled some of the likely changes. Natural gas is likely to be seen more favorably as an alternative to oil, coal and other fossil fuels, judging by Clinton's associates.
\
Lawyers who work for natural gas interests held influential positions in Clinton's transition planning. Clinton's chief of staff, Thomas F. ""Mack"" McLarty, until recently was chairman of Arkla Inc., a natural gas company.
\
Some environmental advocates have come to prefer clean-burning natural gas over some of the other fuels. But they worry that Clinton's administration might become so dependent on natural gas that it fails to provide sufficient incentives to speed the era of renewables.
\
Attitudes toward oil might be affected by the devastating spill this month in the North Atlantic that damaged the Shetland Islands. The accident occurred even as the oil industry was negotiating to water down hull standards for tanker ships.
\
""The disaster underscores our continuing vulnerability as a nation in relying on shipments of imported oil,"" observed Jack Doyle, an analyst with Friends of the Earth, an international organization.
\
Early in Clinton's term, energy policy may well be tax policy. As a presidential candidate, Clinton opposed a gasoline tax. But he recently said that he might accept a hike in the 14-cent federal gas tax if it were accompanied by tax breaks for the middle class.
\
Changing Decisions
\
Government agencies expect new ways of doing business and are making decisions that might be different two weeks from now.
\
Last week, the EPA approved a test-burn at a new hazardous waste incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio. Gore has made few waves during the transition. But he has asked for an investigation on why the government allowed the incinerator to be built.
\
Shortly after the November election, the Department of Agriculture relaxed rules covering outdoor testing of genetically engineered crops. And in November, the EPA dropped some of the rules for testing the effects of pesticides on birds and other creatures.
\
These decisions foreshadow struggles on the horizon. The biotechnology industry - which uses gene-splicing to create products - escaped new statutes that would govern it during the Reagan-Bush era. Instead, existing laws were modified to cover areas that were quite different from what Congress had in mind.
\
The industry now worries about more regulation from the Food and Drug Administration and less protection of patents under the new administration.
\
""Biotechnology is at a crucial stage in its development,"" Stephen A. Duzan, chairman of an industry trade association, wrote in a letter to Clinton this month.
\
Rules governing pesticides could be in for drastic overhaul. The new administration will be looking closely at a federal court decision in California that could require banning of many pesticides. In the so-called Delaney case, a federal court ruled that pesticides cannot be used if they have been shown to cause cancer in lab animals.
\
While chemical manufacturers could suffer, waste disposal operators may prosper under Clinton. The $1.5 billion air pollution control industry alone could grow 8 to 14 percent in the next few years, analysts say.
\
Waste disposal companies worry about curbs on waste burning and stricter rules for landfills and transportation. But they are optimistic about the business that may come their way under an administration concerned about pollution.
\
""What they're going to do is going to be a plus for us and anybody else who gets revenues dealing with environmental problems,"" said William Y. Brown, a vice president of Waste Management Inc., the biggest disposal company.
\
Stronger Enforcement
\
While taking it slow on new programs, Clinton's administration is likely to enforce regulations that have been delayed or ignored.
\
For instance, federal farming law requires those who farm erodable land to have conservation plans by next year in order to partake of subsidies, crop insurance and many federal programs. The provision has particular bearing in the hills of Missouri, where crops are planted on sloping land.
\
Similarly, advocates of sustainable farming are frustrated at roadblocks to shifting away from heavy chemical use. Another federal program that was established to certify organic farms couldn't operate very effectively last year: It received $15,000 from the administration of President George Bush.
\
Betty Bailey, director of the North Carolina-based Rural Advancement Fund, said that she was hoping for new policies that look to the future.
\
""Many things could be changed in the first 100 days,"" she said.
\
Wilderness advocates are breathing easier these days. They no longer worry about threats to millions of acres of wetlands contained in a proposal to change definitions. They are shifting now from defense to offense, planning for strong language in a newly drawn Endangered Species Act.
\
And Clinton, following through on a campaign promise, is preparing to hold a forest summit in the Northwest soon after becoming president. He will be stepping into a long-running fight about cutting trees.
\
Scott Feierabend of the National Wildlife Federation said he sees a new atmosphere along with the new approach that the Clinton-Gore team is bringing to town. Many industries fighting to protect jobs and subsidies might not agree.
\
Feierabend said, ""There seems to be a whole new mentality of cooperation rather than combativeness.""
"
181,"
A remarkable thing happened over the past two to three years: The collapse of communism and the victory in the Persian Gulf, which represent a spectacular victory for the values and the power of the West, were immediately followed by a collapse of American confidence and self-reliance.
\
This reaction is at least partly the result of the general acceptance of two myths. The first is the myth of government impotence and incompetence. The second is that we are broke.
\
And yet, our problems are not unsolvable; they are the direct result of our failure to adapt to the competitive requirements of a global economy:
\
(1) We have not invested adequately in new plants and in research and development to enable American workers to be more productive.
\
(2) We have not invested adequately in human capital to provide all Americans with the education and training required to fill the available jobs.
\
(3) We have not invested adequately to provide the infrastructure required by a modern industrial society.
\
The main reason for these failures is our unwillingness to pay for what we need. The result has been a national debt of $4 trillion, $400 billion deficits, a stagnating economy and an eroding standard of living for most Americans.
\
A more active role for government is an absolute necessity. It also will be necessary to raise significant new revenue. Both goals are within our capacity.
\
The presidential campaign should be the forum for a discussion of the appropriate role for government in a modern industrial democracy. The Los Angeles riots have shown that the government must be more active in dealing with our social problems such as health care, public education, drugs and public safety. The government also must stimulate the economy to finance social services and eliminate our deficit.
\
Our first priority should be rebuilding America. A vast national public-investment program should be started, to meet the needs of the country and to provide a long-term countercyclical effect to the weak economy. The most competitive economies in the world today are backed by the highest levels of infrastructure investment. Schools and airports, roads and bridges and many other public facilities must be built to support the private-sector economy, protect the environment and provide a civilized life to urban and suburban Americans.
\
The federal government should commit to providing at least $500 billion over the next 10 years to supplement existing state- and local-government efforts to rebuild America by investing in infrastructure. This should include public-private partnerships for new airports, new air-traffic-control systems, rapid rail links and so on, as well as more traditional public investments in roads, bridges, new schools, mass transit and other basic requirements.
\
Financing such a program, which would amount to less than 1 percent of the decade's gross national product, should be feasible. For instance, a 5-cent-a-gallon gas tax, increasing over 10 years to 50 cents a gallon, would generate $50 billion a year by 2002. A 5-cent tax would amount to about $50 a year for a motorist driving 20,000 miles. As an added benefit, such a tax would be consistent with efforts to protect the environment, and it would reduce our dependence on Mideast oil.
\
With the backing of this committed revenue, a Public Investment Fund could raise the necessary capital through the sale of investment-rated bonds, which could be acquired by private and public pension funds as well as the public markets over the 10-year period. The assets of these pension funds now amount to about $3 trillion and will double to $6 trillion over the next 10 years. They could easily accommodate at least three-quarters of such a program, with the public markets absorbing the rest.
\
A public-investment program on such a scale would generate significant employment and could absorb many of the skilled people who will be laid off as a result of defense cutbacks. Study after study has shown that every dollar of public investment generates about 50 cents of additional private investment. Thus, $500 billion of public investment would generate another $250 billion of private investment.
\
Public-works construction can deal with the physical decay of the cities. Decent schools, decent housing, safe streets and safe public transport all would contribute to a different social climate. In addition, an organized effort should be part of such a program to provide employment to inner-city youngsters age 16 to 22. This could be done through some version of the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, whereby youngsters would be first trained and then employed in the reconstruction of their own cities. Large public-works programs would create real jobs instead of public-service jobs.
\
At the same time, market-related efforts such as Housing Secretary Jack Kemp's proposal for enterprise zones, which would give tax breaks to investment in depressed areas, and private ownership of housing instead of subsidized government projects, also should be part of the mix.
\
For once, let us try to agree on something. It is time to get started.

182,"People with mental\disabilities should not\be moved from happy home\Anyone who encounters panhandlers, as I do almost every day, is reminded of the debacle in the 1970s when residential facilities for those with mental disabilities were closed so that the residents could live ""in the community."" Of course community resources proved inadequate, and many of those discharged came (or are coming) to sad ends while trying to live outside of a supervised setting.\It is surprising and disappointing to learn that Emmaus Homes Inc. of St. Charles is now proposing to follow a similar path. Families with members in the Marthasville facility run by Emmaus are stunned and disappointed to learn that a campus facility which has been a happy home for family members for decades is to be closed.\Scattered housing, even if it can be found, will lack the ready availability of supportive services and cause confusion for longtime residents. While there must be some theories behind this proposed change, such as the dream of a supportive and engaged community that moved planners in the 1970s, one is prompted to suggest that ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it"" should be the guiding principle for Emmaus, lest the unanticipated consequences of the 1970s experiment be repeated.\Matthew P. McCauley * University City\Can't blame Civil War history\for today's situation\I am a 90-plus years old white female. I have Southern ancestry in my family. My immediate ancestors came to Missouri before the Civil War. I never owned a slave, and none of my ancestors born in the last 150 years owned a slave. No person should be owned by another person.\One of my great-great-grandfathers was taken from his home (unarmed) and marched 40 miles and murdered by Union soldiers. He was not a soldier. He was a Missouri state senator. Another of my great-great-grandfathers was a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in south Missouri and north Arkansas. He lost! I believe that is pretty much an established fact!\So, why are we still blaming this disastrous but important time in our history for today's situation? You may remove all the flags, statues and memorials to that particular time in American history, and I will still honor and respect my Southern ancestry.\Jean Tobey * Florissant\Better get rid of\many other flags, too\Ever since the shootings at a church in South Carolina, every one is jumping on the bandwagon wanting to abolish the Confederate flag. They say it represents violence and hate.\With that way of thinking, we must abolish the American flag also. It was ships from New England (the Northern states) traveling under the American flag that brought the Africans to America to be sold as slaves.\It was under the American flag that treaties were signed with the natives that were here before the white people. These treaties gave them permission to live on lands that they already owned. When the white man decided he wanted the land, they would send soldiers in under the American flag to drive them out.\Sometimes they would wipe out whole villages, men, women and children. Sometimes white people would kill Indians just because they were Indians. My grandmother (a Cherokee) and her family were supposed to get land in Oklahoma because of being Indians. Because being uneducated and not understanding all of the legal process, they were cheated out of it by a white lawyer.\Also, the homosexuals must take down the rainbow flags because it offends all Christians and me. Also, the gang bangers must pull up their pants because seeing their underwear offends all decent people.\Edward J. ""Jack"" Deckerd * Perryville, Mo.\Help poverty-stricken teens\stay away from crime\Regarding ""Feds fill gaps in city prosecution"" (June 29): This article explained how more homicide cases in Missouri are going to federal courts. In addition, it touched on an issue plaguing St. Louis: gang violence.\St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson and Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce offered a solid solution of confronting gang members with their families and the police to stop violence. But the issue needs to be addressed further. Poverty-stricken youth in St. Louis are turning to crime, because they have nowhere else to turn. Something needs to change.\First, struggling schools need funding. The benevolence of affluent families and corporations is needed. Wealthier schools receive donations for turf fields and pools, while others are on the verge of closing and lack the materials they need. That's not fair. Students need safe and productive schools where teachers will encourage them to work hard and rise from the difficult circumstances they've been dealt.\Secondly, children and teens need access to recreational facilities. Communities like Kirkwood, Des Peres, Webster Groves and Clayton should transport underprivileged youth, maybe by a bus running through the city, and offer them discounted lessons and classes. When given something to look forward to away from hostile environments, young people will stop taking to the streets and start looking to the future.\In my humble opinion as an 18-year-old girl from Kirkwood, this is just the beginning of what needs to be done, but I think these ideas can help St. Louis teens eclipse the violence around them.\Rachel Fechter * Kirkwood\Not a peep about\killings in Chicago\Recently the true tragedy in South Carolina taking nine innocent lives was horrendous. It gave the race baiters (Al Sharpton, President Obama, Jesse Jackson, Hillary Clinton and others) opportunity for face time to support their ideological causes.\Then on July 4, 10 blacks are gunned down in Rahm Emanuel's fiefdom of Chicago, and not a peep.

184,"Why the surprise?\I am appalled at the reaction to the John Brennan removal of his security clearance. I don’t understand why the government does not do that anytime a person no longer works for the government. Any private business, once an employee is gone immediately takes away your security credentials. That is the way it should be in the government also.\Smooth out the bumps\I, for one, will not vote for a gas tax increase because MODOT can’t learn how to put a culvert across the road without making a speed bump. Whenever they learn to do that, I will consider voting yes on a gas tax.\Why they left\In response to Dr. Kraus’ statement in the paper, I am a current St. Joseph School District teacher and I would like to respond to it. With the school closures, teachers who were tenured were told they could go anywhere in the district for a position we were qualified for. Then we were told we couldn’t. Then it was stated if we were placed and a position we wanted became available we could move on. Then we couldn’t. Human resources constantly gave us the runaround. This is why many highly qualified teachers left the district and moved outside the district.\Banish balloons\This would be a great opportunity for St. Joseph to be on the vanguard of something new that is taking place — banishing balloons and straws. We can’t be first, but we don’t always have to be last. It would look good on our resume to show that we were interested in our environment and something besides ourselves.\Another view\The left-wing wackos have been wanting to ban plastic straws. Now, according to FOX News, they want to ban balloons because balloons are dangerous to birds. These people are totally insane.\More for less\To the caller that said that the Democrats want socialism, we pay more for health care and we are not in the top 20 as far as birth mortality rate. We pay more for medicine and get less. That is just a fact of life and it has got to be fixed."
185,"Will Missourians see another round of income tax cuts? Will Republican lawmakers succeed in making it more difficult to sue businesses? Will strife between state senators and Gov. Eric Greitens re-emerge to block GOP legislative efforts?\These are some of the questions that will be answered by the Missouri General Assembly's 2018 session, which began Wednesday and runs through mid-May. Lawmakers have returned to Jefferson City to pass a balanced budget for the next fiscal year and to reform, scrap or pass state statutes covering a wide variety of issues.\The state House of Representatives' first day went smoothly. Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, reiterated his goal of improving the state's economic climate and improving opportunities for Missouri's families and children. He added that he expects the House to pass a lobbyist gift ban next week.\House Democratic priorities include restoring whistleblower protections, passing a slew of ethics-reform legislation and pushing legislation to address the negative effects of opioids on Missourians, said Rep. Gail McCann Beatty, the House minority leader.\In the Senate, though Republican leaders say they too want to move forward with conservative legislation that wasn't passed in 2017, the tempo was different.\Less than 30 minutes after the Senate convened, self-described ""wild card"" Sen. Rob Schaaf turned the focus of proceedings to his and other senators' gripes with Greitens. With Sen. Gary Romine, Schaaf pledged to block the governor's appointments to the State Board of Education.\Fresh on the heels of national tax reform, Missouri lawmakers will likely consider a bevy of changes to the state's tax codes. Reducing individual income tax rates, decoupling the state's standard individual income tax deduction from the federal tax code, and collecting sales tax revenue from online transactions are some of the proposed changes in a comprehensive tax bill filed by Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring.\Richardson, the House speaker, said he expected ""a manageable hit"" from the federal tax reform bill and didn't see a need to decouple Missouri tax code from the U.S. code.\Beatty, the House minority leader, noted that ""any hit to our budget is a challenge.""\Sen. Ron Richard, the top Republican in the Senate, cautioned against slashing taxes too much.\""We already cut higher education to the bone or less than the bone, and that really bothers me,"" said Richard, R-Joplin.\On the topic of tax reform, Sen. Gina Walsh, the top Democratic senator, said, ""we have got to find a way to pay for things in this state.""\""It's nice to tell people we're gonna reduce their taxes, but you have to tell them you're going to reduce their services at the same time,"" said Walsh, D-St. Louis County.\Raising Missouri's motor fuel tax rate — untouched since being set at 17 cents per gallon in 1996 — is also on the table as a means to create more revenue for maintaining highways, roads and bridges. Eigel's bill would raise the gas tax to 23 cents; a legislative tax force recently recommended raising it to 27 cents to keep up with inflation.\One component of the bill would allow Missouri to tax online transactions, which proponents say levels the playing field for competition between online sellers and physical retailers. Rep. Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, has filed similar legislation and has said that collecting sales taxes on e-commerce could raise up to $210 million.\Another part of Eigel's tax plan aligns with Greitens' aims to reform incentives by capping tax credits at $425 million annually. Tax credit redemptions have grown by 20 percent over the past decade, according to Auditor Nicole Galloway's office.\The Republican governor and his allies on the Missouri Housing Development Commission already have acted along these lines outside the legislative process by voting not to issue state low-income housing tax credits. This move, which Greitens touted as a fiscally responsible reform of an inefficient program, was decried by Ozarks residents who attended a November public hearing in Springfield.\Eigel's proposal is a ""calculated, thoughtful, comprehensive bill,"" said Rep. Travis Fitzwater, R-Holts Summit, who is sponsoring the legislation in the House.\""If you're an infrastructure wonk, you have your gas tax increase. If you want tax credit reform, you've got that, so the governor's office is thrilled with that discussion,"" Fitzwater said at a mid-December press conference. ""You've got folks (in the legislature), they want a fair and balanced environment for local retailers. ... We're doing a lot of things that in and of themselves, they can't get done.""\It takes only one senator to grind the chamber to a halt, and Romine, R-Farmington, had previously told the News-Leader that he would filibuster Greitens' appointments to the state Board of Education.\Schaaf, a frequent critic and occasional target of the governor, added that he, too, planned to block Greitens' appointments from being confirmed.\Five members picked by Greitens sat on the board after a carousel of appointments, withdrawals and resignations, and these five voted to fire Margie Vandeven, the former commissioner of education.\As interim appointees, they would need to be confirmed by the Senate within a month. If not confirmed by then, they would be barred from serving, and Romine's staunch opposition made that a likely proposition.\Greitens tried to buy more time for the five Wednesday, when he issued a statement to say he was withdrawing their names and reappointing them.\""We're here to help teachers, students, and families succeed. We found a great group of leaders in our state to work with us,"" Greitens said in the statement.\By doing so, Greitens could preserve his picks from being barred after 30 days. However, his appointees now have to be confirmed by the Senate before they can serve.\Now lacking a quorum, the board of education cannot vote for the time being.\The board has multiple meetings on tap for next week, and the Senate Committee on Gubernatorial Appointments is scheduled to meet Thursday morning.\Richard, the Senate president pro tem and chair of the appointments committee, indicated that the board of education appointees might not get a hearing at all and said the board situation ""could have been handled better.""\""I'm going to protect the Senate at all costs,"" Richard added.\The months of board turmoil now overlap with the search for a new education commissioner. The Kansas City Star reported Tuesday that only one person has applied for the job. Less than a week remains before the application window is slated to close.\Last May, Greitens chastised lawmakers for not doing enough, hinted at the two special sessions he would eventually call and characterized the 2017 session as ""the first round of a 10-round fight.""\A spokesman for Greitens said the governor did not plan to hold a press conference or issue a statement in conjunction with the start of 2018 session.\CAPTION: \House Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, outlines his legislative goals on the Missouri General Assembly's first day of the 2018 session on Wednesday.\Tim Bommel/Missouri House of Representatives"
186,"YOUR VIEWS OPINION\ A day for remembrance, not for politics\ The Bush administration again has done a disservice to veterans. On Veterans Day, a hallowed day, administration officials talk of politics, not of remembrance and honor to our veterans. This administration again has taken advantage of and used our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines to make a political point.\ Veterans Day is a day to talk about sacrifice, service, dedication and honor. It is a day to remember those who gave their all and to honor their memories. This is a day to recognize those who served honorably, whether is was one day on the beaches at Normandy, one month in the frozen war zone of Korea, one tour in the jungles of Vietnam or a career of 20 years spanning several campaigns.\ Veterans Day and Memorial Day are not for politics. This administration owes an apology to the veterans of this great country.\ Dennis W. Smith | Farmington, Mo.\ Gouged at the pump\ Sorry, but the Post-Dispatch got it wrong again in ""Boiled in oil"" (Nov. 11). It isn't the oil execs who ""cash in,"" but state and federal governments that cash in regardless of the price of gasoline. The average gasoline tax is 42 cents per gallon, and that's whether gas is selling for $1.50 or $3 per gallon.\ The chart from U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., showing oil executives' pay was demagoguery of the basest kind. If all five of the oil executives were to work for free, it wouldn't drop the price of gas one cent per gallon. Ms. Boxer knows that, and so does the Post-Dispatch. She at least had the excuse of showboating for her liberal base. What was the Post-Dispatch's excuse?\ Bill Huggins | St. Clair\ Earth and human nature\ In ""Thank God for $3.50 gasoline"" (Nov. 13), columnist Charles Krauthammer gives us a lesson in economics and implies that higher prices for gasoline plus a gas tax will make the consumer conserve. He says the consumer is not stupid. By implementing a gas tax we could solve our budget deficits and save social security, he says. He also suggests that we drill for more oil, build new oil refineries, abolish emissions regulations and let the market decide. What market is he talking about -- the consumer market or the oil and automobile market? The consumer market had its shot in the 1970s and went back to gas-guzzlers and higher oil consumption.\ The oil companies and the automobile companies are in a death- lock and the fate of the world hangs in balance. The consumers are not smart.\ The oil noose about which Mr. Krauthammer writes is wrapped around our global neck and is cutting off our supply of clean air. Earth will become a Mars wanna-be. Mr. Krauthammer needs a lesson in earth science and human nature.\ Robert Messick | Wood River\ Simply created\ The human race has intellectually evolved over written history with one enduring God-given genetic quality: to disagree -- politics, religion, morality, birth control, environment, technology, medical research. Just name it.\ Why not take another rational step forward in the debate between science and intelligent design? Join hands and try to get along without all the sound and fury. Keep it simple: God created evolution.\ P.R. Kosmal | Ferguson\ Pardon moi?\ Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and other Democrats publicly challenged President George W. Bush to rule out a pardon for vice presidential adviser I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby. Could there be a more obvious political ploy? Mr. Libby hasn't been convicted of anything and, therefore, has nothing for which he can be pardoned.\ Mr. Reid also said Vice President Dick Cheney had been involved in the ""manipulation of intelligence to sell the war in Iraq"" as well as in ""leaking classified information to discredit White House critics."" We can only marvel at Mr. Reid's super-human investigative powers since he, apparently alone, has the evidence to support such charges.\ Al Dorn | O'Fallon, Ill.\ Already late\ Concerning the proposed work on Highway 40/Interstate 64 between Interstate 270 and Kingshighway: I think St. Louis and Missouri would be better served if the project did not happen and the money were spent on other projects.\ From what I have seen, there will be one lane added in each direction and it will take three to four years to accomplish. This project is too little and too late. One lane added 10 years ago might have been OK. Now, three lanes would need to be added to justify the disruption for three to four years for construction.\ Instead of spending the money on Highway 40, we should put money into projects that are not already too late: building roads where they are needed. For example, the Page Avenue extension is a great road, but it should have been started in 1980, not 1995. Building the right road at the right time is less costly, less disruptive and assists growth. Building them late is more costly, more disruptive and doesn't assist growth. Building late is just wasteful.\ Rich Seibel | Chesterfield\ One-way traffic\ With all the discussion about how to improve Highway 40 with a minimum of disruption, no one has suggested construction on one direction at a time. For example, while the eastbound lanes are under construction, the westbound lanes could function as reversible lanes.\ Sure, this would be confusing at first, but over the time it will take to complete the work, drivers will become accustomed to it. Additional work may be required at some on- and off-ramps and some may be temporarily closed, but even this would be preferable to a shutdown.\ John P. Schroeder | Wildwood\ Deciding on evidence\ The story ""Darwin loses Kansas battle"" (Nov. 9) said that the decision in Kansas to allow the teaching of ""intelligent design"" in the classroom ""changes the definition of science."" That's absurd. The word ""science"" comes from the Latin ""scientia,"" which means ""to know."" The goal of the intelligent design movement is to know the truth.\ Also, the goal of intelligent design is not to try to impress a ""non-natural"" answer to the universe. The only reasonable philosophical argument is that this universe must have had a beginning. This theory can be strongly defended by the laws of science, including thermodynamics and Einstein's theory of relativity. Many highly acclaimed scientists and philosophers throughout history subscribed to the idea of an ""un-caused first cause"" as a necessary ingredient to the existence of all that we know, even without the striking evidence presented by cosmologists and statisticians today.\ For too long the intelligent design movement has been ignored and criticized as unintellectual, which it surely is not. Objective thinkers should hear the argument before criticizing its place in the classroom.\ Remember, the intelligent design theory is not formulated to boot evolution from the classroom. It should be given equal footing so it can be heard and critiqued by students. The students can decide, from the evidence, which is more likely to have occurred.\ Ian Hegger | Florissant\ Fears\ Biological weapons in Iraq. Weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Iran and North Korea. Global warming. Polar melting. Climate shift. Hurricane Rita. Hurricane Wilma. A bomb in a New York City subway. A bomb on a Boston highway.

Christopher ""Kit"" Bond, R-Mo., was one of only nine people in the Senate to support the White House effort to allow the CIA the option to torture prisoners. Mr. Bond also voted to disallow the protection of habeas corpus for captives.\ U.S. Sen. Jim Talent, R-Mo., didn't vote for the amendment allowing the torture of prisoners, but he did vote to remove habeas corpus protection.\ These are very important votes. They show the clear direction the Republican government wants to move. These votes are contrary to the laws and spirit of the United States of America.\ Richard Quick | Valley Park\ Evil mindset\ People continue to refer to CIA-sponsored torture camps.

187,"Family farmers respect their accountability to future generations\""A new face on farming"" (Nov. 12) failed to distinguish between family farm corporations and giant agribusiness. Large family farms, incorporated to preserve multigenerational assets, have a heritage from previous generations and accountability and responsibility to the next. Agri-giants are accountable only to stockholders on a quarterly basis. The two are not the same.\A corporate five-year plan has little in common with Grandpa, his son or daughter and grandkids walking the family's acreage, touching the soil and knowing the watershed of the land. Consider the care for lab security and the pampering of plant materials taken by the bio-biz corporations over and against their disregard for soil and water conservation on mega-farms. \Consumers are not upset by the operation of big family farms, be they owned by women, men or family corporations. We object to secretive genetic manipulations, perpetual control of crop seed and the chemical and mechanical despoiling of the land that results in produce with long shelf lives and little or no taste.\If women farm owners are being advanced in a public relations gambit to put a ""good face"" on agribusiness, there's a danger they might become its shills. That would be one more sign that public relations mean more to these women's sponsors than does the production of wholesome food and stewardship of the land. Let's not confuse the two kinds of corporations here, nor the motives of consumers, in the test states or nationally. What we seek is simply a healthy quality of life in the food on our family table.\Richard Wagner - Highland\Don't resent the rich\Liberal politicians still are advancing the idea that a tax increase on the ""rich"" is in order. It seems as if they want to gain control of more private-sector resources to support their political agenda.\The left needs to learn that the rich don't sleep on mattresses filled with money. They either invest their money or they spend it. \A rich person can buy a yacht, while I can only afford a rowboat. But the people who build, sell and maintain yachts aren't rich. For them a yacht represents jobs. And they pay taxes. The yacht company makes a profit and pays taxes. I don't resent rich people, although the left tries hard to foster such resentment.\When a rich person invests his money, he hopes to make a profit. Often, the rich are willing to take substantial risks to start or grow a business. Poor people can't afford to take such risks. But no investor, large or small, wants to risk money in a climate of uncertainty regarding taxes, regulations, fiscal policies and health care mandates. This is why the recovery is lagging and why investors are sitting on the sidelines, making only low-risk investments that generate no jobs.\It seems like the left is again resorting to class warfare. I see no point in taking money out of the pockets of the ""rich"" and giving it to politicians who have an abysmal record in using it effectively.\Duane Crofts - Creve Coeur\Washington insanity\Parts of the president's deficit commission's suggestions for reducing this country's deficit are just more Washington insanity, especially a proposed 15-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax. \This suggestion should get everyone's attention. Gasoline consumption can be reduced - two people who traveled separately may carpool, we may consolidate shopping trips. The result is less gasoline purchased and lower tax collection. Consumer behavior will trump Washington's thought process.\Also, federal guidelines mandate higher mileage for autos. The 2010 fleet mileage requirements is 27; by 2016, it will be 35. That will result in less gasoline purchased. Electric vehicles will erode further the revenue from a gas tax. Washington, are you listening?\According to the Energy Information Administration, gasoline consumption peaked at 142 billion gallons in 2007; in 2009, it was down to 137 billion gallons. As far back as 2002, the consumption level was 135 billion. The consumption levels in 2007 and 2009 would have produced extra revenue of $2.135 billion and $2.066 billion at 15 cents per gallon.\Economists have estimated that for every 1-cent increase in the price of gasoline, $1 billion in spending drains from the economy because of the multiplier effect. A family goes out to dinner and tips the server. The server goes to the hair salon. And the hair stylist buys concert tickets, and on and on. With an increased gas tax, there would be less spending, less of a multiplier effect and less than a dent in the deficit. \Do we want collect $2 billion in gas taxes while giving up multiple billions in consumer spending?\Steve Theby - St. Charles\Nuclear now\The administration and the Republicans have been at a standstill for months on an energy bill, yet this is one of the most important issues for both our environment and economy. \The one bright spot with regard to bipartisanship are their positions on nuclear energy. Both the White House and Republicans are convinced that the United States needs to move strongly to build the next generation of nuclear plants to meet the demand for electricity, avoid pollution and positively affect climate change.\Yet without an energy bill, or at least pieces of an energy bill, that provides the necessary loan guarantees for the first handful of new-design plants, not much is going to happen. Republicans agree that restarting a critical U.S. industry that has not built a new-design plant since the 1970s is the right place for government intervention. \Who knows, an agreement on new nuclear construction might open the door for Washington to become productive on other issues. \William B. Briggs - Town and Country\Buying their way in\Linda McMahon spent $50 million of her own money on her campaign for the U.S. Senate. Meg Whitman spent $160 million of her own money on her campaign for governor of California. Carly Fiorina spent $6 million of her own money on her campaign for the U.S. Senate.\Carl Paladino spent $10 million of his own money on his campaign for governor of New York. Michael Bloomberg, in a previous election, spent $109 million to get himself elected as mayor of New York.\That's $335 million from the pockets of five people. That's money that these fine people have chosen not to give to the starving, not to give to the homeless, not to give to find cures for diseases, not to give to education, blah, blah, blah. \But they have no trouble spending that money on themselves to try to be elected to prestigious jobs. This is immoral. I can't be the only who thinks our Creator is not pleased with what they choose to do with their enormous wealth.\Phil Kuhlman - St. Peters\Not of the mold\The editorial ""E pluribus multi"" (Nov. 7) was right on target. I, too, have wondered what politicians mean when they say ""the American people."" They can't speak for all of us, yet they pretend to. They believe we are one giant mass of clay, willing to be molded into whatever they wish to be. We are too diverse for that. I've also wondered about that fictitious map of red and blue states that shows up after each election. I can't be included as a Republican within a red state. I am not and never have been a Republican. I don't fit that mold.\All politicians should stop using ""the American people"" as a tool for their convenience. Many can't unite the country; instead, they forever yell, with their followers, ""Get the government off of our backs and out of our lives."" Yet, the preamble to our Constitution makes it clear that it is very much in the center of our lives. And we, ""the people,"" who have studied that document are aware of and appreciate it.\Mildred T. Kirk - Berkeley"
188,"Road tax\Taxpayers are paying for trucks\Elizabeth R. Roberts\Springfield\We the people are tired of subsidizing the trucking industry.\It is not the lightweight vehicles that are tearing up our roads and bridges. It is the heavyweight trucks.\They say our fuel-efficient cars are not bringing in enough tax revenue to fix the roads, but our cars are not the ones doing the damage.\They say that asphalt, concrete and steel prices have doubled since the last time the gas tax was increased, but they have continued to widen the highways that we now have to maintain.\Thirty-seven percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings to retire on. We are living in different times and a different world. We simply cannot waste what little we have for larger highways and trucking routes.\Other countries are way ahead of us with trains and other mass transit, which are more energy efficient. The Missouri Department of Transportation should consider trains or other methods of travel, rather than just building more roads and bridges for us to maintain for the trucking industry.\Even if you support additional funding for MoDOT, the revenue should come from those who use the roads most. A general sales tax costs us all money and disproportionally benefits trucking.\A toll road system or a gas tax increase would at least make the people using the roads pay for them.\Making the rest of us pay for their costs just is not right.\Tell your representative that you will vote ""No"" on any sales tax for MoDOT.\Common Core\Bills point out local control\June Stetson\Lampe\In February, Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Jeff Duncan introduced in the Senate and the House, respectively, resolutions that proclaim education is a state, local and parental issue.\Their resolutions, sponsored by nine additional senators, with 52 co-sponsors in the House, denounce Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and President Barack Obama for using $4.3 billion in stimulus Race to the Top grants and No Child Left Behind waivers as bribes to coerce states into adopting Common Core standards.\Regions letter\Minimum wage claims not facts\Mike O'Shea\Branson\The one thing John Regions and I apparently have in common is that neither one of us has a clue concerning what facts explain his opposition to raising the minimum wage (""No benefit to raising wage,"" April 17).\According to the U.S. Department of Labor, at any given moment, less than 5 percent of hourly workers are making minimum wage. If you add salaried and contract workers, it's about 3 percent. So, I'll bet less than $3 an hour for the few lowest paid Americans will allow business much the same ""control (over) their destiny, in surviving the market.""\However, I seriously question that those making minimum wage are or will be in a ""benefit-rich work environment,"" or that such jobs give employees any significant ""discretionary income"" for business to rely on.\As for investors, we aren't talking about ""substantially higher employee wage costs."" We are just bringing a small percentage of the lowest paid workers up to earning enough to support their families -- if they remain frugal.\As for Regions' ""questions relative to potentialities"" (My sources are the U.S. Department of Labor, Missouri Department of Economic Development, Bureau of Business and Economic Research and Forbes magazine):\First, going back to 1938, there is no evidence of any correlation between factory production and the minimum wage. As for ""over-regulation has already done much to reduce profitability in manufacturing,"" sorry, I'm from Missouri -- show me. I really looked, but found no statistics that supported that premise in any way.\Second, there isn't going to be any extra family income to go -- anywhere. We're not talking about families going from $25,000 to $40,000 even; we are talking about going from less than $15,000 to around $20,000, and the family will still be low-income.\Third, while 15 of the 25 highest cost of living states do already have minimum wages above the $7.25 national minimum, 19 of those same 25 states are also among the top 25 in per capita income.\Regions' facts (or lack thereof) don't add up. His ""belief"" is not ""proof enough in testing for an outcome.""\Frazier Glenn Miller\NAACP still has much work to do\Cheryl Clay\Springfield\Occasionally, I am greeted with a bit of surprise that the NAACP is still needed in today's contemporary society. I usually smile and simply say, ""There is still much to be done!""\The recent tragedy in Overland Park, Kan., and the suspected killer's ties to the Ozarks have shown us that the work of the NAACP in eliminating hatred and discrimination is far from over. We are shocked by this most recent example of hatred and bigotry and offer our deepest sympathy to all of those impacted.\As an advocacy organization, we are committed to awareness, education and programming to lend dignity and respect for everyone. When we learn that specific organizations are targeted, such as the ones in Overland Park, it points to the continued targets that many groups and individuals in our society become because of their race, ethnicity, religion, gender or sexual orientation.\We receive many reports of alleged discrimination incidents on a regular basis and seek to address those in the appropriate manner and always with a goal of resolution.\Media reports over the past week of an elected official expressing agreement with some of the hateful philosophy of the alleged killer added to the need for community awareness and action. It is hard to put into words the impact this has when such outright bigotry is so openly expressed. Efforts by some residents to oppose those statements are important to let our larger community know that we want to be a welcoming community and area.\The NAACP encourages community dialogue and all sectors of our area working together to stand against all forms of hatred and bigotry.\While there is still much work to be done, we are working every day on it.\Political cartoon\Blacks not part\of the equation\Arthur Hodge\Springfield\I, as a black man in America, take exception to the cartoon in the News-Leader on April 21.\Those in power and those who own and run media outlets of European descent feel it is OK to make light of blacks, who have worked twice as hard, twice as long to just get in the door. Once there, they are denigrated, ostracized, castigated, belittled, called all manner of names, treated less than a common thief.\They went through hell for just being black in this country, and the News-Leader makes light of the trials, tribulations and verbal abuse of Hank Aaron and many other blacks in America.\Right here in Springfield, blacks are invisible. No one ever asks us what we think or how we feel about an issue.\We have feelings, can think, and we need to be part of the equation in society.\But those in power want to make all the decisions and see what black they can poke fun at the next time around.\It is a travesty, in this day and age, that this country has not matured enough in the realm of seeing each individual as a person and get over the color line.\Unless you are black in America, you have no idea what it is to be black in America. There are some good people who see blacks as human beings, but not enough.\We cannot continue making light of others' plight in America and around the world. We must become one America, for the sake of America.\As a veteran, I know that if we don't we will all perish because of the word ""hate."" We have lots of talking heads using deception, spreading their venom around the city, state and the country.\Peace."
189,"Cahokia airport improvements are St. Louis' own 'Bridge to Nowhere'\Regarding ""Improved runway, lights boost Downtown Airport"" (Nov. 25): Taxpayers are getting bilked out of an additional $7 million for a local version of the ""Bridge to Nowhere.""\U.S. Rep. Jerry Costello, D-Belleville, proudly announced that he had obtained a ""grant"" to lengthen and strengthen runways at St. Louis Downtown Airport to land large commercial jets. Mr. Costello, like the rest of the Washington, D.C., crowd, just does not get it. That was my money that was wasted for a bigger and thicker slice of concrete. \That ""grant"" did not appear out of the vapors. Those $7 million dollars belong to you and me. It is our money paid in the form of income tax and fees added every time we use a commercial airplane. We are building runways and airports no different from the famed ""Bridge to Nowhere"" that U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, proposed to link two sparsely populated islands in the Alaskan hinterlands.\Closer to home, and much closer to the new $7 million runway, MidAmerica Airport's terminal sits empty. The lights are out and no one is home. The massive infrastructure rarely is used, except by Scott Air Force Base and a very rare charter flight. No scheduled flights use MidAmerica - not one! \The decades-long fight to uproot hundreds of North County residents and build a billion-dollar runway at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport was won. The homes were demolished and the runway was built. \That billion-dollar investment can't be used as planned because bureaucrats will not force American Airlines to tear down a maintenance building built decades ago by Ozark Airlines. The multi-million dollar ""D"" concourse that connects two under-utilized terminals is walled off.\We soon will have three airports that can land large aircraft. One is closed, one never will see commercial service and one is a shadow of its former glory. Politicians and bureaucrats just don't get it. I hope citizens recognize that their tax dollars are being thrown into the sewer.\I am tired and disgusted. I plan to vote against every incumbent I can - local, state and national. The politicians did not get the word the last election, Republicans and Democrats alike are feeding at the trough of tax dollars. It is time for a massive nationwide pig roast.\Stuart M. Katz - Chesterfield\St. Louis veterans deserve answers\Regarding Bill McClellan's column ""Citizenship suddenly matters in VA post"" (Nov. 20): It appears that politics at its worst may be at work in filling an important medical position, director of the Veterans Affairs Spinal Cord Injury Service, with an unqualified individual and possibly compromising the care of veterans with spinal cord injury. Certainly, veterans deserve to be treated by qualified specialists.\I hope that Mr. McClellan's column caught the eye of elected officials who can make a difference in a situation like this and make things right if it is determined that errors in hiring were made. I also encourage the Post-Dispatch to look into this matter further. Dr. Florian Thomas, a non-U.S. citizen but a permanent U.S. resident, has been on the medical staff with the VA since 1995 and has been director of the VA Spinal Cord Injury Service since 2004. VA provisions then and now allow for a non-U.S. citizen, such as Dr. Thomas, to hold a physician position and/or be a director of a medical specialty service. He is board-certified in Neurology and Spinal Cord Injury Medicine and a well-known expert on multiple sclerosis. His contributions have been recognized by a congressional proclamation, and he was a recipient of an award from the Gateway Chapter of the National MS Society. \If, as the column suggests, there are specific VA qualifications to be director of a Spinal Cord Injury Service, then veterans deserve to know that the St. Louis VA hires doctors who meet the required higher standard than having graduated from a medical school, being licensed as a doctor and having done an internship. If the director of a Spinal Cord Injury Service must have trained in spinal cord injury medicine, a determination should be made if the VA hiring guidelines for the director were met in choosing Dr. Thomas' successor. \Mr. McClellan reported that the VA-appointed interview panel recommended not hiring either of the two applicants who were U.S. citizens. Veterans have a right to know why the St. Louis VA director overruled this recommendation and ignored official requirements for a director of a Spinal Cord Injury Service.\Albert C. Stutsman Jr. - St. Louis Vietnam Veteran, U.S. Marine Corps\Do-nothing Legislature mirrors U.S. Congress\For six months every year, Jefferson City buzzes with activity as the legislators claim to do the bidding of their constituents and safeguard their interests while creating an environment that makes Missouri a good place to work, live and raise a family. In theory, this sounds good, but in practice another reality takes shape.\Lawmakers bring their biases, ideologies and world views to the table and a contentious political tug of war is waged between rural and urban, moderate and conservative, Democrat and Republican. Add in the machinations of lobbyists, and the resulting brew no longer serves the public so much as it serves special interests.\As the dust settles from the special session of the Missouri Legislature, Jefferson City is starting to look a lot like Washington, D.C., in that both have become places where nothing is accomplished on behalf of the American people. Congress has come to a grinding halt and is unable to address the socioeconomic crises that are choking the nation.\In the special session, lawmakers failed to transfer the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department from state oversight to local control after it was placed on the agenda by Gov. Jay Nixon but held hostage until the passage of funding for the China cargo hub at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. The Legislature missed a huge opportunity to move the St. Louis police into the 21st century by placing St. Louis on par with municipalities statewide that control their police forces. Republicans in Congress ignored job creation by rejecting financial help for cities to retain or hire more police officers, firefighters and teachers. While touting itself as a law-and-order party, the GOP turned its back on first responders.\As state legislatures across the country grapple with ideological battles over economic inequality, workers' rights, reproductive rights, voting rights, freedom to marry, civil liberties, public safety and immigration fairness, the people they claim to represent have no recourse but to voice their frustration through mass action like the Occupy movement.\Housing foreclosures, nagging unemployment and rising poverty are reaching epidemic levels. Missouri lawmakers mirror their congressional counterparts in allowing politics and ideology to trump the disastrous conditions that leave Missouri families tottering on the edge of ruin. These politicians continue to ignore the public at their own peril. The day of reckoning will soon come when they will have to answer for their inaction. That day is Nov. 6, 2012.\Jamala Rogers - St. Louis\Zaki Baruti - St. Louis Co-chairpersons, Coalition Against Police Crimes and Repression\Don't expand or toll Interstate 70\My house overlooks Interstate 70. Missouri does not need I-70 to become a six-lane toll road beyond the St. Louis and Kansas City areas. I-70 is a free highway system form the Ohio-Pennsylvania state line to Utah. The Penn Turnpike predates the interstate system. \Most highways used by Missourians in every direction are free, except for Oklahoma, where the old Route 66 costs $9 maximum from the Missouri state line into and around Oklahoma City. Why should Missouri charge tolls when Missourians can travel in other states without tolls but may have higher gas taxes?\To create six lanes would be terribly destructive to the cities through which it passes and destroy a huge number of businesses. Further, it would attract even more truck traffic.\To make it a toll road would be a heavy burden on the populations of the rural counties through which it passes, as well as the thousands of students who attend schools along the route. \The Missouri Department of Transportation should continue the transformation of other routes to four-lanes for both economic and safety reasons.\MoDOT should encourage truck traffic to take advantage of Highway 36, which could be changed into an extension of Interstate 72.\Missouri and the federal government should raise the gas tax. Equipment, supplies and salaries all cost much more, and better vehicle mileage cuts tax revenue. The tax is needed to maintain both rural and urban roads and bridges. A general sales tax would be unfair. A gas tax is the fairest tax. It's no wonder Illinois drivers cross the Mississippi River to buy gasoline in Missouri. Missouri tries to get by on the cheap.\Why is the state considering making only I-70 a toll road? Why not all interstates or all four-lane divided highways in the state? Why not urban roads like Lindbergh Boulevard?\We need to stop worshipping highways and get beyond the arrogance of an engineer who once bragged to me that in Missouri, highways go through homes, churches, businesses, cemeteries, farms and anything else that would get in their way.\Edward C. Wicklein - O'Fallon, Mo.\Canoeing the River Styx\Regarding ""Bells toll for 1-70"" (Nov. 18) and recent letters: Traveling Interstate 70 is nothing less than canoeing around Hades' River Styx!\Are we so blind and mule-headed that we won't tackle the festering problem, which could be corrected by adding more lanes and a toll?\Ultimately, we'll simply be washed upon the shores of Hades by the 18-wheelers that now rule the interstate.\Intelligence demands that we must move forward; the status quo of I-70 is our death warrant.\Joan C. Kretschmer - Clayton\Trying to undermine women's health\Conservative Republicans and Catholic bishops are mounting a relentless attack on a recent decision by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to require new insurance plans to cover birth control with no copays. \These opponents are pushing to undermine this preventive care provision to allow Catholic hospitals and universities to be exempted, even though these organizations employ and serve individuals of different faiths and backgrounds. If the president bows to this pressure, it would mean millions of workers and their families would lose access to affordable birth control. \The reality is that women of all faiths - yes, even Catholics - use birth control and would benefit from access to birth control without copays: 99 percent of sexually experienced women in the United States use birth control at some point in their lives, including 98 percent of sexually experienced Catholic women. For most women in America, birth control is an essential part of our preventive health care. \This is another area where conservative Republicans and Catholic bishops are out of step with the reality of people's lives. These strong-armed attacks are not consistent with current practice in which most existing health plans already cover contraceptive services, and in which the majority of states, including Missouri, have enacted laws requiring contraceptive equity in approved insurance plans.\Contraceptive coverage without copays is one of the most popular benefits of the new health care reform law because it makes sense. By making birth control affordable, we will improve women's health, give women greater control of their future, strengthen families, prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce the need for abortion. \We call on the president to stand strong and to fight off these attacks on the most basic health care for women. \Paula Gianino - St. Louis President and CEO, Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri"
190," The House will likely go along if the Senate votes to suspend the 18-cent federal gas tax, but a new way would have to be found to pay for highway construction, the House majority leader says.\ At any rate, Rep. Dick Armey said, suspending the tax would be a temporary fix to a permanent problem of high gasoline prices. More helpful would be to augment the natural gas delivery system, deal more forcefully with foreign oil suppliers and cut down on oil imports, he said on ""Fox News Sunday.""\ Armey, a Republican, represents the northern Dallas-Fort Worth area.\ On the gasoline tax, most of which is supposed to go into a highway trust fund, Armey said a source of replacement money would be an important consideration before the tax could be suspended. Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., who controls the flow of legislation in the Senate as majority leader, has said he may have a vote on a suspension suggested by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.\ ""I think the House is willing to do that, but ... we want to do it correctly,"" Armey said. ""And the first thing you have to answer is, 'How do you replenish the highway construction funds?'\ ""And if we can work out that riddle, I think we'll be able to do that. It will be a good thing to do.""\ Like other Republicans in this election year, Armey largely blamed President Bill Clinton's administration for high gasoline prices. Should Vice President Al Gore become president instead of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, he said, gas prices would climb inexorably higher.\ ""That is his policy for the environment, to eliminate the internal combustion engine,"" Armey said.\ In April's reissue of Gore's 1992 book ""Earth in the Balance,"" the vice president wrote a foreword in which he reaffirmed his idea that such engines should be eliminated within 25 years. He said he doesn't want to eliminate the car, just to develop a car that won't harm the environment.\ On ABC's ""This Week,"" Wisconsin's Republican governor, Tommy Thompson, was asked his view of what is causing the current price levels, more than $2 a gallon in much of his state.\ ""First,"" Thompson said, ""I don't think the Clinton-Gore administration has any idea what a good energy policy is. Second, we're so dependent on OPEC nations for importing our oil.""\ He added into the mix new Environmental Protection Agency rules for less-polluting fuel and the country's dwindling refining and delivery infrastructure.\ In response, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said, ""You never once heard him suggest the possibility - even the possibility - that the oil companies might have been gouging us. ... They don't want to put the blame where it should lie, and that's with the oil companies.""\ Durbin said the Federal Trade Commission is issuing subpoenas to major oil companies in its investigation of their activities."
191,"\\WASHINGTON | House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday pledged swift work by Congress on a job and infrastructure package that will be “fiscally sound,” but said she isn’t sure whether the next major item on President Joe Biden’s agenda will attract Republican backing.\Fresh off a major legislative victory on the $1.9 trillion virus relief package that passed on near-party lines, Democrats face long and tough battles ahead in winning GOP endorsement of the administration’s plans.\Road- and bridge-building legislation has a long history of support from both parties as lawmakers aim to deliver on projects back home. But Republicans disagree with Biden’s focus on the environment and the possibility of financing any program with debt after the government borrowed heavily to address the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.\“Building roads and bridges and water supply systems and the rest has always been bipartisan, always been bipartisan, except when they oppose it with a Democratic president, as they did under President Obama, and we had to shrink the package,” said Pelosi, D-Calif.\“But, nonetheless, hopefully, we will have bipartisanship,” she said.\Pelosi has directed key Democratic lawmakers to begin working with Republicans on a “big, bold and transformational infrastructure package.”\During the presidential campaign, Biden laid the groundwork by proposing $2 trillion in “accelerated” investments to shift to cleaner energy, build half a million charging stations for electric vehicles, support public transit and repair roads and bridges. The plan emphasizes the importance of creating unionized jobs and addressing climate change.\The White House originally planned to come out with a plan in February, but more recently hasn’t committed to a timeline. A rollout is likely to slide into April as the administration embarks on a nationwide push over the coming weeks to sell Americans on the benefits of the COVID-19 relief bill.\Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., chairman of House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, hope to pass a bill out of their committees in May.\The package could include policy changes — on green energy and immigration — and even try to make permanent some of the just-passed COVID-19 assistance such as child tax credits.\“It is going to be green and it is going to be big,” DeFazio told The Associated Press.\Democrats used a fast-track budget process known as reconciliation to approve Biden’s COVID-19 relief plan without Republican support, a strategy that succeeded despite the reservations of some moderates.\But work on passing infrastructure legislation in a Senate split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris providing a tiebreaking vote will probably prove more difficult. Moderate Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., recently made clear he will block infrastructure legislation if Republicans aren’t included.\Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 3 Senate Republican, said he wants to see bipartisan support for an infrastructure legislation. But he said the House in the last Congress refused to embrace a $287 billion bill unanimously passed by a Senate committee and changed it in a way that Republicans could not accept.\“What did the House do? They replaced our highway bill with the Green New Deal,” Barrasso said. “So they ignored what we have done in a bipartisan way. If they would take the model that we came up with in the committee in the Senate for highway and transportation, I think that’s a very good start. I talked with the secretary of transportation, Pete Buttigieg, about it, and I think that is the model on which we should move forward on transportation and infrastructure.”\On Sunday, Pelosi declined to say whether tax increases would be required for the House legislation, stressing that Congress would explore all options, including generating revenue with something similar to the Obama administration’s Build America bonds.\Cost will be a major hurdle in passing an infrastructure plan. There’s little political interest in increasing the 18.3-cent-per-gallon federal gas tax, which generates revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, even though the rate has not increased since 1993. Biden promised during the campaign he would not increase taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year.\“This is about broadband. It’s about water systems. It’s about mass transit, it’s about good paying jobs all over the country,” she said. “It’s also about schools and housing and the rest. ... So the goal is to promote good growth, creating good-paying jobs as we protect our planet and are fiscally sound.”\Pelosi and Barrasso spoke on ABC’s “This Week.”"

Now, investigators across the country are hoping a vial of Bundy's blood -- kept as part of a case record -- will prove or disprove his involvement in cold cases dating as far back as 1961. Bundy's blood, recovered from an evidence lab in Columbia County, Florida, will be entered into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) on Friday.

Mustafa Naji al-Mrabet's left hand and feet were bandaged, there were bloodstains on his robes, and the valve for an intravenous needle still stuck out of his arm. He was both a husband and a father, deep in mourning. Nearby, his brother-in-law, 26-year-old Abubakr Ali cried like a child. Ali pulled back the blankets covering two small coffins. Inside lay the bloody bodies of his nephews, Mohamed and Motez al-Mrabet, ages 5 and 3. Their mother, Ibtisam, lie in a coffin beside them. All three were killed early Thursday as they slept, neighbors and relatives said, when their house on the outskirts of this coastal city was hit by a NATO airstrike. Family members said a third child, 8-year-old Naji, was in intensive care after suffering serious injuries.

Libya-Tiji-Watchers By Michael Holmes
\
The lonely ridge that tops the Nafusa Mountains has been used for centuries as a lookout point, a place where enemies are watched. Two thousand years ago, Berber men would sit in a stone lookout over the majestic brown plains, watching for strangers or enemies approaching their villages. Today, their ancestors use the same ridgeline to watch over their own enemies -- the forces of Moammar Gadhafi entrenched in the dusty city of Tiji below.

The water is expected to be briny because previous study of the planet has shown that its surface is salty, so any water that flows in the subsurface is going to be salty. Seven such sites on the planet have been confirmed, with 20 more possible. ""It is our first chance to see an environment on Mars that might allow for the expression of an active biological process, if there is presently life on Mars,"" said Lisa Pratt, professor of geological sciences at Indiana University, Bloomington.

""Wigger"" is as a slang term for ""a white person who emulates the mannerisms, language and fashions associated with African-American culture,"" according to a Wikipedia entry, the definition cited in the lawsuit. It is said to be a slur that combines the words ""white"" or ""wannabe"" with the word ""nigger.""

The mayor will contribute $30 million from his personal philanthropic foundation to the effort, which is a public-private partnership. Another $30 million will come from billionaire hedge funder George Soros' Open Society Foundations. The city will pick up an additional $67.5 million in costs. The mayor said the initiative will target four areas identified as having the greatest racial disparity: education, health, employment and the justice system. But some experts fear the initiative doesn't address the real problems in education.

Some 50,000 are projected to come from state and local governments. And things won't get better anytime soon. The state and local government sector could shed around 110,000 jobs in the third quarter, which would top the massive downsizing that occurred in the early 1980s. ""The sector keeps bleeding jobs,"" Daco said. ""The third quarter could be the worst ever."" All told, the state and local government sector has lost 577,000 jobs since its peak in September 2008. Some 224,000 of those have been in education.

\
This week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the latest data on HIV in the United States, and it should give us all pause: 30 years into the epidemic, about 50,000 Americans still become infected with the virus each year. While that number is far too high, it has remained fairly steady for the past several years, the report found. As more people than ever before are living with HIV, there are more opportunities to transmit the virus. So the ""steadiness"" of new infections indicates that HIV prevention efforts are helping to avert a resurgence. Given what we know about HIV prevention efforts from the 1980s until today, the situation with HIV in this country could have been far worse than it already is.

Support your local festival
\
It is Trails West! time again- an event that St. Joseph and the region looks forward to each August. The festival has grown from humble origins nine years ago to an annual arts festival that attracts 85,000 visitors and has been ranked one of the two best in the entire state, second only to the long-established arts fair in St. Louis.
\
After months of planning, soon 2,210 volunteers, presenters, artists, vendors, crafters and performers will fill Civic Center Park with music, art, food and fun. This years co-chairs, Sam and Christy Barber, have put in long hours as volunteer leaders of Trails West! and deserve our profound thanks.
\
People sometimes ask what they can do to help keep Trails West! an event of the very highest quality. Our response is: Come to the event, purchase a button and a T-shirt and patronize the food and beverage vendors. Even though Trails West! has no admission charge, we do receive a percentage on sales of food, drink and merchandise, which helps defray the cost of presenting the festival.
\
There is another important way to support the festival that will help us improve the quality each year - and that is by purchasing items from the fine arts, folk arts and crafts area. The artists and artisans that exhibit there have gone through a juried process - meaning that they have submitted pictures of their work from which a panel of judges chooses the best and most appropriate work to be shown and sold. This year we have a total of 35 artists in the fine art area - 16 of them new to Trails West! In the folk art-craft area we have 35 - 11 of them new. While some of them are from St. Joseph and this area, others travel from a distance, rent a motel room and stay to exhibit and sell their art. Trails West! treats the artists very well - in fact, we have a national reputation for the hospitality we offer.
\
Members of the community can help us by purchasing an item from the fine art or folk art area. If an artist has good sales, he or she is more likely to want to come back and to tell other artists that St. Joseph has a good festival. The word does get around and gives our community a good reputation in the festival world. As news of our success spreads, the quality of artists who apply will continue to go up.
\
This year there will be a representative sampling of many media: oils, watercolors, stone sculpture, jewelry, pewter art, glass, leather, lithographs and photography.
\
We hope to see everyone at Trails West! this weekend and please, do consider supporting this wonderful arts festival by making a purchase of art. You will be helping the event and also have a nice work of art for your personal enjoyment.
\
Happy Trails!!

As I see it
\
How do you rate the highways in Missouri? A friend of mine just got back from a trip to the East Coast by car and told me he thought Missouri should be called the ""patchwork "" state. I asked him why. His reply was that every highway you drive on in Missouri is patched. When you think about it you realize he's right. Take Missouri Highway 13 from Higginsville to Lexington. It was resurfaced in 1999 and today it has already been patched many times. Just recently I went to Lexington and was going to count all the new patches, but gave up. Look at Highway 13 south of Higginsville to Interstate 70. That was resurfaced in 1993, yet today you can't find a place that hasn't been patched. If you drive any of these highways in the rain you will find out that it is very dangerous, because of the low places where the large trucks have worn it into a groove, water stands in these grooves and your tires hydroplane. I have a feeling that a lot of wrecks are caused by this when you cannot control your steering because of the hydroplaning. Why are these roads falling apart so quick? Is the state allowing substandard material or substandard work to be done just to get a new surface on the road? Are inspectors being paid to look the other way by the asphalt companies? In this last session of our Legislature, they couldn't reach an agreement on a plan for funding Missouri highways, yet they managed to come to agreement on funding basketball and football stadiums for a few. Millions of people travel our state highway system daily, yet no way was found for funding a good highway program. Will Missouri have the distinction of being known for the worst highways in the states? Some people I have talked with suggest that our highways could be very good and last a long time, but they say that there is quite a difference in the quality of asphalt. It is kind of like you get what you pay for.
\
One of the problems on the highways is the damage the heavy trucks do. Yet no one wants to buck the trucking people. Take Highway 13 from Lexington to Clinton and then on south to Collins. They have been hauling sand from the river on that route for the past several years while they are building new highway. The heavy trucks have worn a place in the highway almost enough that your car will steer itself. I travel that road every week and I have never seen a truck stopped by the portable scales or the Highway Patrol. Maybe the Highway Department has an agreement with the Highway Patrol and the weights division that they won't stop any trucks hauling sand. Whatever the reasons for Missouri's poor highways, with the gas tax that we pay we should be able to have decent and safe highways to drive on. Ask your state Senator and Representative what they plan to do about the problem. Locally call your alderman or city manager and ask them to take a ride with you around your ward and show them how bad the streets are. They may not know.

Friend will be missed
\
There was only one LeRoy Maxwell, a unique jovial, yet very seriously dedicated family man, ""positive"" public servant, college professor, juvenile officer, 1950s police officer, civic volunteer and truly a great supportive friend to many who loved the guy. The only consolation of bidding ""Bud"" Maxwell good-bye will be that this caring, beautiful human being has fulfilled a multiplex mission on earth and I am sure that as the Bible states God will say: ""Thy servant well done.""
\
I knew Leroy 45 out his 70 years. He was my college professor in criminal justice administration at Missouri Western in the early 1970s, a faculty sponsor of the College Veterans Club and my supervisor in a three-month 1972 College Practicum at his Buchanan County Juvenile office. Jill Ann Miller and Johnnie Johnson were also students at the juvenile office. Rita Flynn, now district probation parole chief, was a deputy officer.
\
As an eight-year producer for the local F.O.P.'s summer 1970s stadium country shows and the police department 1980s policeman's ball, it was always a great personal treat to have a humorous visit with my buddy, LeRoy Maxwell, who never once ever failed me as a friend.
\
Those trips home from ""Music City""offered a special treat in those visits.
\
To any person who fails to vote or declines to participate as an activist in the American political process, predicating their lack of faith and action on crooked politicians, I present to you a ""public servant"" of impeccable service. There are others like him. Look for them as a reason for self-participation and not to the ones who bring shame on a credible profession. That's a ""cop-out"" and LeRoy Maxwell was never a ""cop-out."" He went beyond the call of duty.
\
I would say to Missouri Western College, please name the criminal justice building on your campus the LeRoy Maxwell Building. I would say to the city, please designate a portion of the Southwest Parkway to his name. He's worthy of the above.

Our best to Elaine and your family, Bud. So many of us want a reunion with you someday. You truly left our city, county and regional law enforcement better environments. God Bless you.

194,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."
195,"President Obama didn't say it in his recent speech, but he should have:\We all have oil on our hands, not just BP.\All of us who drive vehicles, fly on airplanes, use petroleum-based products are responsible for the catastrophic oil leak and spread in the Gulf of Mexico, and the consequent environmental and economic damage, because we're all dependent on seemingly unlimited and relatively cheap oil.\Because we're responsible for the devastation of the gulf, if only indirectly, we're also responsible for the prevention of future disasters.\We must become more faithful stewards of creation and insist upon greater supervision of and, where warranted, punishment of corporations that act cavalierly toward our environment.\Not all damage can be contained or repaired. Once an oil-feathered pelican dies, it stays dead.\We also must take other action, including: supporting a gas tax, the revenue from which will help fund research into and development of alternative, clean forms of energy; reducing our driving, hopping on bicycles instead of into our cars to run those errands; and trading in our monster SUVs for energy-efficient vehicles.\Both my wife and I enjoy our hybrid cars, especially our savings on gas and the satisfaction of knowing we're doing a small part to care for creation.\And we Americans must pressure our elected officials, urging them to shift funds from road and highway repair, improvement, and expansion to the laying of light rails for trains (Kansas City, I'm told, is doing just this; St. Louis already has); expanding bus service, including to outlying areas, and building more bike lanes and trails.\No, the president didn't say it in his 18-minute address to the nation, but he should have:\We all have oil on our hands, and it's time we wash it off by acting in new, bold, and even sacrificial ways for the preservation of God's gift of creation.\The Rev.

CHICAGO (AP) - Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton accused Paul Tsongas on Friday of wanting to pound the middle class ""into the dirt"" as the three Democratic candidates for the presidential nomination met to debate.
\
Clinton, Tsongas and former California Gov. Jerry Brown will face the voters Tuesday in primaries in Illinois and Michigan.
\
Clinton lashed out at Tsongas after the former Massachusetts senator suggested that Clinton's proposed middle-class tax cut was ""candy"" to voters at a time when the nation needed sacrifice.
\
Clinton, who leads in polls in both states, called Tsongas the campaign's ""Santa Claus for the rich,"" offering the wealthy a capital-gains tax cut while refusing to give ""tax fairness"" to the middle class.
\
The three Democratic candidates sparred over crime and drugs, industrial policy and how best to bring jobs to union workers and inner-city neighborhoods.
\
Brown repeatedly bid for labor support, criticizing his Democratic rivals and President George Bush for supporting a free-trade agreement with Mexico. Brown said such an agreement would cost American jobs and exploit Mexico's workers and environment.
\
Brown also accused Clinton of promoting ""slave labor"" in Arkansas, a right-to-work state, during economic development missions to Korea.
\
But the sharpest exchange of the night came as Tsongas and Clinton debated their economic proposals for statewide television audiences in Illinois and Michigan.
\
""What this country needs is a leader who will say to them, 'No more candy, no more Santa Claus,' "" Tsongas said.
\
Pointing to Tsongas, Clinton retorted: ""He wants to continue to pound the middle class and lower middle class into the dirt. . . . He wants to give the rich something and punish the working class.""
\
As evidence, Clinton cited Tsongas' plan to raise the gas tax by 50 cents over the next 10 years and give the wealthy a capital-gains tax reduction.
\
The free-for-all came during a 60-minute debate broadcast by CBS affiliates in both industrial states.
\
Brown's shot at Clinton was backed the pro-labor message he has been promoting in an effort to win over union workers.
\
""Governor Clinton went to Korea and bragged . . . 'Come over here, we've got slave labor here,' "" Brown said.
\
Clinton did not respond to Brown's attack.
\
Meanwhile Friday, a poll of Michigan voters released by Michigan State University showed 34 percent of Democrats favoring Clinton, 19 percent for Tsongas and 10 percent for Brown, with 37 percent undecided.
\
And a poll for the Chicago Sun-Times and Fox News released late Friday showed Clinton favored by 48 percent of Democratic voters in Illinois, to 21 percent for Tsongas and 7 percent for Brown.

I try to stay a positive person, but a glance at the August ballot amendments has shaken my resolve. Take a look.
\
Amendment 1: The right to farm or ranch shall not be infringed. Couldn't this protect a farmer who wants to grow marijuana, especially if he claims it is for medicinal purposes? There have to be regulations that keep our food and environment safe, and our water clean.
\
Amendment 5: The state government must uphold the right to keep and bear arms. So what's new? Putting it in the Constitution won't do anything other than force costly lawsuits the state can't win.
\
Amendment 7: Create a three-quarters cent sales tax to fix roads and bridges. This work should be paid for by those who benefit. A gasoline tax or toll roads make more sense - the more you drive, the more you pay. I know people resist a new gas tax, but that's no reason to take it out of grandma's pocket.
\
Amendment 8: Create a ""Veteran's Lottery Ticket."" This takes a constitutional amendment? Just pass a law that assures the money goes to veterans and start one.
\
Amendment 9: Keep electronic data secure. People are told they should worry about ""privacy,"" but personally I don't have anything I'm embarrassed about and if an occasional glance at my cell phone or e-mails along with those of others will help catch some criminals, terrorists or child molesters, have at it.
\
Sorry, politicians, I know you want to be able to point to these amendments at election time and say, ""Look what I did for you,"" but there's not one there I can feel positive about. I'm voting five ""no's.""

198,"GLOBAL WARMING\WHEN it comes to doing something about global warming, the nation that spews the most greenhouse gases is taking small steps where a giant leap for mankind is required.\Texaco became the third Fortune 500 company in recent months to drop out of the Global Climate Coalition, the primary lobbying group to challenge the theory of global warming.\Texaco follows Ford and Daimler/Chrysler in deserting the coalition, made up of oil, auto, coal and petrochemical companies, and electric utilities. In the last three years, Dow Chemical, Royal Dutch Shell and BP/Amoco also opted out of the coalition, which contends that what is melting polar ice caps and producing record warm years is a natural phenomenon unrelated to the burning of fossil fuels in cars and factories.\Texaco stated that the ""protracted debate about the adequacy of science is something Texaco wishes to move beyond."" But the great beyond does not include taking the leap to support the 1997 Kyoto global-warming treaty.\Auto manufacturers won't take the leap of easing up on promotion of trendy, gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles, and moving faster on developing affordable hybrid or alternatively powered cars.\President Bill Clinton won't or can't make the leap to enact truly meaningful legislation, encouraging serious development of non- fossil fuels or reforming the ""light-truck"" mileage standards of SUVs, which now account for 40 percent of all new cars. Members of Congress, beholden to campaign contributors, also will not take the leap to attack a problem that is not yet burdensome in day-to-day life. As sprawl widens around St. Louis and Kansas City, the Missouri Legislature will not take the leap to reform the gas tax so some of it could be spent on mass transit. Few commuters take the leap to organize car pools. Even fewer decide to move closer to work in smaller dwellings that are easier to heat and cool.\Vice President Al Gore wrote a book called ""Earth in the Balance,"" in which he states that rescuing the environment should be ""the central organizing principle for civilization."" But he won't take the leap and make it even a central organizing principle of his own campaign. Other candidates talk about it even less.\Autos emit about 20 percent of global warming pollution and consume about 40 percent of the oil we use. Motorists help enable all of the above.\The defection of Texaco and other gas and auto companies is being credited with helping move the global warming debate toward center stage. With gas prices shooting up and the world heating up, Texaco and all of us should go beyond small steps and take some leaps."
199,"(Editor's note: The Missouri House on Wednesday approved a proposed constitutional amendment to impose a three-quarters-of-a-cent sales tax for transportation if voters approve.)\Everyone wants good roads, but no one wants to pay for them.\There are four main ways to pay for roads: tolls, fuel taxes, sales taxes and vehicle registration fees. A fifth method of a per-mile fee, though proposed in various forms, has gained little traction. Here are a few quick facts and thoughts.\The Missouri Department of Transportation proposed a toll on Interstate 70 three years ago under dubious legal authority, and even if that legal authority were there at the time, it has run out. A state cannot impose a toll on a federal interstate highway that is currently not tolled without specific authority from the feds to do so.\Tolls are also inefficient. Depending on which current toll network you look at, anywhere from 7 percent to 12 percent of the toll is lost to the administration and collection of the toll. Fuel and sales taxes lose less than 2 percent.\A 1-cent gas tax increase in Missouri will produce just north of $30 million, and a 1-cent diesel tax increase will produce about $10 million for roads and bridges. This is split under a predetermined formula between the state (the lion's share) and cities and counties.\According to the fiscal note of the current proposal, a 1-cent sales and vehicle tax increase would produce approximately $719 million a year for roads and bridges if passed by voters.\All of these methods have positives and negatives. Tolls on Missouri interstates, for now at least, are off the table, so let's start with additional fuel taxes.\Missouri does have one of the lowest fuel taxes in the nation, but any meaningful increase in state fuel taxes would also have to be approved by voters, and it polls terribly. Fuel taxes are also losing ground because of alternative-fuel vehicles and higher miles per gallon achievement by traditional-fuel vehicles.\There has been no meaningful move toward taxing alternative-fuel vehicles such as natural gas and electric ones. These automobiles and trucks may be better for the environment, but use the same roads, causing the same wear. As an example, a 2014 gasoline Ford Focus weighs in at 2,960 pounds while the electric hatch version weighs in at 3,640 pounds, according to the Ford website.\A general sales tax is more broad but open to criticism of falling more on the poor and even those that don't own an automobile and claim to not use the roads. It should be noted though that basic necessities such as food and medicine are not subject to the state sales tax, and everyone uses the roads to get their goods and services.\Roads are not just more expensive because of inflation, they are more expensive because we demand more in the building of them. Wider shoulders and other requirements add to the cost.\Every major survey shows that citizens desire a good road network, and any business looking at relocating places a solid transportation network near the top of its lists of needs. In my next article I will offer some of my ideas to help pay for needed infrastructure.\Thomas Long represented the 130th District in the Missouri House of Representatives 2010-12. He lives in Battlefield and can be contacted at tlongmissouri@gmail.com.\Thomas\LONG"
200,"Term limits law contributes to legislators' antics\What happened to ""The welfare of the people shall be the supreme law""? When I voted for a Democrat to be my state representative, I didn't realize that I was voting for a DINO and a quisling voting with the Republicans to override the governor's veto of the tax cut.\Wouldn't it make sense to pay for road improvements with an increase in the gas tax or even the cigarette tax? People with moderate and low income will be unfairly impacted by an increase in the sales tax.\We are reaping the fruits of our term limits law. Every election we send a new batch of inexperienced legislators from our gerrymandered districts. There seems to be a mindset to get as much as you can while you're here. After all, the American Legislative Exchange Council and the lobbyists will write most of bills that you vote on.\I am truly embarrassed by the antics of our legislators. It would be funny, if it weren't so tragic.\Doyle Perry * Florissant\Transfer problem won't be fixed unless it affects St. Louis' royalty\About that schools transfer problem. Apparently it can't be solved. And even if there were a solution hidden somewhere, our so-called leaders can't find it and won't fund it.\Well, there is a remedy, but it'll never happen.\Pass legislation allowing the transferees from the failing districts to end up at John Burroughs and Mary Institute and Country Day School. I have a feeling that once St. Louis' royalty is impacted, they'll jerk the strings of their puppets in Jefferson City and the problem will be solved pronto.\All it takes is a little skin in the game to get the true decision makers to demand a solution that everyone can live with.\Jeff Klayman * St. Louis County\Donate to charity instead of buying pricey dresses\The front page story ""Girls go formal at graduation"" (May 19), about formal white dresses, many quite expensive, for high school graduation made for a quick reflection back to my two daughters' graduation from Visitation Academy in the early '90s. They wore the same type of gowns following spring break trips and lots of dollars spent on their senior proms. As a father, I remember feeling satisfied. It all seemed so right.\Not so when I read the article on Monday. It came after the Sunday Post-Dispatch cover story ""The grade divide,"" on the chasm between the poor and the middle class within grade and high school education. In such a context, how out of touch, how inappropriate these dresses now seemed bereft of any life lessons for the private school graduates.\Traditions are wonderful, but they must evolve to remain relevant. It is my hope that the white dresses remain but very modestly priced. For each graduate, the money saved should become their personal mini-fund to be donated to a charity whether international, national or local.\Gather a book of stories detailing why each graduate selected her specific charity. Announce at commencement how much money in aggregate had been donated. Then, offer a prayer (because private schools can easily do so) that somehow quality education will be available to all and that students can pursue academics within a household environment that is conducive to study.\Dick Schenk * Ballwin\Abortion care isn't safe for the child being killed\One of your letter writers accused legislators of throwing women under the bus for passing restrictive reproduction legislation (""Longer waiting period for abortion is a step backward,"" May 18). The living human beings killed by abortion don't even have the chance to get thrown under the bus.\She mentions Planned Parenthood provides safe abortion care. How safe is it for the child whose life is being terminated?\Deacon Richard Schellhase * St. Louis County\Media paint inaccurate image of North County\The news media of St. Louis missed another story this last weekend. More than 2,000 people hit the streets of Ferguson (in dreaded North County) and police blocked off numerous areas for several hours. You all missed this story because it was a peaceful, fun community event, where a huge multicultural gathering of all ages met and enjoyed a pleasant May evening together in a great setting. This was the 5th Annual Ferguson Twilight Run, a 5K and 10K run/walk through pleasant tree-lined neighborhoods and city streets.\Participants new to the event discovered what the rest of us know too well: that the image the media paint of North County is one-sided and inaccurate. Yes, we have problems, and of those, the rest of the metro area learns in great detail, but the good and positive things are routinely ignored entirely.\Jim Leighninger * Florissant"
201,"
It's the economy, stupid,"" proclaimed James Carville, Bill Clinton's chief 1992 campaign guru. Indeed, it was. It's the economy that has been the dominant and decisive issue in 20th century American presidential politics. Every once in a while a war or some other diversion pops up, but place your bet on the economy as to what will most influence the outcome in the run for the White House.
\
Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter and George Bush can all attest to this political truism. Hoover was ousted by the Great Depression. Carter had a couple of big problems - including the Iranian hostage crisis - but it was stagflation and 20 percent prime interest rates that were his principal undoing. Bush plummeted from a 90 percent approval rating to defeat because the economy was in recession, and the recovery didn't manifest itself soon enough to rescue him.
\
As of now, Clinton's economy is the stuff of a winner. Unemployment is down. Inflation is down. The ""misery index"" (unemployment plus inflation) is extremely low - lower than any time since the 1960s. The federal deficit is 1.9 percent of gross domestic product; it was 4.9 percent in 1992.
\
Remember back in 1980 when Ronald Reagan was debating Carter and asked, ""Are you better off than you were four years ago?"" That question is now a part of almost any presidential election poll. Last week's NBC poll had 46 percent responding yes, I am better off; 20 percent no, I am worse off. When Clinton ran against Bush in 1992, the worse-off number was significantly larger than the better-off one.
\
All of this means that Dole has to come up with an economic counter-strategy, preferably a blockbuster. How about these?
\
Things appear to be pretty good, but I can do better. Tepid.
\
Things appear to be pretty good, but a Clinton economic disaster is right around the corner. Won't sell.
\
An economic bombshell. A massive tax cut - the second coming of Supply Side. If only for lack of a better alternative, Dole is about to dive head first into Voodoo II. This is what Speaker Newt Gingrich and Jack Kemp are urging Dole to do.
\
For all of his political career, Dole has been a balance-the-budget type. He had, on occasion, even supported higher taxes when he thought it was necessary to reduce deficits.
\
As Herb Stein, chief economic adviser to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, puts it, Republicans seem poised to repackage the lovely notion that the more you lower taxes, the more tax revenue comes in via the stimulated economy. Supply-side economics was holy scripture to Reagan. When he came into office, the federal debt was 26.8 percent of gross domestic product. Today it's 50 percent plus - and climbing.
\
Supply-side economics failed in 1981 and, with an even greater debt now generated, it would fail in 1997. Supply-side deficits grew from $79 billion in 1981 to $207 billion in 1985 to $290 billion in 1992. Stein writes, ""We could afford Ronald Reagan once. We can't afford him again.""
\
Dole knows Steve Forbes' flat tax at 17 percent would be a budgetary catastrophe. ""Snake oil,"" Dole called it in the Iowa caucus. So all he's got left is some reprocessed Reaganomics: lower rates, dropping the top rate to 28 percent from 39 percent; reducing capital gains tax; tax-free savings accounts; easing the ""marriage tax."" While promising mega billions in tax cuts, he has to make a bunch of promises: not to touch Social Security; no huge whacks at Medicare; increase defense spending; no cuts for veterans; no cuts in law enforcement or narcotics control; strong support for research, training and education; continued protection of the environment.
\
It won't work. You cannot tax-cut yourself into a balanced budget.
\
Clinton will not be caught off guard. He's ready to play in the tax-cutting contest. When Dole was prepared to repeal the gas tax, Clinton was right there with a ""count me in."" Clinton has never seen an offer he couldn't seek to match. He has some tax tidbits of his own directed toward college education. For Clinton, there is no concept too small to advocate. In lost revenues, Clinton's proposals are chicken feed compared to the upcoming Dole cuts.
\
Dole knows he will find precious few economists who are willing to support an across-the-board tax cut as the way to increase federal revenues. But fiscal prudence and austerity aren't the way you run for president. ""If that's what you want, I'll be another Ronald Reagan,"" Dole once said. There was only one Ronald Reagan.

202,"
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Former Sen. Paul Tsongas hit the beaches in advance of Florida's pivotal primary on Tuesday with a frontal assault on the character and campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
\
Tsongas is trying to overtake Clinton, his chief Democratic rival, with pointed speeches and television ads that accuse Clinton of ""pandering"" for votes and distorting Tsongas' record.
\
""We're going to make people understand that a man who would divide the country and use code words is unacceptable,"" Tsongas, of Massachusetts, said in a speech on Friday night.
\
In Florida, Tsongas has his best opportunity to break Clinton's hold on the predominantly Southern states that will have primaries and caucuses along with Missouri on Tuesday. Tsongas has gained on Clinton in Florida, and polls last week showed them in a dead heat.
\
When Tsongas arrived ahead of Clinton for campaigning this weekend, he deployed his most aggressive tactics since he started his campaign almost a year ago.
\
He charged that Clinton had endorsed building new submarines chiefly as a means to attract voters in Connecticut, where they would be manufactured. Clinton made the proposal during a debate on Thursday night; Connecticut's primary is March 24.
\
""Anybody who plays with peoples' passions in that cynical way has no right to be running for president,"" Tsongas said during a rally at a Greek Orthodox church.
\
Tsongas also accused Clinton of using an ethnic reference when he pronounced some of Tsongas' campaign proposals as ""not American.""
\
""It is a code to say, 'he's different, he's ethnic'. Let me say to Bill Clinton that there are a lot of people in this country who come from ethnic stock. We're Americans,"" Tsongas added.
\
Florida's primary loomed big for the Democratic aspirants. Tsongas and Clinton planned to campaign heavily in the state this weekend.
\
For Clinton, Florida presents the weakest link in his effort to sweep Southern states on Tuesday before candidates move to Illinois and Michigan on March 17.
\
Jeff Eller, Clinton's Florida campaign manager, said that Clinton intended to remind voters when he arrived on Saturday that Tsongas supports an increase in the federal gasoline tax. Florida's tourism industry has suffered during the recession because people have had less money for travel.
\
""We will be panning for gold on the gas tax, and I think it will help,"" Eller said. ""We feel that we are in good shape in Florida, but we know we have a fight on our hands with Paul Tsongas.""
\
Tsongas hoped to attract liberal voters in South Florida and to cut into Clinton's strength among blacks. He has lagged far behind Clinton in organizing both segments of voters.
\
Clinton has run strong among blacks in other states; he captured 70 percent of the black vote in Georgia last week and 55 percent in Maryland, even though he lost Maryland to Tsongas.
\
T. Willard Fair, president of the Urban League of Miami, said that what little interest blacks in Florida were showing toward this year's Democratic candidates is directed at Clinton.
\
""People are tending to look at the decisions of a select few in our community when it comes to voting for president, and Bill Clinton was able to cash in on the pawnbrokers early,"" he said.
\
Tsongas was scheduled to campaign in a black neighborhood on Saturday. Gerald Austin, a consultant, said that forecasts for a low turnout among blacks on Tuesday would diminish Clinton's advantage.
\
Tsongas scored heavily this week among another segment of voters, environmentalists. He corralled endorsements from most of Florida's environmental leaders, among them 101-year-old Marjory Stoneman Douglas, who has written books about the Everglades.
\
Although Florida's Cuban-American population remains staunchly Republican, Tsongas made inroads recently into a new generation that is both opposed to Fidel Castro and pro-environment. Tsongas opposes opening trade with Cuba.
\
Julio Sanjul, whose family owns vast sugar cane croplands in South Florida, said that he was attracted by Tsongas' early commitment to fight global warming. As a senator 10 years ago, Tsongas sponsored hearings on the dangers of pollution gathering in the upper atmosphere, believed to be a cause of changing climate.
\
""If the weather gets five degrees warmer up in Missouri, it might be a welcome relief. Down here, it would mean lost coastlines and flooding disasters like we have never seen,"" said Sanjul, an official with the South Florida Water Management District.
\
Tsongas also moved to hold down Clinton's advantage among older voters, a key part of the electorate in Florida.
\
In a television ad, Tsongas accused Clinton of distorting his record by saying that Tsongas had sought to cut Social Security. Tsongas was one of 60 senators who voted against cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security recipients in 1984, and has advocated taxing benefits of wealthy people.
\
But aides to Tsongas say he doesn't want to cut Social Security.

203,"
When tax season rolls around, it's only natural for taxpayers to wonder just what their hard-earned federal tax dollars pay for, anyway.
\
Washington will spend $25,117 per household in 2008 - the highest total since World War II, and an inflation-adjusted $4,300 more than in 2001. The federal government will collect $21,604 per household in taxes. The remaining $3,513 represents this year's budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.
\
Washington will spend this $25,117 per household as follows:
\
- Social Security/Medicare: $8,668. The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of these costs. This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers. If nothing is done, taxes eventually will need to rise by $12,000 per household - adjusted for both inflation and rising incomes - to pay all promised benefits.
\
- Defense: $5,204. The defense budget covers everything from military salaries to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the research, development and acquisition of new technologies. Lawmakers drastically reduced defense spending after the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks reversed this trend, and the inflation-adjusted $1,794 per household increase since 2001 has returned defense spending closer to its historical levels.
\
- Antipoverty programs: $3,752. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. Other low-income spending includes: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, housing subsidies, child-care subsidies, Supplemental Security Income and low-income tax credits. Despite recent rhetoric about ""cuts for poor,"" federal antipoverty spending now tops 3 percent of gross domestic product for the first time ever, and state and local governments add an additional 2 percent of GDP.
\
- Interest on the federal debt: $2,090. The federal government is $9.6 trillion in debt. It owes $5.4 trillion to public bond owners, and the rest to other federal agencies, mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund, which lawmakers raid annually. Despite rising debt, record-low interest rates have limited costs. As interest rates rise back to normal levels, these costs will spike.
\
- Federal employee retirement benefits: $935. This spending funds the retirement and disability benefits of federal employees, including the military.
\
- Veterans' benefits: $742. The federal government provides income and health benefits to war veterans. Spending is up 47 percent since 2001.
\
- Health research/regulation: $692. This spending is up 44 percent since 2001, and much of this growth is concentrated in the National Institute of Health. The category also includes the Food and Drug Administration and dozens of grant programs for health providers.
\
- Education: $578. Education spending is primarily a state and local function; 9 percent of the total comes from Washington. Federal education spending has surged 47 percent since the 2001 enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act. Most federal dollars are spent on low-income school districts, special education and college student financial aid.
\
- Highways/mass transit: $455. Most highway and mass-transit spending is financed by the 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gas tax. Washington subtracts an administrative cost and sends this money back to the states with numerous strings attached. Some economists suggest it would be more efficient to let states collect this tax and decide how to spend the money themselves.
\
- Justice administration: $396. Justice spending includes federal attorneys and prisons, as well as law enforcement grant programs. New homeland security costs have added $100 per household to justice spending.
\
- Unemployment benefits: $320. Unemployment costs fluctuate based on the number of unemployed Americans.
\
- Natural resources/environment: $305. This includes national parks, federal lands, water projects and environmental clean-up.
\
International affairs: $298. This includes foreign economic and military assistance, operation of American embassies abroad, and contributions to organizations such as the United Nations. International spending has nearly doubled since 9/11.
\
The programs listed above cover $24,435 per household. The remaining $682 is allocated to all other federal programs, including regional development, farm subsidies, social services, space exploration, air transportation and energy.
\
Taxpayers must decide for themselves whether they're getting their money's worth.

\
(CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Thursday his Republican critics promising immediate lower gas prices are either uninformed or dishonest, and he pledged in a speech to University of Miami students to continue pushing for alternative energy sources.
\
Framing the issue as ""one of the major challenges of your generation,"" Obama said developing a broad-based energy policy incorporating all sources -- oil, gas, nuclear, solar, wind and alternatives such as algae -- would take years but was essential for the nation's future economic well-being.
\
His speech came as gas prices soared around the nation, rising 3.3 cents nationwide overnight to $3.61 a gallon, according to AAA.
\
GOP presidential challenger Newt Gingrich and other Republicans complain Obama is bowing to foreign oil suppliers such as Saudi Arabia and the environmental lobby by not fully exploiting U.S. oil reserves.
\
At the Republican debate in Arizona on Wednesday night, Gingrich introduced himself by saying he had ""developed a program for American energy so no future president will ever bow to a Saudi king again and so every American can look forward to $2.50 a gallon gasoline.""
\
Without naming Gingrich, Obama appeared to target that remark Thursday, saying to cheers that ""anyone who tells you we can drill our way out of this problem doesn't know what they're talking about -- or just isn't telling you the truth.""
\
""It's the easiest thing in the world to make phony election-year promises about lower gas prices,"" Obama said. ""What's harder is to make a serious, sustained commitment to tackle a problem. And it won't be solved in one year, it won't be solved in one term, it may not be solved in one decade. But that's the kind of commitment we need right now.""
\
He touted current U.S. oil production as being at its highest level in eight years, and he said U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports has decreased, dropping below 50% in 2010.
\
Obama also listed steps taken under his energy policy, including approval for new nuclear plants; opening more territory including in the Arctic region to exploration and development; an agreement signed with Mexico this week to cooperate on developing oil and gas reserves along their maritime border; increasing fuel efficiency standards in cars and trucks, and developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power.
\
Because of the new fuel standards, he said, in the middle of the next decade ""you'll be able to fill up your car every two weeks instead of every week -- something that, over time, will save the typical family more than $8,000 at the pump.""
\
""And it means this country will reduce our oil consumption by more than 2 million barrels a day,"" Obama added to applause. ""That's not only good for your pocketbook, that's good for the environment.""
\
He also made an obvious reference to the bankrupt Solyndra solar panel company that had received $500 million in federal loan guarantees, saying public investment in new technology doesn't pay off right away.
\
""Some technologies don't pan out; and some companies will fail,"" Obama said. ""But as long as I'm president, I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.""
\
Repeating that external factors such as Middle East instability cause fluctuating oil prices, Obama insisted that ""there isn't a silver bullet. There never has been.""
\
The rising gas price threatens to slow signs of consistent economic recovery in recent months, and Republican critics have focused on the issue as the November presidential election campaign heats up.
\
Obama ridiculed that strategy, mentioning a news headline that said the rising gas price has Republicans ""licking their chops.""
\
""Only in politics do people root for bad news,"" Obama said, saying the unlimited oil drilling advocated by Republicans won't solve America's long-term energy needs.
\
""It's not a strategy to solve our energy challenge,"" he continued to applause. ""It's a strategy to get politicians through an election. You know there are no quick fixes to this problem, and you know we can't just drill our way to lower gas prices.""
\
Before the speech, Obama toured the university's Industrial Assessment Center, where students learn how to help manufacturers reduce energy costs.
\
The government should support such research and innovation, the president said in his speech, and he called for extending tax credits for consumers who take steps such as improving their home energy efficiency.
\
""This Congress needs to renew the clean energy tax credits that will lead to more jobs and less dependence on foreign oil,"" Obama said.
\
He also called for ending billions of dollars in tax subsidies for oil companies.
\
""These are the same oil companies that have been making record profits off the money you spend at the pump for several years,"" Obama said. ""How do they deserve another $4 billion in subsidies from taxpayers? It's outrageous. It's inexcusable.""
\
In another dig at Republican opponents, Obama added that ""every politician who's been fighting to keep these subsidies in place should explain to the American people why the oil industry needs more of their money, especially at a time like this.""

Torrential rain paralyzed recovery efforts Thursday at a Bolivian mining camp where downpours caused a landslide that killed at least 210 people this week.
\
The new rain halted efforts by about 400 volunteers to recover more bodies trapped under tons of rock and sludge at Llipi Limitada gold mining camp in northern Bolivia.
\
So far only 42 bodies have been pulled out from the ruins of the town, where the landslide hit Monday while most people were sleeping. The rest of the victims were still trapped beneath tons of debris.
\
Rescue efforts have been hampered by a lack of heavy machinery, communications breakdowns and lack of food for the volunteers. Reuters

***** TAJIKISTAN Heavily Armed Loyalists Seize Capital
\
Forces loyal to the new government of Tajikistan took control of its capital on Thursday. They were backed by tanks, combat helicopters and armored vehicles.
\
The loyalist troops seized control of key government buildings and industrial sites in Dushanbe. As tanks and armored vehicles rolled through the city, opposition forces retreated into the eastern suburbs, where fierce fighting continued into the afternoon.
\
The action marked the second time in four months that Dushanbe has changed hands in clan-based fighting between a broad alliance backing ousted President Rakhmon Nabiyev and an Islamic-democratic coalition.
\
The civil war has created thousands of refugees. At least 100,000 are said to be stranded in the bitterly cold mountains near the Afghan border. AP

***** SOUTH AFRICA De Klerk, Homeland Bloc Hold Talks

De Klerk said that he, Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Party, Ciskei leader Oupa Gqozo, and Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana had ""succeeded in clearing up a lot of misunderstandings.""
\
The three black leaders said they planned a follow-up meeting of senior aides next month which could include members of white right-wing parties.
\
De Klerk has said he wants to resume formal constitutional talks by March with a view to holding South Africa's first all-race elections early in 1994. Reuters

***** EGYPT Police Round Up Militant Muslims
\
Police swept through a poor district in Cairo on Thursday, again rounding up Muslim militants. The crackdown is Egypt's strongest effort in more than a decade to crush a violent campaign to overthrow the state.
\
Militants threw firebombs at a police car, wounding two officers, and firebombed four video rental shops during the sweep in Imbaba. The district is considered the stronghold of the fundamentalist group.
\
Police said 162 people were arrested overnight and Thursday. They said 573 had been detained since the government launched the crackdown Tuesday. The extremists want to overthrow President Hosni Mubarak's government and replace it with a theocracy. AP

***** NATION IRAQ-GATE Clinton May Reopen Bank Loan Inquiry President-elect Bill Clinton said Thursday that he was not satisfied that all the facts had come to light in the Department of Justice's handling of a controversial Iraqi loan case.
\
He said he would ask his attorney general to look into the matter after he takes office.
\
Clinton's comment appeared to be a tacit slap at a report issued Wednesday by a Department of Justice special investigator, which found no wrongdoing by the department in its investigation of $5 billion in illegal loans to Iraq by the Atlanta branch of Banca Nationale del Lavoro. The report, by former federal judge Frederick B. Lacey, declared no need for further inquiry by an independent counsel.
\
Clinton said Wednesday in Little Rock, Ark., that he would ask his attorney general to re-evaluate the case and advise him whether to seek an investigation by a court-appointed independent counsel. ""I certainly think we need to know more about it than we now know,"" Clinton said. ""And what I intend to do is to appoint an attorney general and then get a recommendation on it.""
\
The statute authorizing an independent counsel expires Tuesday. Clinton said he would support reinstating the statute to handle sensitive cases that might involved high-ranking government officials. LA Times

***** GAS TAX Panel Proposing $1 Hike Over 5 Years
\
A special environmental panel that includes key transition advisers to President-elect Bill Clinton and prospective administration officials is recommending a hefty increase in taxes on gasoline.
\
In a report to be released today, the National Commission on the Environment calls for a gasoline tax increase of more than $1 a gallon over five years to encourage car owners to conserve and to spur a shift to alternative fuels. It also suggested taxing the carbon content of fossil fuels starting at $6 a ton initially and rising to $30 a ton over a five-year period. Reuters-

206,"
The ""E"" in the current federal transportation legislation - called TEA-21 - stands for ""equity."" Missouri officials hope the reauthorization of this law, to take shape in Congress over the next 11 months, lives up to its name.
\
Those who buy gasoline in Missouri send to Washington more fuel-tax money than the state gets back in highway dollars from the federal government.
\
This status as a ""donor state"" rubs wrong members of the congressional delegation and others who oversee the spending of federal transportation dollars in Missouri.
\
Ernie Blazar, spokesman for U.S. Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond, R-Mo., said on the matter of equity, ""That is not only a hope, but that's the senator's goal.""
\
Missourians recognize a fundamental unfairness in this even if not all members of Congress do. Residents of this state pay the same 18.4 cents in federal tax that all Americans do for each gallon of gasoline purchased. Some states, from Hawaii to Maine, get back more than they pay.
\
Defenders, mostly from these ""recipient states,"" say a national transportation program can be run no other way.
\
However, with Missouri's fiscal problems and ailing road system, the state needs every dollar it can manage.
\
The stakes are high. When a presidential signature enacted TEA-21 - the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century - on June 9, 1998, the federal government extended $203 billion for six years of national transportation needs.
\
That kind of money gets attention. Contractor lobbies angle for an even bigger bill, while tax watchdogs worry about pork-barrel spending. Legislators try to get a fair share - or better - for folks back home. The more powerful the lawmaker, the more sticky their grasp.
\
In West Virginia, a ""recipient state"" of the top rank, U.S. Sen. Robert C. Byrd earned his nickname ""Prince of Pork"" by delivering copious amounts of pavement. At one count last year, 20 West Virginia bridges, roads and buildings bore his name, including the Robert C. Byrd Highway.
\
U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, elected this month to a second term representing the northwestern portion of Missouri, doesn't pretend to have such clout but stands in a good position to influence the reauthorization bill.
\
He sits on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, plus the subcommittee on highways and transit. The writing of this legislation, he said, will be one of his top priorities during 2003.
\
""This is the big one,"" he said, noting that hearings have already been held on the legislation. ""I'm pretty excited about what we can do and get back.""
\
Mr. Bond, with his 16 years of seniority, serves on the Committee on Environment and Public Works, along with the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, with a chance to play a prominent role in drafting the legislation.
\
With that chamber changing to a Republican majority, however, the Missourian might shift his committee assignments, moving to the chairmanship of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. An announcement may come Monday, Mr. Blazar said.
\
""He's looking at what's best for the people of Missouri,"" the spokesman said.
\
What it means
\
A St. Joseph driver who uses 15 gallons of gasoline a week sends $143 to the federal government annually. Not all of that money returns from Washington to help Missouri roads.
\
In 2001, for example, those buying gasoline in Missouri paid roughly $544 million in federal motor-fuel tax, plus another $213 million for diesel. Of the $757 million that went to the nation's capital, about $592 million came back.
\
Still, our area benefits from a share of the money.
\
The Consolidated Federal Funds Report reveals that over a five-year period, from the fiscal periods 1997 through 2001, Buchanan County got $12.6 million in highway planning and construction money and another $5.4 million in urban mass transportation and capital improvement- and operating-assistance grants.
\
St. Joseph's bus system gets $800,000 a year in federal operating assistance, and grants originating from federal tax paid at the gas pump went toward building the transit-system headquarters and barn on South Fifth Street and the bus depot on South Sixth Street.
\
Federal gas-tax dollars helped widen Frederick Boulevard from Interstate 29 east, and the St. Joseph hike-and-bike trail took shape with the help of funding from an enhancement portion of the federal Surface Transportation Program.
\
Andrew Clements, the city's assistant director of public works and transportation, said the U.S. Department of Transportation seeks St. Joseph's input on federal legislation as one of the nation's 200 largest metropolitan areas.
\
""Our opinion is usually sought,"" Mr. Clements said. ""We seem to have more influence working through the congressional delegation.""
\
Mr. Clements said the city generally finds favor with TEA-21 and its 1993 predecessor, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, known as ISTEA.
\
""There are a lot of issues on the environmental side and in program delivery, and Congress will take those up,"" he said. ""But they'll be sticking with some of what's best.""
\
Aaron Kincaid, a senior planning technician and federal issues coordinator for the Missouri Department of Transportation, agrees with Mr. Clements' assessment.
\
Referring to One Missouri Position, a coalition of state transportation interests preparing for the reauthorization, Mr. Kincaid said, ""The consensus of the group is that (the legislation) must be an enhancement of TEA-21 and not a major rewrite.""
\
Still, Mr. Kincaid returns to the issue of equity. He said Missouri fared better financially with TEA-21 than with the earlier ISTEA.
\
""We'd hope to build upon that in the next T-bill,"" he said. ""One thing we would hope to see is more dollar-for-dollar return.""

Need new people in power to help city rebound\With the closure of most Shop 'n Save stores, including the 4660 Chippewa Street location, not bought out by Schnucks, it is another example of how St. Louis has gone down as a city.\I was born, went to school and live here, but it's an embarrassment. With businesses closing, crime rates rising and an overall don't-care attitude from city officials, I feel that we're going to be a third-rate city at best.\It is sad because we were a thriving city at one time, but the current regimes in Washington, Jefferson City and City Hall have wrecked our country, our state and our city.\I hope that when people vote on Nov. 6 and in two years from now, they are ticked off enough to care and vote for some new people. That probably won't change anything much either, but it's worth a try.\Michael Chlanda - St. Louis\
Legislature wants to wash its hands of gas-tax increase\Proposition D is a scam. This proposal to raise motor fuel taxes by 10 cents a gallon over the next four years as written is incomprehensible as to all of its provisions and applications.\The wording claims the increased revenue will be $411 million. Is that for each annual 2½-cent increase or the total per year after the fourth increase in 2022? Further wording states that about 70 percent of the new revenue will go to the state road fund and the Highway Patrol. Is this additional funding? Are there new programs contemplated?\The remaining 30 percent generated will be disbursed to local jurisdictions for their road projects. Where does it enumerate what money will go to needed state highway and bridge projects? Stay tuned. That is to be determined.\This proposal is a cynical way for the Legislature to wash its hands of the results. Pass and be deceptively misapplied, or fail; either way, the results are the will of the voters. In any case, not the fault of the members of the Legislature. And those members can continue to say they didn't vote for a tax increase.\A nickel increase in fuel taxes should have been passed five or 10 years ago by the Legislature. The benefits to the state's economy would have been tremendous.\Gary S. Bierman - Brentwood\
Residents should have a say over major changes at county parks\Proposition 2 ensures St. Louis County parks cannot be sold or disposed of without a vote of the people, provides residents a say over major changes in parkland, and does not raise taxes or fees. Laws similar to Proposition 2 are already in place in St. Louis city and several St. Louis County municipalities.\Public parklands are critical to a healthy environment and society. From active recreation to education to meditation, they support a wide array of interests and the personal benefits gained from those activities. From heat sinks to storm water management to noise attenuation and biodiversity banks, they are essential as part of a network of green spaces that provide ecosystem services and keep our community livable.\Speaking of biodiversity, pollinators are essential to our food supply. Bees alone pollinate 75 percent of the fruits, nuts and vegetables in the U.S. Public parkland and green space provide critical habitat for many of the hundreds of varieties of pollinators in our region. Those same trees and other plants that support insect-eating birds and food-pollinating insects also improve water quality, generate oxygen, absorb air pollutants, cool our communities and even provide natural noise barriers.\Politicians, corporations, lobbyists and even civil servants should not be able to sell, dispose of or significantly alter your parks. We think you should have the final say in what happens to them. Vote yes on Charter Amendment Proposition 2.\Mitch Leachman - Maryland Heights

Amendment 1 will increase fairness, accountability\I'm concerned with the false news being spread by opponents of Amendment 1. After careful study, the League of Women Voters of Missouri endorsed this legislative ethics reform measure.\Amendment 1 would ban most lobbyist gifts to legislators, lower campaign contribution limits for legislative races, require that legislative records be open to the public and require a legislator to wait two years before becoming a lobbyist. It would increase fairness, accountability, integrity and transparency in Missouri politics.\Besides reducing the influence of special interest groups in Jefferson City, Amendment 1 would change how legislative districts are drawn after each census to focus on clear criteria instead of incumbency protection. No one should deny that it would be a big improvement over the current system.\Kathleen Boswell - Sedalia, Mo.

Media are correct to push back against Trump's lies\For over two years we have listened to Donald Trump spew false statements over and over on every conceivable topic. These statements have been proven wrong over and over by news sources and fact-checking organizations, yet he keeps saying them and we, the American public, let him get away with it. We talk about it, how it's not true and point to facts that prove it, but then it just ends there.\It's obvious why he does it: to plant that seed of a thought in the minds of his base, who apparently never look up these statements to confirm they are true. So it was so wonderful last week concerning Middle Easterners falsely walking with the migrant caravan to see the media push back and ask the president directly where he is getting his information and if he can prove it is true. He could not.\Let's hold him accountable for the words he says, not just talk about them. To the media, I say keep pushing back by asking him directly what proof he has for his statements. And to his base, I say, ""Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor."" Look it up.\Tom Kiehl - Ladue\> Read more letters online at STLtoday.com/letters"
208," (Information box at end of text)\ The House approved on Thursday a mammoth highway and transit bill that aims to reduce traffic congestion nationwide and bring jobs to every lawmaker's home district.\ The White House said the bill was ""long overdue"" but warned, as the measure moved to the Senate, that it would be subject to a presidential veto if it rose above the $284 billion the House approved.\ The bill, passed 417-9, would guarantee $225.5 billion over a six- year period to the Federal Highway Administration, $52.3 billion to the Federal Transit Administration and more than $6 billion for safety programs.\ It will be ""the signature domestic legislation in this Congress in terms of the positive impact on the economy of this country,"" said Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, a senior Democrat on the House Transportation Committee.\ Congress has been trying to produce a new highway bill since the last six-year plan, funded at $218 billion, expired in September 2003. But the legislation got hung up last year when lawmakers couldn't work out a formula for dividing the money among the states and the White House issued a veto threat over spending levels it said would deepen the federal deficit.\ On Wednesday, the administration applauded the House bill but said President George W. Bush would be advised to veto anything above $284 billion. It issued another veto threat over a clause in the bill requiring that it be reopened in the future, with the intent of adding more money, if goals aren't reached for making disbursement among the states more equitable.\ ""With the opener, we have the opportunity to come back and do this again,"" said Rep. James Oberstar of Minnesota, top Democrat on the Transportation Committee and a leading proponent of more infrastructure spending.\ Currently, states are guaranteed 90.5 cents back for every dollar they contribute through the federal gas tax to the federal highway trust fund. ""Donor"" states that pay more than they get back, many of them in the fast-growing South and Southwest, are demanding a minimum guarantee of 95 percent.\ The House bill would increase the pot of money to be divided among the states by including in the calculations the special projects requested by members.\ Those special projects will be another issue as the bill moves to the Senate. Senators are generally less sympathetic to carving out such ""earmarks"" for members, which fiscal conservatives consider the worst example of pork-barrel spending.\ This time the House included about 4,100 projects, a record, worth an estimated $12.4 billion, according to the fiscal watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. Last-minute changes in the bill benefited Alaska, the home state of committee Chairman Don Young, a Republican. Bridges near Anchorage and Ketchikan, originally funded at $3 million each when the bill was introduced, would get $200 million and $125 million, respectively. Taxpayers for Common Sense said the special projects would be worth an average $1,100 for every Alaskan.\ Young's spokesman, Steve Hansen, said Alaska had half the area of the rest of the United States and, as the nation's newest state, had the most infrastructure needs.\ Funds for an interstate ramp and bridge in Oberstar's district were bumped up from $900,000 in the original bill to $7 million.\ The Senate Environment and Work Force Committee is to take up the highway bill next week. Lawmakers hope to send a compromise measure to the president before the latest temporary extension of the old highway bill expires May 31.\ ---\ Area projects\ Here are some of the major road projects for the St. Louis area included in the transportation bill the House passed Thursday. (While a new Mississippi River bridge at St. Louis is not specified, some money for it is expected to come from a $6 billion pot in the bill for ""megaprojects."")\ The Senate will pass its own version of the bill, which may or may not include these projects. Then, House and Senate negotiators will arrive at a final version to submit for passage later this year.\ MISSOURI\ - $17.18 million for safety improvements to Highway MM in Jefferson County.\ - $11 million for the second phase of a project on Page Avenue in St. Charles County.\ - $10 million for upgrades on Hanley Road in St. Louis County.\ - $10 million for an I-55/Weber Road interchange.\ - $7 million for improvements to Tucker Boulevard in St. Louis.\ - $5 million for safety improvements to Highway 21 in Jefferson County.\ - $4.82 million to improve roads around and access to the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis.\ - $3.5 million to remove and replace the Grand Boulevard viaduct in St. Louis.\ - $2 million for improvements to I-270 and Dorsett Road in St. Louis County.\ - $2 million for improvements to I-170 and Scudder Road in St. Louis County.\ ILLINOIS\ - $6.5 million to improve North Illinois Street in Belleville.\ - $6 million to build a connector between Collinsville Road and Route 3/North 1st Street in St. Clair County.\ - $2.9 million for improvements to State Street between 43rd Street and Route 157 in East St. Louis.\ - $2.8 million to extend Frank Scott Parkway East Road to Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County.\ - $2 million to widen Old Madison Road in St. Clair County.\ - $1.75 million for improvements to Route 159 in Collinsville.\ - $1.7 million to build part of a 230-mile corridor from I-280 in Rock Island, Ill., to I-270 south of Alton.\ - $1.6 million to build an entry road into the Southern Illinois University Research Park in Carbondale.\ Sources: House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the offices of Reps.

ELECTION ""96
\
Gov. Mel Carnahan outpolled President Bill Clinton on Tuesday in what appeared to be a historic Democratic sweep of Missouri statewide offices.
\
Carnahan's coattails may well have carried two of his struggling cohorts, Lt. Gov. Roger Wilson and Secretary of State Bekki Cook. Wilson's Republican opponent, state Sen. Bill Kenney, was conceding. Cook and her GOP challenger, John Hancock of St. Louis, were locked in the state's tightest contest after setting campaign spending records.
\
Flashing a rare smile, Carnahan told revelers late Tuesday that his strong re-election showing ""vindicated us, particularly on the issue of education reform.""
\
State Auditor Margaret Kelly, the GOP nominee, had pounded at Carnahan's $310 million tax increase, pushed through the Legislature in 1993. The state Republican Party did the same in a heavy anti-Carnahan ad campaign, launched last spring and resurrected in recent weeks.
\
Even so, almost six of every 10 Missouri voters opted to stick with Carnahan - compared to fewer than half who supported Clinton for president.
\
State Treasurer Bob Holden, who easily won re-election and hinted he may run for governor when Carnahan retires in four years, said the overall Democratic sweep was ""a mandate from the people of Missouri that they want positive leadership in the state.""
\
Holden defeated Carl Bearden of St. Charles. Attorney General Jay Nixon, another potential contender for governor, handily defeated Kansas City lawyer Mark Bredemeier.
\
Tuesday's re-election victories by the state's five statewide Democratic incumbents marked the first time in Missouri history that voters had opted to retain a full Democratic slate.
\
The success affirmed the state Democratic Party's resurgence, after a decade of Republican dominance in the 1980s.
\
""Not a better time for it to happen than the last election before the millennium,"" said Rada Martin, one of hundreds of Democratic celebrants at the party's victory bash at the Adam's Mark Hotel downtown.
\
When early returns offered a hint of the Democratic wins, entertainers stormed the stage and launched into a rousing rendition of ""Dancing in the Streets.""
\
Kelly Vows To Help
\
After calling Carnahan a liar for weeks, Kelly opted for a conciliatory tone in her concession speech, delivered before a small group of supporters at Jefferson City's Capitol Plaza Hotel.
\
Wearing a bright blue suit and a broad smile, Kelly put the best face on the results. Flanked by her husband and son, Kelly said, ""the voters have spoken, and they have voted to retain Mel Carnahan as governor and Margaret Kelly as state auditor.""
\
She offered to ""assist him in any way we can.""
\
Kelly had hinged her election chances on her promise to cut taxes by $640 million a year.
\
While Kelly declined to analyze her defeat, campaign consultant Weldon Tuck observed: ""It was not the proper political environment, generally speaking, for Republicans, and we could've used a little bit more cash.""
\
Kelly and Carnahan's advisers praised her decision to key in on taxes, and to run a condensed, six-week campaign.
\
Tuck, who has managed Kelly's last four campaigns, said surveys show she enjoys a high job-approval rating among voters.
\
""Margaret can be auditor forever, if she wants,"" he said.
\
Kelly declined to discuss her political future. Her immediate plans center on going to Chicago. A new grandbaby is due any day.
\
Carnahan's victory came close to the record margin of 1988, when then-Gov. John Ashcroft, a Republican, garnered 62 percent of the vote in his re-election win over Democrat Betty Hearnes.
\
Combined, Carnahan and Kelly spent less than $5 million for their campaigns - a quarter of 1992's record-setting spending for governor by five major candidates.
\
This year's lower spending is tied, in part, to the state's campaign-contribution limits put in place in 1995. However, Democrats and Republicans say the reduction in lower candidate spending has been largely offset by an explosion in spending by independent groups on behalf of favored candidates.
\
How much was spent by such groups may be impossible to track, candidates say.
\
Tightest Contests
\
The battles for lieutenant governor and secretary of state had been by far the most heated.
\
Wilson, savoring his victory, said little. ""There's nothing I hate worse than a poor winner."" Referring to his opponent, Wilson added, ""We both have a responsibility to 5.2 milion Missourians and we're going to fulfill it.""
\
Kenney's final campaign push - attempting to link Wilson with indicted former House Speaker Bob Griffin - may have backfired.
\
In a news release Friday, Kenney implied that Wilson got $20,000 in campaign contributions from Griffin for helping pass a gas tax in 1992. Kenney said Wilson's committee handled the tax. In fact, it did not. Also, federal prosecutors had cautioned against implicating politicians who were not indicted.
\
In the race for secretary of state, a campaign characterized by a fund-raising frenzy ended in the closest contest in Missouri. Cook declined to be interviewed until she was certain that she had won.
\
Hancock, meanwhile, declined to concede defeat when returns continued to show him trailing. ""It's going to be tight,"" he said, as he paced the floor of his campaign headquarters in the basement of his home just north of Creve Coeur. ""It's going to be real tight.""
\
Hancock remained optimistic as results trickled in. His victory strategy hinged on winning counties in southwest Missouri and Kansas City and surrounding areas.
\
""It could go either way,"" Hancock said.
\
If Hancock loses, he will not run again. ""I've got three other people to provide for,"" he said referring to his wife, Georgeann, the baby they're expecting December and his 2-year-old son.
\
""It's scary to think that what happens tonight dictates not only the next four years of your life, but the next 30 years of your life,"" he said. ""It's kind of a sobering thought to have that much riding on one night.""
\
Hancock, a former state legislator and marketing consultant, said the only tough financial years he has had were in 1992, when he lost his first bid for secretary and state, and this year, when he ran again for that office.
"
210,"There is a lot on the ballot on Nov. 6, and we've been digging in on these issues to figure out what we think is best for Missouri. Here's our take on the six biggest ballot initiatives.\With three competing initiatives on the ballot, this might be the most challenging issue for voters to sort out.\A 2014 study showed an average decline in opioid overdoses of 24.8 percent in states that had passed medical marijuana laws. A study in April of this year showed a decrease in opioid prescriptions of 14.4 percent in states that have legalized it as well. Missouri ranks 19th in the country for opioid deaths, and medical marijuana offers an alternative approach for some patients with significantly less risk than continued use of opioids.\Because of this, we are in favor of legalizing medical marijuana for Missouri. We think there is a clear distinction between the proposals, with Amendment 2 offering the best option for Missourians.\Amendment 2 will legalize medical marijuana for a select number of medical conditions, with ample options for cultivation and dispensary licenses to avoid headaches like those Arkansas is currently experiencing with its medical marijuana situation. It offers a low tax rate to keep in line with the majority of states that have legalized it, with tax rates ranging from none to 7 percent for almost all of them.\This approach also would put the regulation of medical marijuana under the oversight of the state Department of Health and Senior Services, ensuring transparency and accountability for how it is implemented and maintained going forward.\The thoughtful, patient-focused approach of Amendment 2 has won our support as the best option on the ballot.\Proposition C offers a similar proposal to Amendment 2. Our concern is that Proposition C is vulnerable to being gutted by the legislature in opposition to the voice of the people, since it is not a constitutional amendment. The extra protections provided by this difference lead us to support Amendment 2 as a better option than Proposition C, but we endorse a yes vote on C as well to offer the best chance of success for medical marijuana being legalized in November.\Amendment 3 is the outlier of this group. It offers the highest tax rate of the 3 proposals, while also establishing what would amount to a new branch of government, with no oversight from the legislative or executive branches. The potential for abuse through unchecked use of eminent domain to seize land for a research campus and bonding authority to issue debt as proposed in the full text of the initiative are too significant to ignore. With an estimated $66 million dollars raised annually through this proposal, there needs to be strong oversight – and none is provided for in this amendment. Despite our support of legalizing medical marijuana, we can not endorse Amendment 3 as a beneficial approach to doing so.\The Clean Missouri amendment aims to tackle inequities in the current political environment in Missouri. It is a strong effort to limit the effect of dark money and lobbyist money on the legislative process.\The redistricting effort is the more controversial aspect of this proposal. It is a complicated mechanism, but it is also designed to be a transparent one. All data will be subject to the Sunshine Law – which it currently is not. It is not a perfect method, but it is an improvement over what we currently have and offers a mechanism to keep track of how the work of redistricting is being done. If complications develop, this will allow voters to make an educated choice to improve this process in the future.\We endorse Amendment 1 as a strong step forward for the voice of all Missourians.\Addressing low wages in southwest Missouri has long been an issue of interest for the News-Leader editorial board. Poverty rates in the area are startling. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, Springfield has a poverty rate of 25.9 percent.\Branson is 20.9 percent. Joplin, 18.5 percent. Bolivar, 20.9 percent. Monett, 28.9 percent. West Plains, 27.7 percent.\Raising the minimum wage will not eliminate poverty, but it will be a significant step toward lessening it. Studies have estimated that 25 percent of Missouri workers would see their wages rise with a higher minimum wage. In Greene County alone, more than 40,000 workers would see their wages rise through this measure.\And this benefit a wide cross-section of Missourians. Minimum wage is not something that is limited to just high schoolers working at McDonald's. It is prevalent in home health care, babysitting, janitorial work and more – people working hard to support their families and having to work more than one job just to have a chance at rising above the poverty line, let alone a living wage.\Businesses will feel a pinch with the higher wages. But the money spent will be turned right back around into the economy, raising revenues for those companies to help offset the higher cost. Despite that higher cost, more than 300 business across Missouri have come out to publicly support this initiative, including local businesses like the Vecino Group, Hoover Music Company, Mud House Coffee and Bambino's.\The benefits to Missourians far outstrip the cost, and we endorse this initiative to improve the lives of so many across the state.\Missouri's roads are critical to our economic success.\Our state has the 7th largest highway system in the country but has the 49th lowest gas tax. To stay competitive with other states and take advantage of our central location, our roads need to be maintained and improved. And that takes money.\The language of the bill may be a bit confusing, but here's what it does: Currently, a large portion of the current fuel tax goes to fund state law enforcement. The money from this tax increase will be specifically directed to fund state law enforcement, freeing up those funds previously spent on law enforcement to be applied to road maintenance and improvements as directed by the Missouri constitution. Constitutionally, that money will have 30 percent of it dedicated to local road efforts which – based on best estimates – will work out to $123 million per year in additional funding for local roads across the state.\The tax will be phased in over time in 2.5 cent increments. Once it is fully implemented, the estimated cost to consumers will average $5/mo or $60/year. This is a small price to pay to improve our roads and keep us all safe when driving on them.\Taxes are not inherently good or bad; each must be evaluated for the benefits to the state, the cost to the public for those benefits, and the stewardship shown in executing it. MoDOT has been excellent in maximizing their funding over the years and have shown themselves to be good stewards of public money. We strongly endorse this tax for the benefit of all Missourians.\People vote at Woodland Heights Presbyterian Church in Springfield on Nov. 8, 2016.\News-Leader File Photo"

Attorney General Jay Nixon and Treasurer Bob Holden, both Democrats, easily won re-election.
\
Flashing a rare smile, Carnahan told revelers late Tuesday that his strong re-election showing ""vindicated us, particularly on the issue of education reform.""
\
State Auditor Margaret Kelly, the GOP nominee, had pounded at Carnahan's $310 million tax increase, pushed through the Legislature in 1993 to provide more money for education. The state Republican Party did the same in a heavy anti-Carnahan ad campaign, launched last spring and resurrected in recent weeks.
\
Even so, almost six of every 10 Missouri voters opted to stick with Carnahan - compared to fewer than half who supported Clinton for president.
\
Treasurer Holden hinted he may run for governor when Carnahan retires in four years, said the overall Democratic sweep was ""a mandate from the people of Missouri that they want positive leadership in the state.""
\
Holden defeated Carl Bearden of St. Charles. Attorney General Nixon, another potential contender for governor, handily defeated Kansas City lawyer Mark Bredemeier.
\
Tuesday's re-election victories by the state's five statewide Democratic incumbents marked the first time in Missouri history that voters had opted to retain a full Democratic slate. The success affirmed the state Democratic Party's resurgence, after a decade of Republican dominance in the 1980s.
\
""Not a better time for it to happen than the last election before the millennium,"" said Rada Martin, one of hundreds of Democratic celebrants at the party's victory bash at the Adam's Mark Hotel downtown.
\
With early returns hinting the Democratic wins, entertainers stormed the stage and launched into a rousing rendition of ""Dancing in the Streets.""
\
Kelly Vows To Help
\
After calling Carnahan a liar for weeks, Kelly opted for a conciliatory tone in her concession speech, delivered before a small group of supporters at Jefferson City's Capitol Plaza Hotel.
\
Wearing a bright blue suit and a broad smile, Kelly put the best face on the results. Flanked by her husband and son, Kelly said, ""The voters have spoken, and they have voted to retain Mel Carnahan as governor and Margaret Kelly as state auditor.""
\
She offered to ""assist him in any way we can.""
\
Kelly had hinged her election chances on her promise to cut taxes by $640 million a year.
\
While Kelly declined to analyze her defeat, campaign consultant Weldon Tuck observed: ""It was not the proper political environment, generally speaking, for Republicans, and we could've used a little bit more cash.""
\
Kelly and Carnahan's advisers praised her decision to key in on the governor's tax hike, and to run a condensed, six-week campaign. Her problem, said Carnahan campaign manager Roy Temple, was that she failed to sell voters on her own tax-cut plan.
\
Tuck, who has managed Kelly's last four campaigns, said surveys show she enjoys a high job-approval rating among voters.
\
""Margaret can be auditor forever, if she wants,"" he said.
\
Kelly declined to discuss her political future. Her immediate plans center on going to Chicago. A new grandbaby is due any day.
\
Carnahan's victory came close to the record margin of 1988, when then-Gov. John Ashcroft, a Republican, garnered 62 percent of the vote in his re-election win over Democrat Betty Hearnes.
\
The battles for lieutenant governor and secretary of state had been by far the most heated.
\
Tightest Contests
\
Although lieutenant governor is typically a low-profile job, the race for the office was anything but. Challenger Kenney, a former quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs, got help in his tough campaign from House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. and other prominent Republicans
\
When Kenney called Wilson to concede defeat, he also called for a truce.
\
Wilson also is a future gubernatorial candidate. He said Tuesday that although he was tempted to stay angry about the nasty campaign with Kenney, ""There's nothing I hate worse than a poor winner.""
\
""We both have a responsibility to 5.2 million Missourians, and we're going to fulfill it.""
\
Kenney's final campaign push - attempting to link Wilson with indicted former House Speaker Bob Griffin - may have backfired. In a news release Friday, Kenney implied that Wilson got $20,000 in campaign contributions from Griffin for helping pass a gas tax in 1992. Kenney said Wilson's committee handled the tax. In fact, it did not. Also, federal prosecutors had cautioned against implicating politicians who were not indicted.
\
In the race for secretary of state, a campaign characterized by a fund-raising frenzy ended in the closest contest in Missouri. At 12:40 a.m. today, Hancock finally called Cook to concede. In an interview a few minutes earlier, Cook said, ""I feel pretty secure. It wasn't as close as in '92. That's what I was aiming for.""
\
In 1992, Cook wasn't the Democratic nominee. It was Judith Moriarty, who also narrowly defeated Hancock. In late 1994, Moriarty was impeached for wrongdoing. Carnahan appointed Cook, a Cape Girardeau lawyer, to take Moriarty's place.
\
A few days later, Cook presided over the state House vote for speaker. By allowing the legislators to vote for three hours, she helped then-incumb ent Griffin to stave off an attempted GOP coup. That action was the centrpiece of Hancock's ad campaign against Cook.
\
Hancock, a former state legislator who runs his own marketing business, spent much of Tuesday evening pacing the floor of his campaign headquarters in the basement of his home just north of Creve Coeur.
\
Hancock says he won't run for office again, although he plans to stay involved in politics. ""I've got three other people to provide for,"" he said referring to his wife, Georgeann, the baby they're expecting December and his 2-year-old son.

BOLIVAR - Dressed in socks, a John Deere sweatshirt and blue jeans, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson gazed out of a window of his rural Polk County home Saturday.\Pointing to two flag poles in the rain-soaked backyard, the 62-year-old Republican said he dug the holes and set them in concrete the previous weekend while he was on a break from his duties as chief executive in the Capitol City.\And that was in between tending to a herd of about 100 cattle spread across the pasture surrounding his house.\""It's a good getaway for me. It's good therapy. I can get out here and be alone,"" Parson told the Post-Dispatch in a wide-ranging interview at his home.\Parson, who marked his 100th day in office Sunday, said the transition from lieutenant governor to the state's top elected office after the stunning resignation of scandal-plagued former Gov. Eric Greitens has been a whirlwind.\""Man, you give up a lot on the family side. That's just the reality of it,"" said Parson, who was sworn in June 1. ""It's a change in your lifestyle. We're just now starting to get a rhythm.""\Asked what he's found most surprising about his new job, Parson said, ""I think the demands of the job. The serious nature of the job.""\""You're now the guy whose job is to get it right,"" he said.\Parson, who turns 63 next week, said he was moving his cattle when the phone call came announcing that Greitens was on his way out. Although the potential of him ascending to the top spot had been percolating for months as Greitens faced the possibility of a criminal conviction or impeachment, the moment still came as a shock.\He and his wife, Teresa, had just moved into their new house. There were still things to be done to make it a home, like erecting the flag poles.\""We lived here about 30 days and we got the call to go to Jefferson City,"" Parson said.\STARTING CONVERSATIONS\Parson was near one of his barns, surrounded by cows, when he learned Greitens had pulled the plug after 17 tumultuous months in office. Parson turned down an offer to be picked up by the governor's security detail. That, he said, would give him and his wife time to discuss the transition on the two-hour car ride to Jefferson City.\From there, he has set about trying to reverse the often combative, confrontational course set by his predecessor. He removed the electronic lock that the notoriously media-averse Greitens had installed on the door to the governor's press office. Now, on most days, the door is open to the public.\""I really want to make an effort to be transparent. I really want to do that,"" he said.\Parson also has held numerous meetings with mayors, county officials and lawmakers, many of whom had felt largely shut out of the decision-making process under the former administration. And, he kept most of Greitens' agency heads on board.\In his first 100 days, Parson has spent a lot of time listening. He's made treks to Kansas City and St. Louis, hoping to bridge the urban and rural divide in Missouri, and he's promoted the idea of workforce development, a catch-all phrase for making sure young Missourians are ready for the jobs that await them.\""We've got a chance of really making Missouri a better place,"" Parson said.\He's also gotten solidly behind a proposed gas tax increase, pitching it as a way to improve the state's highways and create construction industry jobs.\In November, voters will be asked to weigh in on a phased-in 10-cent increase in the state's 17-cent per gallon motor fuel tax. It would be the first boost since the Legislature approved a 6-cent increase in 1992.\""That will change Missouri for the future, dramatically,"" Parson said.\Rep. Phil Christofanelli, R-St. Peters, is among those who said Greitens' exodus released pressure that had been building under the Capitol dome since news broke in January that the former governor had an extramarital affair in 2015.\""There's no doubt about it that the early part of this year was a sad and trying time for our state. It was a time when emotions were pretty high,"" Christofanelli said. ""From that perspective, the fact that that environment has changed has certainly been a relief in my eyes. It was a bad situation, no matter what perspective you were looking at it from.""\Christofanelli said Parson's approach to lawmakers also is different than Greitens.\""Parson has been the one to initiate the conversations,"" Christofanelli said.\Thus far, he's met with the governor twice, talking tax policy and education.\""It's given me the opportunity to know him better,"" Christofanelli said. ""He's struck me as open-minded. I found that reassuring.""\GRAPPLING WITH THE LEGISLATURE\While the new governor has received high marks for smoothing out what had become a turbulent time in state government, he has rubbed some lawmakers the wrong way.\In signing the state's $28.65 billion state budget, Parson used his line-item veto power to cancel 21 separate provisions totaling more than $12 million.\Among them were a $100,000 to the Child Advocate Office, $50,000 to buy tourniquets for police departments and $153,000 to certify hospitals to treat trauma, stroke and heart attack patients.\Cutting money for the tourniquets drew bipartisan scorn. Supporters said they would be used to stop bleeding from injuries sustained by both officers and members of the public.\But Parson, a former member of the House and Senate and a former Polk County sheriff, said buying items like tourniquets should be left to local governments to decide. He said if the state begins mandating items like tourniquets, it could lead to other spending requirements on equipment, such as bullet proof vests.\Parson also vetoed legislation that dealt with drug treatment courts, saying the measure included multiple subjects, a violation of the Constitution.\He also vetoed a proposal aimed at boosting computer science among Missouri's high school students by allowing high school computer science courses to count toward math, science or practical art credits needed for graduation.\On Monday, rather than face override votes by the Legislature when they return to town for their annual veto session, Parson has called them into a special session aimed at fixing the problems with both pieces of legislation.\It will be his first real test in grappling with members of the Legislature.\""For us, this is the first time all of the legislators are going to be there. All of them have some concerns or something going on that they want to talk about. We're trying to figure out how the week is going to flow,"" Parson said.\""Hopefully it will go pretty smoothly. But I've been in the Senate so I'm reluctant to say anything is a done deal,"" Parson said.\CREDIT: By Kurt Erickson, St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
213,"Reject legislators who reject aid\Regarding ""Missouri alone in rejecting jobless aid"" (April 1): Are Missouri legislators less intelligent and less compassionate than other state legislators? \While the hearts of others go out to the unemployed and their families, these folks turn their heads away from those who are suffering. What's a no-brainer to others seems to baffle our elected representatives. Do they really believe that out-of-work folks could get jobs if they wanted to? Obviously, the Republican legislators who rejected the federal money to extend unemployment benefits have not had to face this problem in their own families. Do they think those who have jobs are superior, smarter, better than those who have lost their jobs? Do they think they are throwing a huge dart at President Barack Obama? \I guess we'll just have to reject them when they come looking for our votes.\Joanne Kelly Good - Maplewood President, Womens' Voices Raised for Social Justice\Missouri won't collapse\If Sen. Jim Lembke, R-South County, and three other senators prevent Missouri from extending unemployment benefits and it angers Republican leaders in the Senate, the leadership will come down on them. But to say in the editorial ""Up in smoke"" (March 30) that extending the benefits won't cost Missouri anything is false. The treasury will have to be repaid.\The editorial surmised that much of the $105 million would have been spent on food. But that is the same reasoning that led President Barack Obama to add $3 trillion to the nation's debt.\Missouri is a state rich in churches and charity. Missouri will not collapse because of ballyhooing.\To make an issue over a few bottles of Missouri wine and money clips of little value is far below journalism.\Bud Gilberg - Affton\Taking revenue \I find it difficult to believe that residents of Sen. Jim Lembke's district, a struggling community on the lower end of middle class, would vote for a person such as Mr. Lembke, who said he is opposed to extending the unemployment benefits because he wants to send a message to Washington ""to stop the spending.""\I would be curious to see Mr. Lembke's tax return to see if he puts his money where his mouth is by not taking the tax deductions to which he may be entitled. Mr. Lembke may not know it, but those deductions have the same effect on the budget as spending. \Mr. Lembke may not have a clear understanding of his role as a state senator. A senator is elected to serve the best interests of the residents of his district and the best interests of the state. But his position on the unemployment benefit extension fails to serve his district or the state. He would deny residents a much-needed direct federal cash payment and reduce business revenue by more than $200 million.\Mr. Lembke may find reelection difficult when his business supporters learn that he took an opportunity for increased revenue from their cash registers.\Gary Alan - St. Louis\Missouri first\As a long-term resident of Missouri, I take note of our efforts to lead in many areas. For example, we consistently are in the bottom three states when it comes to funding higher education; our gas tax and resulting highway construction and maintenance are among the poorest in the nation. But good news from Jefferson City: We are officially the only state in the union to reject the federal unemployment benefits extension, removing $105 million from the state's economy by choice.\Now we are the undisputed leaders in having the dumbest Legislature in the country. Congratulations, fellow Missourians.\Paul Speckman - Columbia, Mo.\Make everyone happy\State Sen. Jim Lembke, R-South County, should remember that the extension of unemployment benefits to the Missouri unemployed was part of a compromise reached with both political parties in Congress pertaining to the extension of the Bush tax cuts.\If he and the other three senators in the Missouri Senate do not want to abide by that compromise regarding unemployed workers, they should tell their richest constituents that their taxes will be raised concurrent to this refusal of the federal unemployment money.\While we're at it, we can get rid of those costly federal farm subsidies, too. That should make everyone happy. \Jim Paunovich - Calverton Park \Worse economy\""Missouri alone in rejecting jobless aid"" (April 1) made it seem that it is a matter of opinion that the state's economy will suffer. You don't have to be an economist to conclude that less money flowing into the economy will have negative consequences. People without income can't buy products or go out to eat, etc. \Less money equals a worse economy. That is not an opinion; it is a fact.\Mark Talarico - Wentzville\Dishonest billing \Regarding ""Hospital pricing structure targeted"" (March 26): The policy of SSM Hospitals in St. Louis of gouging patients is reprehensible and dishonest. The hospital threatened to sue a patient for payment of an unreasonable sum, $40,308 for an overnight stay and treatment. Someone other than a physician would find it impossible to decode such bills. \Other than the lawsuit, other remedies should be investigated to halt such practices: Dismiss the CEO who is numb to ordinary medical billing practices and basic fairness and honesty. Investigate how such practices justify the tax-exempt status of SSM. \Also, who was the physician noted in the article who charged $4,200 for a colonoscopy, a price 976 percent more than the Medicare reimbursement rate of $430?\The Missouri Medical Association, individual physicians and the Missouri Legislature should determine a course of action to end such practices on the part of all health care providers.\I hope this is just the beginning salvo on the part of reporter Jim Doyle to inform us about dishonest billing practices.\Dr. Roman Patrick - St. Louis County\In a brass band\Leonard Pitts Jr. is correct in arguing that basic human rights should not be subjected to the fluctuating verdicts of opinion polls (""Gay marriage is a right, not a poll question ,"" March 27). But is he correct in claiming that same-sex ""marriage"" is a basic human right?\If it were, how could this ""right"" have remained unknown to the entire human race from the dawn of civilization until just a few years ago? Slaves throughout history detested their condition, believing in their right to freedom; similarly, followers of every religion always believed in their right to freedom of worship. \But gays and lesbians didn't think they had a basic right to marry their partners until about 20 years ago. Before that, homosexuals wished that society would accept their lifestyle. Perhaps, like everyone else, they understood that marriage is, by definition, a man-woman institution arising from two unchangeable facts of nature: children come from male-female unions and children generally develop their human potential best when raised in a stable home environment with their biological parents.\Refusing to legalize gay ""marriage"" is no more unjust or ""discriminatory"" than refusing to admit violinists to play in a brass band.\The Rev. Brian W. Harrison - St. Louis\Teachers or trains?\The March 30 paper had the following headlines: ""Half of E. St. Louis teachers get layoff notices"" and ""Missouri pursues $1 billion for train upgrades, study on high-speed rail."" Where are our priorities?\Jim Ostle - Collinsville"
214,"ST. LOUIS COUNTY Note: a shorter version of this story appeared in Zone West.\Representatives of the St. Louis County Municipal League have told the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council to forget the Page Avenue extension and use the money to fix other roads and bridges and build more mass transit.\Instead of encouraging urban sprawl, East-West Gateway should encourage ""smart growth"" by using current roads and giving motorists alternatives in the form of mass transit and passenger rail, the municipal officials said.\The officials and other speakers used the last in a series of public hearings by East-West Gateway on the topic of spending federal transportation money to urge the agency to scrap the Page Avenue extension and concentrate on other transportation needs in the St. Louis area.\The project would extend Page from St. Louis County across a new bridge over the Missouri River into St. Charles County. A section of the road would cut through Creve Coeur Park with a bridge over part of the lake. Environmentalists fear the road will damage the park.\Mike Swoboda, a Kirkwood councilman and president of the St. Louis County Municipal League, charged that construction of the Page Avenue extension violated the principles of East-West Gateway's long-range plan, which includes preservation and safety as its top priorities.\""I do not see how we can honestly say that preservation is a priority and then turn around and commit $70 million per year to one single expansion project while our built system is decaying,"" he said.\He noted that East-West Gateway's plan, titled ""Transportation Redefined,"" says that ""deferring maintenance by even three or four years can add four or five times to the cost of repairs.""\Joe Adams, mayor of University City and chairman of the municipal league's Transportation Committee, said the Page project would ""shift our assets outward, creating an even larger hole in the middle of the region. Even if all the arguments about destroying the lake, further congesting I-270 and the huge pricetag jumping to $70 million per year all went away, we are left with one undeniable problem: the costly shift of the middle class to their jobs and the tax base to areas where we are building on fields and forest for no good reason.""\He noted that with the recent opening of Highway 370, the widening of Interstate 64 (Highway 40) and the Page Avenue extension there would be 32 expressway lanes between St. Louis County and St. Charles County. ""Yet today there are only 28 freeway lanes between St. Louis County and St. Louis City,"" he said. ""This tells us that outward growth is more important than preservation.""\Robert Brauss, a resident of Baden, said the state was spending ""a billion dollars to shift traffic jams"" and added that Interstate 270 would be unable to handle more traffic from the Page Avenue extension.\Brauss said he was concerned that the state ""refuses to include inflation and the cost of upgrading connecting roads when estimating Page's cost.""\The state said earlier that the project would cost $500,000.\""More inclusive estimates place the cost at $1 billion or $70 million a year for 14 years,"" or about one-third of St. Louis County's share of state money for roads and 25 percent of the region's money, Brauss said.\Tim Fischesser, executive director of the municipal league, said he was disturbed by reports that if the state scrapped the Page project, the money for it could not be used for other projects in the area.\Les Sterman, executive director of East-West Gateway, said, ""I would hope it (the money) would stay in the region, but it is difficult to say. We haven't had a circumstance where a major project has been withdrawn.""\He said the choice of a new project probably would be the decision of East-West Gateway, but he added that the ""memorandum of understanding"" between East-West Gateway and the state ""does not have the force of law.""\Former Webster Groves Mayor Terri Williams suggested that because the Interstate 64 (Highway 40) bridge over the Missouri River ""will probably be replaced in the not too distant future,"" East-West Gateway should consider scrapping the Page Avenue Extension and widening Interstate 64 (Highway 40). Although this would mean fewer lanes than the Page Avenue extension, it would ""be more in line with the number of lanes proposed to voters in 1988 when we approved the first gas-tax increase"" and would result in less sprawl, she said.\Lisa Van Amburg, a lawyer from St. Louis, told East-West Gateway she was concerned about the environment and ""what product are we getting for our dollar. It's still an astronomical amount of money proportionately to the dollars available to the St. Louis area for transportation.""\""I don't see history proving we are able to build our way out of congestion,"" said Van Amburg, adding that recently, when she was crossing an overpass over Interstate 270, that road was ""bumper-to-bumper cars, one person in each car.""\""It was quite a sight to see,"" she said. ""I can't believe that all of that money is going to help that problem.""\State Rep. Joan Bray, D-University City, told East-West Gateway that it should be spending money on fixing roads and bridges.\""We keep creating more that we won't maintain, and that is a big mistake,"" she said. ""We have such decrepit infrastructure and roads that safety becomes a major issue.""\She noted that motorists were adaptable and found alternate routes when necessary.\Bray said transportation money should be used for mass transit. ""Let's not always tax ourselves more to build public transportation,"" she said. ""Let's use the money we already have before we tax ourselves.""\Bray also urged East-West Gateway to spend more money on passenger rail. Train service between St. Louis and Kansas City has seen a recent increase of 19 percent in passengers, she says.\Earlier similar meetings held in an open-house format drew sparse turnouts except for one in St. Charles, where more than 100 people came, mostly to support the plan to extend Page, says Jim Wild of East-West Gateway.\In the open-house format, visitors have conversations with officials or have the option of presenting written comments. The final meeting last week included a segment in the traditional public-hearing format with speakers addressing officials.\Fischesser says his organization had requested that the final hour of the last open house be in the traditional format ""so people could stand up, make public comment and ask questions so the audience could react a little more. So often with the private conversation, you're limited to what you happen to think of. But in this format, it's subject to more comments, and everybody has a chance to talk and respond.""\His organization made the request because several of its members had attended the open houses and ""felt that they were kind of disjointed. You couldn't get questions to people you wanted because they were busy, and they thought they would learn more by a public-comment, more formal public hearing.""\Gary Elmestad representing St. Charles County was the only speaker in favor of the extension. He said others, including elected officials, would have attended ""if they had known this was going to be a public format."" He said the fact that the meeting was in the afternoon and evening of an election night also affected attendance.\""It's disappointing to see some of the region's attacks on the transportation plan that has gone through a very difficult process,"" he said. ""We've been real careful in St. Charles County not to criticize other projects.""\Elmestad also said that St. Charles County's rejection of MetroLink reflected the people's feelings. ""I want to remind everybody that MetroLink was also voted down in St. Louis County and in Madison County in Illinois,"" he said. ""It's very difficult for elected officials to go against their constituency."""
215," Nursing Home Negligence\ The July 13 article about the care problems at Chesterfield Manor and the state's effort to fine the facility for the neglectful death of a resident failed to emphasize the significance of this case for Missouri's citizens.\ It is important to understand that 15 to 20 percent of Missouri's nursing homes do not provide adequate care to their residents but reap enormous profits. These negligent homes are primarily operated for profit by out-of-state owners or operators.\ Missouri regulations are very weak in the area of staffing requirements and the nursing home industry lobbyists are very powerful. Until the Missouri Coalition for Quality Care recently became active, the industry had free rein over setting public policy related to rules and Medicaid reimbursement.\ The case at Chesterfield Manor sets a precedent. It is the first time that the law introduced by state Rep. Lana Stokan has been used to fine a facility for a transgression.\ Since 1979 when Missouri's Nursing Home Reform Act was enacted there has been a fining provision, but the language was flawed. Until Stokan's bill was passed in 1995, the nursing home industry had successfully defeated three attempts to correct the language regarding civil penalties. Due to her persistence and the support of citizens throughout the state, the bill was passed.\ The industry then filed suit to declare the bill unconstitutional, a step calculated to delay or defeat the process.\ The Missouri Coalition for Quality Care, a non-profit grassroots advocacy organization serving older, disabled people and their families dealing with long-term care, joined the American Association of Retired Persons last fall and filed an amicus (friend of the court) brief with the circuit court judge outlining the reasons, from a citizen's perspective, why the bill is so important. In March, the judge ruled in favor of the people.\ The industry needs to understand that if facilities provide appropriate care, they have nothing to fear from the new law.\ Our group urges the legal section of the Department of Social Services to study the language in the law and, in the future, immediately file a civil penalty at the time the event is validated. The whole point of this new provision is to emphasize that a facility can never correct a death or serious injury no matter what is done to prevent it from happening in the future.\ Joanne Polowy\ Executive Director\ Missouri Coalition for Quality Care\ Jefferson City\ Violette King's July 15 letter appeared a day after a local radio station had an open-line program dedicated to nursing home care. The guest was Jerry Simon, director of the Division of Aging, who carefully explained how his division inspected nursing homes, unannounced, and responded to complaints from residents or their representatives.\ As the son of an aged parent in a nursing home, I was dismayed to hear that someone with his level of responsibility is so naive or ignorant about what goes on in a nursing home and in the division he supervises.\ Numerous callers, including nursing home staff, cited cases of incompetent help and unaccountable administration that lead to stealing and improper medication, feeding and personal hygiene. Awareness of an upcoming inspection is quite common.\ Basic accountability is as lacking in regulators as it is in some nursing homes. New laws to protect the ""cash crop for the very wealthy and powerful industry"" are needed, providing enforcement does not degenerate t o the current level.\ The Post-Dispatch should expose the cozy relationship between governmental agencies and the nursing home industry. This would be an impetus to new reform actions and encouragement to the numerous dedicated, sincere, hard-working nursing home employees who are trying to do their jobs in an unfavorable environment.\ George A. Bossman\ Warson Woods\ Page Ave. Problems\ The road going through Creve Coeur Lake Park or the approach embankment causing the river to flood the water plant are not concerns for me. However, why should the state spend $550 million on a road and bridge that would only serve the people of one county?\ Why doesn't St. Charles County have a bridge built upstream from the water plant? Sverdrup Corp. would be pleased to design another bridge. It could supply a corps of experienced field engineers who would assure first-class construction.\ The state Transportation Department could contribute by widening Olive Street Road and building an interchange where the new road from the new bridge intersected Olive. This could all be part of widening Highway 141. Bill Williams - Florissant - The July 26 letter by the Missouri Department of Transportation district engineer caused umbrage on several counts. The letter writer is employed by Missouri and is responsible for helping plant as much concrete as possible in a very short time. The Transportation Department should address these concerns:\ (1) The 6 cents per gallon increase in the gas tax foisted on Missourians in '92 promised to deliver highways to every burg in Missouri. Now, it's disclosed that inflation wasn't considered, so the state is $14 billion short - the amount of the tax proceeds that was to go to road construction.\ I don't have a degree in economics, but with inflation running at only about 3 percent, the state shouldn't be short the entire $14 billion. What happened to the money?\ (2) As far as the new bridge relieving traffic and not contributing to sprawl, I don't believe that theory. I lived in St. Charles and worked in St. Louis County around 1969. The Blanchette Bridge was supposed to relieve traffic snarls, speed up driving times and not destroy green space in St. Charles county. I'm not going to be fooled again with this proposal.\ (3) Interstate 70 between Columbia and St. Louis is in horrible shape. There are dangerous potholes, chunks of concrete missing and worn sections of highway that force a driver to drive in ruts created by prior traffic.\ If the highway department cannot keep Interstate 70 in good condition now, how is it going to maintain a lot more concrete?\ (4) The tax increase is touted as being for highways, mass transportation and alternative transportation. Why is the majority of the highway department's support going to this new bridge? Will that part of the project take the lion's share of the tax increase?\ In summary, I won't be voting for another tax increase when the last one wasn't sufficient. An audit should be done by an independent party to show exactly where the money went.\ As the saying goes, ""I'm from Missouri, show me"" - where the money went.\ Greg Bacon\ Columbia, Mo.\ Help The Ill\ The answer for the patient requesting help in the midst of a prolonged and terminal illness is to offer relief from the suffering through pain management and compassionate palliative care. The answer is not to step aside to make way for the physician with the lethal dose.\ Rev. Vincent R. Bommarito\ Archdiocesan Pro-Life Committee\ St. Louis\ Conspiracy Or Not?\ In response to the July 22 editorial, ""Life Is A Conspiracy,"" maybe modern people tend to be paranoid about the government because they reason and investigate beyond the apparent and obvious - as so-called primitive people did not. Modern man knows that world history is full of conspiracies - every war, revolution, bank robbery and some divorces.\ This is why there is a grand jury further investigating the Oklahoma City bombing and a campaign contribution investigation. The Persian Gulf War was, undeniably, ""one censored little war."" Every conspiracy the editorial mentions has intriguing and significant supporting evidence.\ Different people have different paranoias. While many fear the federal government, some are paranoid about the militias. The CIA has been involved in foreign political assassinations. It is not a big stretch to think one of our presidents is not to its liking.\ The number of people believing these conspiracy theories would undoubtedly increase if the mainstream media got on board. A conspiracy channel would be a smash.\ Robert Pujol\ St. Louis"

In fact, there are 12 candidates, including two Republicans and five Democrats, who often are collectively referred to in political circles by such labels as the ""unknown candidates"" - or worse.
\
Several of the seven are actively battling against such labels, saying that their admittedly low-budget campaigns are being unfairly ignored by the press and the political parties.
\
But most also are promoting their ""outsider"" status, saying they best represent the angry electorate.
\
The two Republicans are Dwight Watts, a Protestant minister from Joplin who helps run several homeless shelters, and Fred Salmons, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who operates a horse farm near Auxvasse and works as a registered nurse.
\
The five Democrats are Elmer Dapron, a St. Louis businessman; Sharon Rogers, an environmental activist from Wright City; Cedric Nazee Hawkins, a painter in Kansas City; Mary J. Johnson, a health-care worker in Kansas City; and Anthony B. Cox of Brentwood.
\
Dapron and Rogers have waged the most publicly active campaigns and have been most critical of the Democratic party leaders. Both have accused the party of discriminating against them by barring them from speaking at major party functions where Schoemehl and Carnahan were featured speakers.
\
Dapron said: ""I'm having difficulty getting my message across, even in Democratic forums. It trivializes my campaign.""
\
Rogers said recently, ""I don't think the public ever wanted the media to have the power to decide who the 'major' candidates are.""
\
Following are brief looks at six of the candidates, and some of their views. One candidate, Cox, did not return repeated phone calls. In most of the cases, the candidates did not have photos available.
\
REPUBLICANS
\
Dwight Watts, 59, of Joplin, helps run homeless shelters - one locally and the others in Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. He said he decided in April 1990 to run for governor. ""I decided that the poor man and the blue-collar worker needed some representation. Jefferson City now is run by a few for a few. Jesus is my director. We need to get Christ back in our state.""
\
He favors strict campaign limits, which would bar a candidate from receiving contributions of more than $50, and would limit total contributions to $10,000. ""When you raise $4 million, you owe your loyalty to those who gave you the $4 million,"" he said. ""Webster, he owes favors. I don't owe anybody any favors.""
\
Watts favors a state health-care plan and says he would work to get more jobs in Missouri. ""I would use the MoBucks plan to create small businesses in rural areas,"" he said.
\
He says he strongly supports women's rights and believes men who abuse or sexually harass women should face ""serious consequences.""
\
He favors collective bargaining for teachers and proposes to reduce the number of school districts in the state to one for each county. He also favors a voucher system to allow people to get tax money to help them send their children to private schools.
\
Fred Salmons, 51, lives in Auxvasse, near Columbia. He says he works as a registered nurse at the Callaway Community Hospital in Fulton and is a retired lieutenant colonel from the Air Force.
\
He says he is running because ""I'm basically tired of the politicians spending my tax money for things I think are inappropriate, such as the inflated salaries for politicians.""
\
Salmons says he wants to cut government waste, which he believes is rampant. ""I've seen the waste in the military,"" he said.
\
He proposes a common-sense approach to the state's ills. ""We've got empty houses and homeless people, so what's the problem here?"" he asked. ""People need to work on solutions.""
\
He is proposing that students go to school year-round and that prison inmates be required to work. He says the state could get additional money by increasing the state gas tax, which he says is lower than that in many other states.
\
DEMOCRATS
\
Sharon Rogers, 50, has a bachelor of science degree in environmental management from Lindenwood College in St. Charles. She is in business as an economic environmental consultant and heads Missourians Against Hazardous Waste, is president of the Waste Information Network and is on the policy board of the Missouri Waste Control Coalition.
\
Under then-Gov. Christopher S. Bond, she was appointed to the Missouri Dioxin Task Force. She also served on a state solid waste advisory committee. She attended the international Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro this month, saying Missouri had a stake in what happened.
\
She proposes building a recycling industry in Missouri, which would help the environment and create jobs. She says homeless people should be taught job skills and suggests starting apprenticeships for the homeless in urban areas.
\
Rogers says the state should focus more on delivering quality services than on saving money. Concern with the bottom line is what gets corporations into trouble, she says. Rogers believes that state government can be streamlined, with the savings then used to provide needed services. She says she is personally opposed to abortion, but favors abortion rights.
\
Elmer Dapron, 67, owns Cornucopia Communications, a small advertising agency in St. Louis. He says his best qualification is the fact that he's not a politician.
\
Dapron's campaign is focusing on jobs. He proposes that the state and the federal government redevelop once-thriving industries - such as the manufacture of small planes and light-rail cars - that have gone overseas.
\
Dapron is calling for assaults against the elderly to be considered felonies and for insurance scams that bilk the elderly to be treated as ""felonies with no probation."" The state's juvenile code should be stiffer to discourage youths from engaging in crime, he says.
\
Dapron said in his announcement speech that no government money should be spent on AIDS research, because the disease is largely preventable. ""The behavior that is most responsible for AIDS is illegal in the state of Missouri,"" Dapron said, referring to homosexuality.
\
Instead, government money should be used on other diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, which he says affect more people.
\
Cedric Nazee Hawkins, 33, of Kansas City, is a journeyman union painter specializing in commercial and industrial work. He has an associate's degree in business administration from Penn Valley Community College.
\
Hawkins is a member of the Universal African American Peoples Organization, based in St. Louis, that has put a candidate up for governor for the last three elections. His aim is to ""raise issues relevant to our community. This campaign is symbolic for disenfranchised people to have power at the state level.""
\
He says his campaign is based on an 11-point platform that includes: developing a state-sponsored emergency jobs program, with a strong affirmative-action component; providing a home and job skills for the homeless; revamping the tax structure ""to relieve the burden on the poor and middle class and place more responsibility on corporations""; freezing utility rates; universal family assistance to provide a minimum standard of living for everyone; eliminating the state's appointive judicial system and replacing that with elective judges; establishing a state homesteading program; and promoting alternative methods for disposal of hazardous wastes.
\
Mary Johnson, 50, of Kansas City, is a medical technician in a residential self-care facility for older people. ""I think I have a lot of good ideas to bring to Missouri. I'd like to see a lot of good things happen for Missouri,"" she said.
\
She proposes to eliminate waste in the public school system and is calling for a change in how it is funded. Only parents with school-age children should have to pay taxes to support public schools, she says. ""Young people without children in school and older persons over 65 who are retired shouldn't have to pay any school taxes.""
\
But taxes should still be used to provide programs for the elderly, she said, because ""the young should take care of the old.""
\
She wants stricter state standards for nursing homes. She says she would work to get more jobs in Missouri. She supports using tax money to build a high-speed ""bullet train"" across the state.
\
She also favors raising the minimum wage for all workers, and says she strongly favors equal retirement pensions and pay for men and women.
\
Johnson says she would push for a horse racing industry in Missouri.

217,"This article contains spoilers. Consider yourself alerted.\A Republican megadonor concerned with ""right-to-work"" and controversial legislation in Jefferson City clearing the way for a casino at Lake of the Ozarks are key plot devices in season two of ""Ozark.""\The minds behind the Netflix original series obviously did some research before filming, and allusions to real aspects of Missouri politics are prominent parts of the show's plot — though there are a few places where the creative license taken by the show-runners is hard to ignore.\The premise of the show: Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman), a financial planner from Chicago who launders money for a Mexican drug cartel, took his wife Wendy (Laura Linney) and their two kids to Osage Beach after the cartel learned he and his partner were skimming profits. Marty continues cleaning cash while he and Wendy work together to keep their family as intact as possible in their new lakeside environment.\In Season 1, the Byrdes quickly spread their wings by connecting with a powerful, old-school Missouri couple with acres of poppy plants used to produce heroin and a stereotypical trailer-trash family known for petty crimes and loyalty. A strip club, funeral parlor and lakeside lounge serve as cover for the drug money-laundering operation, but Marty has a bigger idea that serves as the focus of Season 2: opening up a casino at Lake of the Ozarks.\""Ozark,"" which largely skips the lake's recreational aspects to focus on crime and other seedy activities, was filmed mostly in Georgia. The show is not the first nor last piece of cinema set in the Ozarks in recent years — other examples include the movies ""Winter's Bone"" and ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" and the television series ""Sharp Objects"" — but ""Ozark"" spends a considerable amount of time building and living in its version of Missouri's political world.\From early on in Season 2, a character named Charles Wilkes plays a role in the casino scheme. Wilkes is described as a businessman from Kansas City who made a fortune selling agricultural equipment and spent some time in a nun-run orphanage, and he's known for giving large sums to Republican candidates and causes.\Wilkes appears to be a composite with characteristics of at least two Missouri megadonors. And it's clear from the start that whoever the inspiration for Wilkes is, it's somebody with a more conservative outlook than the Chicago-land Byrde family.\""Charles Wilkes is a union-busting, right-to-work toolbag,"" remarks Buddy, a character with a union background who lives with the Byrdes. ""Although he does have a couple of things on social issues worth listening to.""\The union-busting, right-to-work aspects of the character appear to be a nod to David Humphreys, who owns a Joplin roofing company. Humphreys has given millions to politicians who support a ban on mandatory union dues, or ""right-to-work,"" which Missouri voters soundly rejected in August. Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, has called Humphreys the ""No. 1 enemy of working labor"" in Missouri.\In one episode, Wilkes remarks ""about time"" when he is told by an aide that ""right-to-work"" will go to a vote.\In real life, unions and labor supporters were the ones to gather signatures to put the measure on the ballot. Voters resoundingly defeated it earlier this year.\The orphanage background, meanwhile, appears inspired by Rex Sinquefield, the St. Louis-area billionaire who spent part of his childhood in a Catholic institution and has given generously to Republican politicians.\When questioned by an FBI agent, Wilkes is referred to as the fifth-largest business owner in Missouri, who sits on various boards and who has donated $2.3 million to GOP candidates in state and local races. He is portrayed as a hands-on manipulator who himself is vulnerable to exploitation.\At one point, Wilkes and Wendy work to whip votes for casino legislation, using compromising information on opposing lawmakers to get their way.\One state senator, described a ""crusader,"" can't be persuaded to vote for the bill, though Wilkes apparently is able to convince or blackmail him into leaving town on the day of a crucial vote. Asked about the absence, the lawmaker rudely tells a reporter what he thinks of her before vanishing into his Capitol office and shooting himself in the head — a possible reference to the 2015 suicide of Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich.\Schweich, a staunch critic of Sinquefield's financial influence on state politics, at the time of his death was convinced he was the target of an anti-Semitic ""whisper campaign"" orchestrated by the then-chairman of the Missouri Republican Party, John Hancock.\Soon after Season 2 begins, a cartel lawyer working with the Byrdes highlights the trouble inherent in trying to open a new Missouri casino. One solution Marty comes up with is buying ""The Missouri Belle,"" an old paddlewheel boat.\""It's cheaper and faster than building an actual casino,"" Marty explains in Episode 2. He correctly notes that if you're going to open a casino in Missouri, ""it's got to be on a river,"" and adds, also accurately, that the number of casinos in Missouri is capped by law at 13.\But the plot takes some liberties regarding the legal locations of the Missouri casinos.\In Missouri, riverboat gambling can be authorized only in the ""main channels"" of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers as well as moats with 1000 feet of the riverbank.\The Osage River, a tributary of the Missouri River, connects the Lake of the Ozarks to the Missouri River by water, but tributaries aren't included in eligible casino sites — just the two big rivers and moats within 1,000 of the riverbank.\Osage Beach is more than 40 miles from where the Missouri River dips south at Jefferson City, meaning Marty's vision of an Osage Beach paddlewheel casino wouldn't be legal in real-world Missouri.\The pesky state constitution also would get in the way of the show's fictitious casino bill, which is supposed to be a way of raising the state casino cap from 13 to 14.\Because the cap was approved in 2008 by Missouri voters, it would take another constitutional amendment approved by a vote of the people to allow an additional number of riverboat gambling operations.\Lawmakers can put a measure on the ballot — like they did this year for a proposed gas tax hike — but the show's rapid progression from bill passage to casino opening makes it highly unlikely that the casino legislation was meant by the show's writers to go to a public ballot.\LeAnn McCarthy, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Gaming Commission, said people associated with the show reached out to ask for information about casino law before the show came out. (Netflix did not respond to a request for comment about its research.)\""We didn't know what to anticipate,"" she said. ""They called and asked us, 'If you could build a casino, what would it take?'""\Beyond its selective depiction of Missouri casino law, ""Ozark"" also includes some less-than-flattering portrayals of gaming commission members.\A commission representative tasked with evaluating the Byrdes' proposal expects a bribe in cash and tickets to a Grateful Dead-themed concert. Later, a chairman offers to approve the casino license if the Byrdes agree to exclude union workers from casino-related contracts. (The chairman expresses his support for ""right-to-work"" and makes this demand while megadonor Wilkes watches over his shoulder.)\McCarthy could not recall any such real-life incident of corruption or bribery. After asking around within the gaming commission, the only story rising to the surface was that of Robert Wolfson, she said.\Wolfson, a businessman who once owned the St. Louis Blues and chaired the gaming commission in the mid-1990s, was implicated about two decades ago over alleged conversations with a casino company's lawyer, Michael Lazaroff, concerning gambling license applications.\Wolfson denied Lazaroff's claim that the two discussed pending casino business while Wolfson chaired the commission. The Riverfront Times, a weekly newspaper in St. Louis, later reported that Wolfson admitted obtaining tickets to Las Vegas shows through Lazaroff and exchanging hundreds of phone calls with the casino lawyer.\McCarthy acknowledged that the creators of ""Ozark"" had some ""creative license"" in their fictional portrayal of the gaming commission.\""We've watched the episodes,"" McCarthy said. ""It is what it is.""\CREDIT: Will Schmitt"

Compassion Shown For The Busalacchis
\
The Missouri Supreme Court deserves a hearty commendation for ending the foolish prolonging of the Christine Busalacchi case. Judge Louis Kohn noted in a Jan. 27 article that ""this was a terrible situation to be in."" What an understatement!
\
For all intents and purposes, Busalacchi has been dead for six years. With severe brain damage, where was there hope? The answer is that there was no hope, only misery.
\
What this decision really signifies is the resumption of life for the rest of Busalacchi's family. Keeping her on life support has been a financial nightmare as well as an emotional roller coaster for her family.
\
Sam Lee, with Campaign Life-Missouri, claims that ""the decision may lead to cases in which people with less severe handicaps such as Down's syndrome are denied life-sustaining care.""
\
This premise is ludicrous. I have worked with Down's syndrome adults at a summer camp. These people have the ability to smile, to talk, to care for themselves and to learn. Not to mention having the biggest hearts of anyone around. In fact, I learned more from these people than I taught them.
\
That's life! Not drooling all over yourself, unable to focus, learn, care for yourself or have the potential for doing so. To quest for knowledge is to live, for death is stagnation. Peter Busalacchi and his family have been stagnated long enough. Let them live. Stephen Rice Mehlville
\
***** A Tax On Gas The Jan. 26 editorial, ""Tax Gasoline, Not All Energy,"" seems to be a curious response to what has become a pervasive national problem.
\
Everyone wants to see a stronger economy and a reduction in the deficit. But the deficit is a national problem and requires a national solution - not a punitive tax on a single, critical consumer good.
\
A national solution would include significant cuts in the rate of growth in federal spending and, if additional taxes also were required, a broad-based, value-added consumption tax, such as the one Sen. John Danforth and others are calling for.
\
That would be the fairest and least damaging kind of tax increase. Attempting to balance the federal budget at the gas pump would, on the other hand, punish lower-income consumers, create a drag on the economy and leave the deficit mostly untouched. Richard Telthorst Executive Director Missouri Oil Council Jefferson City
\
***** I am responding to the Jan. 24 editorial, ""A Gas Tax For Transit."" I am a disabled veteran and patriotic citizen, so I am ready to do my share to make public transportation a reality.
\
Several years ago, I moved my great aunt and uncle to St. Louis from Kansas City, where they could be near relatives as they lived their last years. Vince and Loretto were in their late 80s. Vince had lost his memory, and Loretto was losing the ability to do many daily tasks, but they were determined not to be a burden to anyone.
\
They didn't need much. All they wanted was an apartment close to a grocery and a church. In all of St. Louis, I found only two apartments from which they could safely walk to buy groceries and attend church services. Without a car, they were prisoners. Six months after moving into their new apartment, the grocery closed. They have since passed on.
\
I cannot help but think of their plight and that of countless others who, because of disability or merely a loss of certain abilities that come with aging, lose their freedom, their rights and their human dignity just because they are unable to drive a car.
\
I recently returned from a year of living in Italy. I had no car while there. I was free of car payments, the frustration of repairs, toxic fumes and the stress of operating a car. This was freedom! I rode in style. I would leisurely stroll to the nearby bus stop or train station and glide aboard, leaving all the nasty business of transportation to the driver.
\
As I looked at my fellow passengers, I saw in the eyes of the elderly riders my dear Loretto and Vince, my grandma, and my folks down the road and myself someday. They were all going about their lives with freedom and the dignity that comes with it.
\
Most of us in this country do not know the freedom of a good public transportation system. We have no idea of what we are missing. We believe there is no choice. And so we put up with the filth, expense and stress of being our own drivers, not to mention the constant threat of death from car accidents.
\
Yet we still call it freedom and continue building our towns and cities to accommodate autos instead of the real needs of all people. It is time to accept responsibility for those of us without the freedom of movement, for the havoc we have caused to the environment and begin moving toward efficient, ecological and physically, socially and psychologically healthier public transportation. Christine M. Doerr Rolla, Mo.
\
***** Late-Night Loss If David Letterman only knew how St. Louis television is treating him! Right now Channel 5 is showing him the utmost disrespect by pre-empting him with Rush Limbaugh's show. There can't be that many ultra-conservatives who would rather watch Limbaugh than Letterman at 11:30 p.m.!
\
Then Channel 4 says that it may keep the ""Love Connection"" at its 10:30 p.m. time slot when Letterman moves to CBS. Give me a break! Yes, there may be many loyal ""Love Connection"" viewers in the area, but think of the following Letterman has!
\
So Channel 4, wise up and put Letterman in its intended time slot when the show moves. Channel 5, show Dave some respect before he leaves. Give him back his time slot. I guarantee you that it would be a wise business move. Tom Harland Overland
\
***** Porno-graphics Concerning a Jan. 26 editorial about a computer bulletin-board service known as Offworld, I would like to clear up several points. The FBI was not simply ""acting on a report"" when it confiscated Joey Jay's equipment. According to the news, the FBI obtained accounts and monitored activity on the bulletin board for several months before the bust.
\
Jay's claim that it was nearly impossible to keep questionable pornographic material off his system because it was open to everyone is nonsense. The board could easily be set so that all file uploads go to a special area where they are verified by the system operator before being made available to the public. According to messages on other boards from underage Offworld callers, the uninhibited distribution of adult material to anyone on the board had been a common practice.
\
By having graphics depicting child pornography in his possession and also making adult pornographic material available to minors, Jay violated state and federal laws. Only his computer equipment was confiscated, although his father's house in which he was operating also could have been seized. It is difficult to understand why the Post-Dispatch would condone such activity but let this be a warning to all the Joey Jays in our community who are still in operation. Jeff Weible Barnhart
\
***** A Jan. 26 editorial lambastes the FBI for seizing the computer system of a Chesterfield man. The premise is that no searches or seizures should be conducted before a charge is filed.
\
The editorial asserts that our investigation was conducted ""without the slightest pretense of due process,"" that our activities were ""lawless,"" and violated ""the basic premises of the American justice system.""
\
Without commenting on the specifics of the case in question, which would be inappropriate at this time, I would like to respond to your editorial, which demonstrated extraordinary ignorance of the American judicial system, due process and the use of computers. The search warrant (a public record) detailed probable cause and was authorized by an appropriate magistrate as required by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.
\
For more than 200 years, law-enforcement officers have applied for search warrants to seize evidence of crimes, which is then evaluated with other information to determine what charges can be brought and who can be charged. Our Constitution requires presentation of evidence before a grand jury before anyone can be brought to trial. The Post-Dispatch's suggestion that people be charged before evidence is sought is simply astonishing.
\
Fortunately for our country, Congress and the courts have recognized the reality of computer crimes and the ability of people to copy electronically and instantaneously transmit illegal material. Numerous laws have been enacted to deal with computer theft, fraud and storage and transmission of obscenity. Anyone familiar with sophisticated computers knows the complexity of examining their contents without damaging or destroying the stored material.
\
Post-Dispatch readers deserve better than a carelessly prepared editorial - one that has no basis in law or fact. James W. Nelson Special Agent in Charge Federal Bureau of Investigation St. Louis
\
***** Deserved Honor I read with great interest and satisfaction Cal Thomas' Jan. 22 column about the former vice president and his wife. It's about time they received some fair press coverage. Like Thomas said, the Quayles, especially the vice president, were often unfairly criticized. I was glad to hear they are leaving office with their heads held high. Marilyn Pfotenhauer Chesterfield

219,"
I have heard and read about all I can stand about puppy mills and animal breeders mistreating their animals.
\
I am a dog breeder. My kennel is clean, and my dogs and puppies are well adjusted. I am licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and I belong to the Pet Breeders Association. I have seen people abuse their animals, but as a whole, the breeders I know raise good dogs and puppies.
\
A puppy I breed has its shots, is wormed and is taken to the vet for a checkup. Then it goes to a broker. There that puppy gets checked again. If it needs shots at that time, it gets them. It is held for 10 days to make sure it isn't sick and is strong enough for transport.
\
Then it goes to a pet shop. Most pet shops are not as clean as the places these puppies are used to. This basically is the end of a good puppy.
\
Pet shops are not inspected by any health official unless there is a problem. These pet shops buy puppies from anyone and charge outrageous prices. I would like to sell puppies to individuals. That way I know they go to people, not to a pet shop. I can keep track of them better.
\
My advice to the consumer: Read the ads. Make sure the breeder is USDA-licensed and belongs to the Pet Breeders Association. Check them out. You'll get your best dogs from independent kennels.
\
My advice to breeders: Check out your brokers and sell to individuals as much as possible. The USDA needs to check out all new kennels immediately and shut down those that need it.
\
We have had a lot of bad publicity in Missouri, but there are puppy mills all over the United States.
\
There have to be changes made in our industry, and it's going to take time. We in the pet industry who are dedicated are prepared to do just that.

Tax Held Ransom
\
Missouri state legislators want to raise the tax on gasoline and diesel. They say they have to so that we can get back some of the money that the feds took from us through another fuel tax.
\
Think about what they are saying: We have to pay more money to get back our own money. Why did we send it out of the state in the first place if we need it for projects back here in Missouri?
\
Raising taxes to get back our money sounds like ransom. I want to vote on the gas tax. Bill Beasley Columbia, Mo.
\
JFK Fact, Fiction
\
I am responding to the questions asked in the Feb. 11 editorial, ""Open The Kennedy Files.""
\
First, it asks about the so-called pristine bullet. The bullet is not pristine. Though the many critics do not mention it, this bullet is considerably flattened on one end. There is quite a bit of lead punched out and missing from the bottom of the bullet. All of the metal left in Gov. John Connally's wounds would account for this missing lead.
\
On the second question, it is simple to understand how Lee Harvey Oswald could have fired three shots in six seconds. To work the bolt of the Mannlicher Carcano takes 2.3 seconds.
\
If you start timing from the moment the first shot is fired you have enough time to work the bolt, aim, fire, work the bolt, aim and fire again. The critics seem to think that the assassin only worked the bolt just prior to the first shot. That is not realistic. Most likely, the Carcano was ready to fire immediately. So, if you really think about it, it is quite possible to fire three times in under six seconds.
\
Oliver Stone has directed an exciting, visually disturbing motion picture. But at the same time, he has only contributed to the continuing confusion regarding the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
\
Anyone who wants to take a serious look at the JFK assassination should do so with an open mind. The evidence is there in plain sight. All you have to do is look. Ronald Wilson Florissant
\
Just Say No Sex
\
In her Feb. 7 letter, Julie Martindale says that teen-agers are receiving a mixed message concerning sex. She is a teen-ager and finds the distribution of condoms to teens insulting. She says: ""If we have enough self-control to say no to drugs and alcohol, then surely we can control our sexual desires."" Martindale is convinced that abstinance is the best solution.
\
Finally a voice of reason, and from a teen-ager no less! She makes more sense than most adults. This young woman obviously has a mind of her own and isn't willing to be swayed by her peers or well-meaning but ignorant, adults.
\
Thank you, Julie Martindale, for speaking out. You are to be commended. It takes a great deal of courage to be an independent thinker. Adults should follow in your footsteps. Donna Winchester Hazelwood
\
No Progress
\
Civic Progress' stance on the building of Metro Link (Feb. 4 News Analysis), doesn't seem very civic minded, much less progressive. Perhaps the group should change its name to something like ""20-something white men looking out for themselves and their business buddies."" It is obvious they are not thinking about the long-term ecological consequences of relying upon highways as our major mode of transportation.
\
Mass transit is beneficial for people of all economic classes as well as the environment. Mass transit works very well in other communities and other countries. If Civic Progress would get behind the project, nothing could stop it. It would be interesting to learn who is benefiting from its resistance.

Be Earth Wise
\
In Mike O'Keefe's Feb. 12 letter, he lambastes animal rights groups, asking what ""other portions of our heritage should we be ashamed of,"" in addition to the trapping of animals for their fur?
\
For starters, how about the systematic genocide of the Indians for their land, the clear-cutting practices that destroyed many great forests, the pollution of our water supplies from toxic chemicals and industry dumping or the depletion of the ozone layer due to carbon monoxide emissions from our automobiles and smokestacks?
\
I choose to abandon the practices of the past and work toward the new American future - and hopefully save what little is left.

Taxpayer Service
\
Virgil Tipton's Feb. 10 Drive Time column did a fine job of capturing the essence of the advantages of combining vehicle personal property taxes with auto license plate fees.
\
Taxes, however distasteful, are necessary to provide the services needed by the citizens.
\
The purpose of any change in the system should be to either ease the tax burden or to make the process easier for the taxpayer.
\
The counties and their residents will benefit by a year-'round revenue source, better collection rate, better service to taxpayers and a consistent tax burden throughout the state.
\
In addition, residents will no longer be required to file vehicle personal property declarations which, if returned after March 1, carry a monthly penalty of 5 percent.
\
By combining vehicle personal property tax with license-plate fees, the state of Missouri has the opportunity to provide both convenience to the residents as well as cost saving efficiencies and increased revenue. B.J. McMahon Jr. Director of Revenue St. Louis County Clayton
\
Sales Pitch
\
A Florida automobile dealer polled potential customers as to how they could improve dealer-customer relationships and, consequently, sales. The overwhelming response was to eliminate all salespeople to reduce overhead costs and to indicate on all cars the bottom-line prices with no dickering.
\
Surprisingly, the dealer complied with the suggestions but did retain four ""experts"" to answer technical questions. The result was that sales improved significantly!
\
Since local current and projected new automobile sales are, to say the least, not encouraging, it would seem logical that at least one imaginative St. Louis area dealer would step forward and pursue the same approach as the Florida dealer to improve sales. Russ Champion Sappington
\
Gender Lesson
\
A Feb. 12 article told of a report that said women were treated unfairly in school and, as evidence, pointed out that by the time they graduate from high school, women do less well in mathematics than men.
\
The article does not mention the possibility that there is a genetic base to gender differences in learning styles and aptitudes. The overwhelming mass of scientific research into this area suggests that after puberty, boys tend more strongly toward an interest in mathematics and science and girls toward an interest in verbal activity.
\
The report in the paper merely assumes that all such differences, along with differences in athletic interests, are the result of bias and social conditioning. This assumption is almost certainly false, but it is at the very least debatable.
\
The report itself might well be biased, but the Post-Dispatch presents its assumptions as if they were sober scientific fact. The members of the newspaper staff have a right to their own opinions, however willfully blind, foolish and misinformed, but the place for those opinions is on the editorial page. They should not be allowed to serve as an interpretive frame for news stories as if they were simply matters of fact and common knowledge.

220,"COLUMBUS, Ohio * New state laws taking effect today give livestock in California more living room, approve direct-to-consumer wine shipments in Massachusetts and levy the ultimate punishment on would-be teen drivers in Nevada by denying them licenses if they skip too much school.\Other laws will allow Louisiana teens as young as 16 to register to vote, crack down on meth dealers in Michigan, end tax breaks for Hollywood in North Carolina and raise the minimum wage in Ohio, New York, Rhode Island and elsewhere.\Although it doesn't take effect until early February, a New York law captures this year's ""Who knew?"" prize by banning tiger selfies, which have been used by young men as profile photos on social media sites.\A look at some of the new laws taking effect today:\ALCOHOL\Wine connoisseurs will be popping the cork over a new law taking effect today that allows out-of-state wineries to ship bottles directly to consumers in Massachusetts. The drive for direct wine shipments had been stalled for years before getting a big boost from former New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe. Now a winemaker in Washington state, Bledsoe complained to lawmakers he could not send his products to Massachusetts residents, including fans and former teammates such as current Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.\ANIMALS\In California, a ballot initiative approved by voters in 2008 takes effect restricting the confinement of egg-laying hens, breeding sows and veal calves. The Humane Society of the United States says the law goes further than any in the country when coupled with a law signed by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger that extends the space requirements for egg-laying hens to out-of-state suppliers.\In Utah, cities and towns can no longer ban specific dog breeds within their limits. At least 10 cities now have restrictions that ban ownership of breeds such as pit bulls.\CRIME\In California, a ""yes means yes"" standard for sex between college students takes effect, requiring ""an affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity,"" meaning silence or a lack of resistance can no longer be deemed consent.\In Michigan, rape evidence may be better organized and tracked under laws designed to help ensure that kits aren't caught in the sort of backlog found when more than 11,000 untested boxes were discovered in a Detroit Police storage facility in 2009.\In Louisiana, law enforcement agencies must provide a tally of the number of untested rape kits on their shelves by today, part of a law that took effect in August.\DRUG ABUSE\In Michigan, buying cough and cold medicines for the purpose of making methamphetamine will be illegal under another series of measures intended to crack down on meth makers. The laws also prohibit asking someone to buy the ingredients and require state police to add meth offenders to a national database.\ELECTIONS\In Louisiana, 16- and 17-year-olds will be able to register to vote when obtaining a drivers license, though they still won't be able to vote until they turn 18.\In North Carolina, individuals filing as a candidate in a party primary must have had an affiliation with that party for at least 90 days before filing a candidacy notice.\A Delaware law establishes new rules for allocating campaign contributions among joint account holders, such as when spouses submit a political contribution using a single check.\ENVIRONMENT\In North Carolina, home sellers will have to disclose whether they know if underground oil and gas rights have been sold.\In New York State, consumers must begin recycling old computers, televisions and video game consoles instead of throwing them in the trash.\In the face of a three-year drought, new California laws require water districts and other local entities to develop plans to manage their groundwater and allow the state to intervene if necessary.\HEALTH\In Louisiana, smoking will be banned within 25 feet of public entrances to state office buildings, as a way to lessen exposure to secondhand smoke.\HUNTING\In North Carolina, the state Wildlife Resources Commission faces new restrictions on how high it can raise fees on hunting, fishing and trapping licenses. Starting with the new year, the fees can't be raised beyond a widely used measure of inflation averaged over the previous five years.\MOTOR VEHICLES\In California, drivers licenses will be available for people in the country illegally.\In Nevada, students who are declared habitually truant could be delayed from obtaining a drivers license, or could have their license suspended.\In Florida, all children ages 4 and 5 will be required to sit in a child safety seat or booster seat instead of using just a car seat belt.\In Indiana, license plates will be required on motor scooters for the first time, after complaints about unsafe driving by those who have lost their licenses because of drunken driving arrests or other offenses.\In Michigan, lawmakers closed a loophole so motorcyclists can no longer buy a temporary permit every riding season without taking a safety or skills test needed for a full endorsement.\Massachusetts will finally allow ""hold open"" clips on pumps at self-service gasoline stations, ending motorists' complaints particularly in winter about being in one of the few states where the clips weren't allowed.\In Utah, police will be required to impound the vehicles of uninsured drivers instead of just having the option to do so.\SOCIAL MEDIA\In New York in February, it becomes illegal to pose for a photo with a lion, tiger or other big cat. The measure, which specifically prohibits contact between members of the public and big cats at animal shows, passed after self-portraits with the animals started becoming more popular online, particularly with some young men on dating sites.\TAXES\In North Carolina, Republican lawmakers who approved an income tax cut also took away breaks to Hollywood and cab drivers. Expiring is a 25 percent tax credit for TV and movie productions that in 2013 allowed producers to forego paying $61 million in state taxes. It's being replaced in 2015 by a grant program for video productions capped at $10 million.\In Virginia, drivers can expect to see a 5 cents-per-gallon increase in the cost of gas, while Maryland's gas tax is set to rise about 3.5 cents.\In Mississippi, totally disabled veterans and their surviving spouses who have not remarried would not have to pay property taxes on their primary residence.\WAGES\The minimum wage goes up today in several states, including Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. A wage increase in New York takes effect Wednesday. In addition, troopers in Oklahoma get their first pay raise in seven years.\WEAPONS\In Pennsylvania on Monday, a law takes effect that's designed to give the National Rifle Association, or any gun owner, a better chance at successfully challenging local firearms ordinances in court. In general, Pennsylvania bars its municipalities from enforcing firearms ordinances that are stronger than state law. But the NRA has complained that dozens of local ordinances go unchallenged in Pennsylvania courts by residents who can prove it harmed them.\In California, law enforcement agencies are required to develop policies that encourage officers to search the state's database of gun purchases as part of routine welfare checks. The bill was prompted by sheriff's deputies' failure to detect the danger posed by a man who weeks later embarked on a deadly rampage in May near the University of California, Santa Barbara.\Credit: ANDREW WELSH-HUGGINS; Associated Press"
221,"How President Bill Clinton's budget would be spent, along with the likely GOP response and how the issue or agency fared last year\SOCIAL SECURITY\CLINTON'S PROPOSAL\The budget calls for spending 62 percent of government surpluses expected over the next 15 years -- a projected $2.76 trillion -- to help bolster Social Security's cash reserves. Clinton wants the government to invest about $700 billion of the cash in the stock market to try to increase its value -- the first time Social Security reserve money has been invested privately. With the rest, Clinton would use a complicated accounting strategy to simultaneously pay down the national debt and obligate more of the country's future resources to Social Security. Administration officials say the plan would keep Social Security from financial crisis until 2055. Clinton has also proposed using an additional 12 percent of government surpluses over the next 15 years -- or $536 billion -- to subsidize new 401(k)-style retirement savings accounts for most working Americans.\LIKELY GOP RESPONSE\Republican leaders have agreed to set aside 62 percent of expected government surpluses while lawmakers discuss Social Security's future, but they disagree with the specifics of Clinton's plan. They are strongly opposed to having the government invest in the stock market, saying free enterprise would inevitably be corrupted by politics. They also have accus ed the president of using funny bookkeeping that would compound debts already owed to Social Security by the rest of the government without saying how they will ultimately be paid.\LAST YEAR\Clinton had asked lawmakers to hold off spending government surpluses during a year of town-hall meetings on Social Security's future.\TAXES\CLINTON'S PROPOSAL\The budget proposes tax credits and other tax relief totaling $36.2 billion over five years. Among those aimed at the middle class: a credit of up to $500 for stay-at-home parents caring for infants under age 1 and a $1,000 credit for people providing long-term care for disabled people. Disabled workers could take a $1,000 credit for costs associated with their jobs, employers would be encouraged to provide health insurance and the steel industry would get $300 million in breaks to combat foreign dumping.\The administration proposes $82 billion in new or increased taxes, led by a 55-cents-a-pack cigarette tax that would yield $34.5 billion over five years. Sixteen corporate tax loopholes would be closed, raising $7.1 billion. In total, the package envisions 79 new or increased taxes, mostly on business.\LIKELY GOP RESPONSE\Republicans are pushing a broad across-the-board income tax rate cut of at least 10 percent, as well as relief from the ""marriage penalty"" that hits millions of two-earner couples and elimination of the estate tax on inheritance.\LAST YEAR\The president proposed $24.2 billion in tax relief and $106.5 billion in new revenue, again led by tobacco taxes that never materialized.\CHILD CARE\CLINTON'S PROPOSAL\Head Start, child care and foster care programs and would get increased spending. The budget calls for $6.3 billion over five years to expand the tax credit for expenses to families earning up to $59,000 a year and to families in which one parent stays home to care for children. It seeks $7.5 billion over five years to offer more child care subsidies to working poor families. For Head Start, Clinton wants a $607 million boost to $5.3 billion to serve an additional 42,000 children. The budget seeks to help children in foster care who turn 18 by letting them keep their public health insurance.\LIKELY GOP RESPONSE\Head start has found considerable support among Republicans, as well as Democrats, in Congress. GOP leaders have preferred across- the-board tax cuts to more child care spending.\LAST YEAR\Clinton proposed a $22 billion child care program, which went nowhere in Congress, though there was GOP interest in aiding stay-at- home parents. After some skirmishes, Congress approved bipartisan legislation renewing the Head Start program.\HEALTH INSURANCE\CLINTON'S PROPOSAL\The budget asks for $44 million in tax credits to encourage small businesses to join coalitions to offer health insurance to workers. It seeks $2 billion over five years to help people with disabilities keep Medicare and Medicaid when they return to work and a new $1,000 tax credit to pay for needed adaptive technology and other special expenses.\The budget allows $1.1 billion over five years for states to offer Medicaid and the new children's health insurance program to many immigrants, including children, pregnant women and those with disabilities. Immigrants would be eligible even if they arrived in the country after enactment of the 1996 welfare bill.\LIKELY GOP RESPONSE\Republicans also want to encourage small businesses to join in health insurance purchasing groups. And bipartisan legislation to aid people with disabilities who want to return to work is pending in the Senate. But the GOP has been cool to restoration of benefits for immigrants, saying people should not come to the United States expecting public aid.\LAST YEAR\The House approved legislation aiding people with disabilities, though it did not include the centerpiece -- letting them keep health benefits. It died in the Senate. Some food stamp benefits were restored for legal immigrants.\EDUCATION\CLINTON'S PROPOSAL\Education spending would be $31.8 billion in 2000, increasing last year's estimated $28.6 billion. The increases would go to about $34.9 billion in 2001, continuing along those lines through 2004. Clinton called for $1.4 billion for the second year of funding for the so- called 100,000 new teachers initiative and for $22 billion in bonds for school construction and modernization. The White House lost a similar construction plan last year. The president proposes tripling an after-school and summer program aimed at ending social promotion and boosting teacher training. But he also proposes budget cuts to a program negotiated in last year's renewal of the higher education laws. He sparred with Republicans over subsidizing private banks' lending to students.\LIKELY GOP RESPONSE\Republicans say they're disappointed that the president did not fund local education block grants designed to give states and districts local flexibility and did not increase special education funding significantly. The GOP is looking at its own school construction proposals and wants to see results before doling out another round of funds for new teachers.\LAST YEAR\Congress approved a $33.11 billion plan for education programs, a 12.6 percent increase in which favored projects won big. Charter schools got a hefty 25 percent boost to $100 million.\TRANSPORTATION\CLINTON'S PROPOSAL\The administration wants to spend $45.5 billion on transportation, an increase of about 8.6 percent. Once again, there's more money for highway and aviation safety and more to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. There's also spending aimed at triggering economic growth, including about $180 million in loan guarantees for U.S. shipyards. A big gainer is the Office of the Transportation Secretary, where the budget would jump from $89 million to $132 million. The Coast Guard, which is overseen by the transportation secretary, would get $4.297 billion, up about 6.7 percent.\LIKELY GOP RESPONSE\Republicans are also talking about similarly isolating money for aviation improvements. But there could be a fight over an administration proposal to raise the Passenger Facility Charge, an airline ticket tax that is used for airport construction.\LAST YEAR\The administration and the GOP found themselves in agreement on transportation. They approved the nation's largest highway spending bill, $203 billion, and they agreed that all money collected through the gas tax would be spent on road, bridge and mass transit improvements.\DEFENSE\CLINTON'S PROPOSAL\The Pentagon would get $261 billion in new spending in 2000, including the largest pay raise for military members in nearly two decades -- 4.4 percent in 2000, followed by five consecutive increases of 3.9 percent. Nearly $3 billion would go for Bosnia peacekeeping and enforcement of no-fly zones over Iraq. Clinton wants $4.25 billion for missile defense in 2000. He asks Congress for two new rounds of base closings -- in 2001 and 2005.\LIKELY GOP RESPONSE\Republican proposals are roughly in line with Clinton's, calling for increased spending to modernize weaponry, improve troop living conditions and invest in missile defense. But the Senate Armed Services Committee already has proposed pay increases bigger than Clinton's.\LAST YEAR\Congress approved $264 billion for the Defense Department in the current year, including $4.5 billion in extra money to improve overall preparedness and pay for Bosnia and Iraq operations.\MEDICAL RESEARCH\CLINTON'S PROPOSAL\The National Institutes of Health would get a $320 million boost to its $15.6 billion budget. That's a 2 percent increase for NIH, the nation's biggest financer of medical research. It includes an additional $35 million for AIDS-related research, totaling $1.8 billion, and a new $50 million National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. The Food and Drug Administration, the nation's top consumer protection agency, would get a massive 17 percent increase, or an additional $190 million.\LIKELY GOP RESPONSE\For the NIH, Republicans have outspent Clinton for several years as part of their goal to double its funding by 2003, and the GOP is expected to pass a much larger increase again this year. Some Republican leaders have signaled support for some increased funds to the FDA to speed up new products.\LAST YEAR\Congress passed a 14 percent increase, giving the NIH $15.6 billion to spend in 1999. That was above Clinton's request for a 9 percent increase. Congress left the FDA's budget flat.\TOBACCO\CLINTON'S PROPOSAL\The government would raise $8 billion by imposing a new 55-cent-a- pack cigarette tax and by tacking on a 5-cent tax that wasn't supposed to kick in until 2002. Even without new legislation, the 24- cent cigarette tax is set to jump by 10 cents per pack next year. Under Clinton's plan, the tax would rise to 94 cents per pack in 2000. Over five years, these new tobacco taxes would raise an additional $34.5 billion -- a substantial chunk of the total $82 billion in new taxes and fees.\LIKELY GOP RESPONSE\Republicans oppose all new taxes, including cigarette taxes. As for recouping of state tobacco money, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are backing legislation to bar the federal government from seizing these dollars.\LAST YEAR\Clinton proposed new cigarette taxes as part of his comprehensive tobacco legislation, which died in Congress.\AGRICULTURE\CLINTON'S PROPOSAL\The Agriculture Department would get $55.2 billion in 2000 to fund a range of programs from food stamps to food aid and rural water programs. One major omission from the budget, however, is money to reform crop insurance for farmers. Clinton has also proposed $72 million, or a 24 percent increase, to boost food safety efforts within the USDA and Food and Drug Administration, including money for increased inspections and better research.\LIKELY GOP RESPONSE\Republican leaders are mostly unhappy with Clinton's lack of a plan to reform crop insurance. They are also likely to be fiercely opposed to a proposal that would require meat and poultry companies to pay ""user fees"" for government inspection services.\LAST YEAR\The current year's budget is actually about $8.2 billion higher than Clinton's 2000 proposal, mainly because of large aid packages last year for U.S. farmers and Russia.\MEDICARE AND LONG-TERM CARE\CLINTON'S PROPOSAL\The president wants 15 percent of government surpluses expected over the next 15 years -- a projected $686 billion -- to bolster Medicare. With that cash infusion, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, could hold on until 2020. Clinton also is proposing a new $1,000-a-year tax credit to help families pay for long-term care for elderly or disabled relatives -- something not covered by Medicare. The administration estimates 2 million Americans would benefit, at a cost to the government of $5.5 billion.\LIKELY GOP RESPONSE\Republicans leaders have not said whether their plans would leave money for Medicare. Before making any decisions about the program, they say they will await recommendations from a bipartisan advisory commission due to report March 1. Many support tax credits for long- term care expenses.\LAST YEAR\After trimming billions from Medicare payments in 1997, lawmakers were besieged by complaints from health care providers. Further spending curbs proposed by Clinton this year are sure to be controversial.\ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES\CLINTON'S PROPOSAL\The administration wants increases for most environmental programs. The budget proposed a $1 billion ""land legacy initiative"" that includes $900 million to buy land so it can't be developed. To help cities combat sprawl, the budget proposes new ""Better America Bonds"" -- financed by $700 million in federal tax credits -- to be used by communities to set aside ""green spaces"" and promote better urban planning. The budget calls for a $730 million increase in spending on research to address global warming, in cluding sharp increases in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.\LIKELY GOP RESPONSE\Congress rejected many of the same climate initiatives last year. A $200 million ""clean air fund"" will be viewed by some Republicans as trying to impose the climate agreement. While much of the proposed $900 million in spending for new land purchases may get a warm welcome in Congress, there likely will be arguments over where the money should be spent.\LAST YEAR\The administration won more money for energy efficiency programs and as part of a last-minute budget agreement got an additional $200 million for climate change technology."
222,"In an effort to give voters more information about this year's statehouse races, the News-Leader is surveying candidates on top-of-mind state and national issues and publishing the answers, starting with candidates in contested primaries.\Two Republicans, Bill Owen and Stephanos Freeman, are running for their party's nomination for House District 131, which covers northern Springfield and north-central Greene County.\The incumbent, Sonya Anderson, R-Springfield, is term-limited and running for Greene County Commission. Democrat Allison Schoolcraft is unopposed in her party's primary.\Here's what the candidates said, with minor editing for length and style, in the order they'll appear on the ballot.\How old are you?\67 years old.\What do you do for work?\Recently retired from a nearly 40-year career in banking in Springfield.\Why are you the best candidate for your district?\My years of experience. From local banker, to community boards and having chaired the Governmental Relations committees of both the Springfield Chamber and the Missouri Bankers Association. I even served in the Missouri House in the 1980s, which will bring a different perspective to the chamber.\What is your opinion of the state's response to the coronavirus outbreak thus far?\I am one who believes government that governs closest to the people governs best. By allowing the local authorities latitude to determine what is best for each community meant Ozark County, which has only had a few cases, is not under the same guidelines as a Springfield or St. Louis. As far as how each governmental subdivision has handled their responsibilities would require a discussion of each one individually. Some have performed better than others.\What will you do as a legislator to help the state recover from the outbreak moving forward?\We have to look for ways we can return to business activity while at the same time adhering to measures to keep everyone safe. Legislatively, we need to continue to pass legislation that makes it easier for business to operate and grow. The retail sector has been particularly hit hard. We need some protection from litigation if the business is following best practices to prevent COVID-19 from impacting their employees and customers.\What will you do as a legislator to minimize the impact of any economic downturn on the state budget?\This is not a simple fix. We have not done a very good job of doing performance auditing of state departments to make sure we are operating in the most efficient manner possible. It is stunning how much the state budget has grown over the last 40 years. Doing audits will also assist the House Budget Committee when it begins the appropriations process each year to determine where dollars need to be allocated.\Do you think calls for changes to the state's criminal justice system are justified? If so, why, and which changes do you support? If not, why not?\I would agree that there are changes needed in the state's justice system to not only see that violent criminals stay in jail and serve their terms but to also see that nonviolent offenders are not treated in the same fashion and are not spending long sentences and that they find help in rehabilitation so they can re-enter society and the workplace.\The recently passed Senate Bill 600 went a long way to addressing some of these issues. (Editor's note: SB 600 increased penalties on violent crimes, especially those committed with a weapon, and made it easier to prosecute people who plan crimes or who are gang members.)\What will you do as a legislator to improve educational outcomes for Missouri students?\The COVID-19 outbreak showed us how inadequate our abilities were to deliver internet educational services to rural students and districts. We have got to focus on a strategy to close that gap. Also make sure we have alternatives for students in underachieving districts so that every child has the opportunity to a quality education.\Do you support the proposal to expand Medicaid on the August ballot? Why or why not?\Since this will be determined by voters, I think the better question is: How are we going to pay for the state's portion of the cost? Some estimates say that will be over $100 million. From a legislator's standpoint we need to think about ways we can use new funds approved by voters to reduce the cost of state services in other areas. A good example is mental health. If we can reduce our jail and prison populations by using Medicaid funds to house inmates in a better and less expensive environment we can maybe redirect savings to the state's Medicaid obligation. With 60 percent of the Greene County jail population having mental health as an underlying issue we might be able to derive some real savings. Otherwise we will have to determine where to make additional cuts. Remember, the governor has already withheld $450 million from the current budget.\How will you address concerns about the state's aging infrastructure?\The most sensible method is a gas tax increase. Like a use tax, the amount you pay is determined by your usage. Also, out-of-state drivers who use our road system will pay their proportionate share of the cost (from gas they purchase here.)\What issue not mentioned so far do you plan to make a priority if you win your election? Why that one?\It is a policy issue. For a number of years, the Missouri Housing Development Corp. has been focused on building apartments to provide housing for people of low-to-moderate income. By redirecting their focus to our older neighborhoods rebuilding the housing stock of the homes in our older neighborhoods we will not only provide adequate housing for those in need but for no additional money help to rebuild our older neighborhoods.\What else should voters know about you?\That I truly love the Ozarks and the people in it and have, over the course of a lifetime, been involved in numerous community organizations as a way to give back to the community that has meant so much to me.\How old are you?\48 years old.\What do you do for work?\I am currently in factory production. I was previously in education, mental health, and social services.\Why are you the best candidate for your district?\I am more representative of my district. The legislature is almost exclusively made up of lawyers and businessmen. Some notable exceptions are an accountant, a teacher, and a doctor. Look at our area. How does that represent OUR DISTRICT. The people making the laws do not feel the negative effects of the laws they make unless it's regulation and taxes. (MOST of that is federally-mandated). I have no conflicts of interest. I don't have contractor friends or connections with organizations that profit from the state. Whether or not this is currently a salient issue, the appearance of impropriety undermines the faith of the people in our government.\Because of life experience and formal education in sociology, anthropology, and history, I have spent far too much time figuring general things out. This enables me to see larger trends most do not while being actively involved in average everyday life.\What is your opinion of the state's response to the coronavirus outbreak thus far?\Missouri's response to COVID-19 has been a clown show. Rather than taking a measured response, it forced everyone to prepare for a worst-case scenario that didn't even come close to happening. They undermined respect for themselves and our state apparatus. They should have made preparations to protect the most vulnerable and either kept the state open or closed for a mere week or two. Regardless, the closure should have only pertained to businesses and not forced people indoors and out of churches, that part should have been voluntary. On a side note, how is fast food more essential than a church?\What will you do as a legislator to help the state recover from the outbreak moving forward?\I will obstruct any unreasonable efforts to infringe upon the people. If there is another wave, the people who should stay at home are those with symptoms. Any benefits or fines should go to those who need to stay home. If we are ever getting overwhelmed, then people will mostly act accordingly once they know. We could create protections for them to prevent job loss, eviction, or starvation and provide medications.\What will you do as a legislator to minimize the impact of any economic downturn on the state budget?\With interest rates what they are, and inflation where it is likely to be, bonds are very practical. As chaos ensues in other states, it makes sense that we should be able to lure business into our area, thus increasing revenues in our district, though there are no guarantees in business. Though I am no fan of taxes, Amazon and eBay drive out local business and have been profiting off the lockdown, simultaneously supporting the vary movements that destroys our cities. This needs to be rectified.\Do you think calls for changes to the state's criminal justice system are justified? If so, why, and which changes would you support? If not, why not?\Justified or not it needs to be dealt with. The Black Lives Matter organization is very subversive and wants to destroy America. We need to address what makes the movement attractive. 90% of those incarcerated are there for drug offenses. (Editor's note: Slightly less than 15 percent of people were incarcerated for drug crimes as of the end of 2017, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.) The majority of the problems with police interactions are drug-related, be it stops or arrests. The optics are not good. We need more body cams on officers to show what is happening, and BLM is against this (Editor's note: The local Black Lives Matter chapter supports giving Springfield police body cameras.). We could live-stream it, with a significant delay to prevent it being used by criminals. We need to focus on violence and property crime. We need tax-incentives for blighted areas which would help north Springfield as well. We need for people to see the natural consequences of their actions and take responsibility. Some may see this as soft, but I assure you this is actually real hard.\What will you do as a legislator to improve educational outcomes for Missouri students?\Make a degree reflect abilities and competencies. Have a graduation test to be independently administered. No more play tests that can be fixed or participation points. As core competencies for graduation are made, certifications of skills can be made available. State-funded colleges need to make online courses standard for classes not requiring labs and pass the savings along. No more student activity fees for non-campus students, which significantly reduces price for continuing education. These too could include outcome-based certifications of skills. This would benefit those with some college and make sure people don't graduate without marketable skills. Those who graduated without marketable skills could audit these classes and then get certifications.\Do you support the proposal to expand Medicare on the August ballot? Why or why not?\There will be far-ranging impacts both positive and negative. I will go with the voters' decision. The positive effects include: more health coverage, more occupation mobility for low wage earners, and more flexibility for small business since many wouldn't need to have benefits. The negatives include: subsidized healthcare prices, a move toward socialism, lower quality care for under-employed individuals, and probably either a cut in services or higher taxes. (Editor's note: The official state analysis estimates an impact ranging from at least $200 million in increased costs to savings of $1 billion by 2026.) That is not my policy that is just the reality of the situation. It is up to the voters — think hard do you want to pay for more services. Personally I would rather be able to get medication and send out labs without a doctor's prescription since I generally know what is wrong with my health. If we could do that the cost would be a lot lower.\How will you address concerns about the state's aging infrastructure?\This is always an issue and never seems to get addressed. I am going to risk sounding like a nut job, liar, or big spender here by thinking outside of the box. I would like to see Missouri take the lead on tech for a change. Starlink is creating a global network of satellite internet connections; it is supposed to be high-speed but, as with any such endeavor, it will take time and have spotty coverage for a while. We could build a partnership along with the federal government to create access towers across the state in exchange for secure networks. This would increase jobs in rural areas, make Missouri competitive, save wear on roads, and prevent foreign and criminal entanglements. The key would be getting a good deal. This is going to happen, it is a matter of if we will be first and whether we will have leverage.\What issue not mentioned so far do you plan to make a priority if you win your election? Why that one?\I will be a cultural warrior. It is time to stick it to the leftists using their own terminology. I will get God in the classroom by emphasizing the historical relevance of religion in the development of our nation. I will emphasize freedom as the basis of all ""systems."" If they want to blame the system they will have to start with themselves. If gender is a social construct, why should society accept theirs over the universally accepted one? Tolerance can't be an excuse to promote intolerance of free thought and free speech. As it stands, the left creates new groups to be oppressed by the oppressor which has somehow become us; we can play that game, or switch it, as they wish to confine others by labels while expanding their own. Either way, I can disrupt their plans by toying with their terms.\What else should voters know about you?\I am an ideas man. Sure, not all of them are popular, but that's what the other 162 members are for. The Missouri House needs someone who doesn't think in the typical ways that lawyers and businessmen do. I am also real cheap and know how to live off little money, but I am willing to spend if the benefits are high enough.\I am actually pretty concerned about all the extremism in the current climate. When people are pushed continuously left there is bound to be a hard push towards the right. Authoritarians come in all stripes; we should do our best to avoid them. With all the chaos, it is all too tempting to push for law and order for its own sake rather than because it is needed.\Austin Huguelet is the News-Leader's politics reporter.

CLINTON ECONOMIC PLAN
\
Here are excerpts from President Bill Clinton's address Wednesday to a joint session of Congress:
\
WHEN PRESIDENTS speak to the Congress and the nation from this podium, typically they comment on the full range of challenges and opportunities that face the United States. But this is not an ordinary time. And for all the many tasks that require our attention, I believe tonight one calls on us to focus, to unite, and to act - and that is our economy. For more than anything else, our task tonight as Americans is to make our economy thrive again.
\
. . . We have always been a people of youthful energy and daring spirit. And at this historic moment, as communism has fallen, as freedom is spreading around the world, as a global economy is taking shape before our eyes, Americans have called for change - and now it is up to those of us in this room to deliver for them.
\
. . . We need to break the old habits of both political parties and say there can be no more something for nothing, and admit frankly that we are all in this together.
\
I well remember 12 years ago President Reagan stood at this podium and told you and the American people that if our debt were stacked in thousand-dollar bills, the stack would reach 67 miles into space. Well, today that stack would reach 267 miles.
\
I tell you this not to assign blame for this problem. There is plenty of blame to go around - in both branches of the government and both parties. The time has come for the blame to end. I did not seek this office to place blame. I come here to accept responsibility, and I want you to accept responsibility with me, and, if we do right by this country, I do not care who gets the credit for it.
\
. . . Tonight I want to talk with you about what government can do because I believe government must do more. But let me say first that the real engine of economic growth in this country is the private sector.
\
And second, that each of us must be an engine of growth and change. The truth is that, as government creates more opportunity in this new and different time, we must also demand more responsibility in turn.
\
. . . To create jobs and guarantee a strong recovery, I call on Congress to enact an immediate package of jobs investments of over $30 billion, to put people to work now, to create a half a million jobs, jobs to rebuild our highways and airports, to renovate housing, to bring new life to rural communities, and spread hope and opportunity among our nation's youth.
\
. . . The heart of this plan deals with the long term. It is an investment program designed to increase public and private investment in areas critical to our economic future and it has a deficit reduction program that will increase the savings available for the private sector to invest, will lower interest rates, will decrease the percentage of the federal budget claimed by interest payments and decrease the risk of financial market disruptions that could adversely affect our economy.
\
Over the long run, all this will bring us a higher rate of economic growth, improved productivity, more high-quality jobs and an improved economic competitive position in the world. In order to accomplish both increased investment and deficit reduction - something no American government has ever been called upon to do at the same time before - spending must be cut and taxes must be raised. The spending cuts I recommend were carefully thought through in a way to minimize any adverse economic impact, to capture the peace dividend for investment purposes and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to more investment. The tax increases and the spending cuts were both designed to assure that the costs of this historic program to face and deal with our problems will be borne by those who could readily afford it the most.
\
. . . We propose a permanent investment tax credit for the smallest firms in this country with revenues of under $5 million.
\
That's about 90 percent of the firms in America, employing about 40 percent of the work force, but creating a big majority of the net new jobs for more than a decade. And we propose new rewards for entrepreneurs who take new risks. We propose to give small business access to all the new technologies of our time, and we propose to attack this credit crunch which has denied small business the credit they need to flourish and prosper.
\
With a new network of community development banks and $1 billion to make the dream of enterprise zones real, we propose to bring new hope and new jobs to storefronts and factories from South Boston to South Texas to South Central Los Angeles.
\
This plan invests in our roads, our bridges, our transit systems and high-speed railways and high-tech information systems. And it provides the most ambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with state and local government of our time, to put people to work and to preserve the environment for our future. . . . We must provide special assistance to areas and to workers displaced by cuts in the defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocations.
\
But all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail - let me say this again; I feel so strongly about this - all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail unless we also take this year - not next year, not five years from now, but this year - bold steps to reform our health care system.
\
. . . Unless we change the present pattern, 50 percent of the growth in the deficit between now and the year 2000 will be in health care costs. By the year 2000 almost 20 percent of our income will be (used for) health care.
\
. . . Later this spring, after the first lady and the many good people who are helping her all across the country complete their work, I will deliver to Congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform . . . so that no one will be denied the coverage they need but so that our economic future will not be compromised either.
\
. . . If we believe in jobs and we believe in learning, we must believe in rewarding work. . . . the new direction I propose will make this solemn, simple commitment: by expanding the refundable earned income tax credit, we will make history; we will reward the work of millions of working poor Americans by realizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you've got a child in the house, you will no longer be in poverty.
\
. . . Our next great goal should be strengthen our families. I compliment the Congress for passing the Family and Medical Leave Act as a good first step.
\
But it is time to do more. This plan will give this country the toughest child support enforcement it has ever had. It has time to demand that people take responsibility for the child they bring into this world.
\
And I ask you to help to protect our families against the violent crime which terrorizes our people and which our communities apart. We must pass a tough crime bill.
\
. . . And I support an initiative to do what we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. I will make you this bargain: If you pass the Brady bill, I'll sure sign it.
\
. . . Next, to revolutionize government, we have to ensure that we live within our means and that should start at the top and with the White House.
\
In the last few days, I have announced a cut in the White House staff of 25 percent, saving approximately $10 million. I have ordered administrative cuts in budgets of agencies and departments, I have cut the federal bureaucracy, or will over the next four years, by approximately 100,000 positions, for a combined savings of $9 billion.
\
. . . Tonight I call for an across-the-board freeze in federal government salaries for one year. And thereafter during this four-year period, I recommend that salaries rise at one point lower than the cost-of-living allowance normally involved in federal pay increases.
\
Next I recommend that we make 150 specific budget cuts, as you know; and that all those who say we should cut more be as specific as I have been.
\
. . . Some things work and some things don't. We ought to be subsidizing the things that work and discouraging the things that don't. I'd like to use that Superfund to clean up pollution for change and not just pay lawyers.
\
. . . But in the end, we have to get back to the deficit. . . . We have to cut the deficit because the more we spend paying off the debt, the less tax dollars we have to invest in jobs, in education and the future of this country.
\
And the more money we take out of the pool of available savings, the harder it is for people in the private sector to borrow money at affordable interest rates for a college loan for their children, for a home mortgage, or to start a new business. That's why we've got to reduce the debt, because it is crowding out other activities that we ought to be engaged in and that the American people ought to be engaged in.
\
. . . If we just stay with the same trends of the last four years, by the end of the decade the deficit will be $635 billion a year, almost 80 percent of our gross domestic product, and paying interest on that debt will be the costliest government program of all.
\
We will not be able to have the independence we need to chart the future that we must, and we'll be terribly dependent on foreign funds for a large portion of our investment.
\
This budget plan, by contrast, will by 1997 cut $140 billion in that year alone from the deficit, a real spending cut, a real revenue increase, a real deficit reduction, using the independent numbers of the Congressional Budget Office.
\
Well, you can laugh, my fellow Republicans, but I'll point out that the Congressional Budget Office was normally more conservative in what was going to happen and closer to right than previous presidents have been.
\
I did this so that we could argue about priorities with the same set of numbers; I did this so that no one could say I was estimating my way out of this difficulty; I did this because if we can agree together on the most prudent revenues we're likely to get - if the recovery stays and we do right things economically, then it'll turn out better for the American than we say.
\
. . . We're going to have to have no sacred cows except the fundamental, abiding interest of the American people.
\
I have to say that we all know our government has been just great at building programs. The time has come to show the American people that we can limit them, too, that we can not only start things, but we can actually stop things.
\
About the defense budget, I raise a hope and a caution. As we restructure our military to meet the new threats of the post-Cold War world, it is true that we can responsibly reduce our defense budget. And we may all doubt what that range of reductions is, but let me say that as long as I am president, I will do everything I can to make sure that the men and women who serve under the American flag will remain the best trained, the best prepared, the best equipped fighting force in the world, and every one of you should make that solemn pledge.
\
. . . I know this economic plan is ambitious, . . . and I think it is paid for fairly, first by cutting government, then by asking the most of those who benefitted the most in the past and by asking more Americans to contribute today so that all of us can prosper tomorrow.
\
For the wealthiest - those earning more than $180,000 per year - I ask you all who are listening tonight to support a raise in the top rate for federal income taxes from 31 to 36 percent. We recommend a 10 percent surtax on incomes over $250,000 a year and we recommend closing some loopholes that some people get away without paying any tax at all.
\
For businesses with taxable incomes in excess of $10 million, we recommend a raise in the corporate rate, also to 36 percent, as well as a cut in the deduction for business entertainment expenses.
\
Our plan seeks to attack tax subsides that actually reward companies more for shutting their operations down here and moving them overseas than for staying here and reinvesting in America. I say that as someone who believes that American companies should be free to invest around the world and as a former governor who actively sought investment of foreign companies in my state. But the tax code should not express a preference to American companies for moving somewhere else, and it does in particular cases today.
\
We will seek to insure that through effective tax enforcement foreign corporations who do make money in America simply pay the same taxes that American companies make (sic) on the same income.
\
To middle-class Americans who have paid a great deal for the last 12 years and from whom I ask a contribution tonight, I will say again, as I did on Monday, you're not going alone any more - you're certainly not going first, and you're not going to pay more for less as you have too often in the past.
\
I want to emphasize the facts about this plan: 98.8 percent of America's families will have no increase in their income tax rates, only 1.2 percent at the top.
\
There will also be no new cuts in benefits for Medicare.
\
. . . There must be plan cuts in payments to providers - to doctors, to hospitals, to labs - as a way of controlling health care costs, but I see these only as a stopgap until we can reform the entire health care system. . . . The only change we are making in Social Security is one that has already been publicized: the plan does ask older Americans with higher incomes who do not rely solely on Social Security to get by to contribute more. This plan will not affect the 80 percent of Social Security recipients who do not pay taxes on Social Security now. Those who do not pay tax on Social Security now will not be affected by this plan.
\
Our plan does include a broad-based tax on energy. And I want to tell you why I selected this and why I think it's a good idea. I recommend that we adopt a Btu tax on the heat content of energy as the best way to provide us with revenue to lower the deficit, because it also combats pollution, promotes energy efficiency, promotes the independence economically of this country as well as helping to reduce the debt, and because it does not discriminate against any area.
\
Unlike a carbon tax, it's not too hard on the coal states; unlike a gas tax, it's not too tough on people who drive a long way to work; unlike an ad valorem tax, it doesn't increase just when the price of an energy source goes up. And it is environmentally responsible; it will help us in the future as well as in the present with the deficit.
\
Taken together, these measures will cost an American family with an income of about $40,000 a year less than $17 a month. It will cost American families with incomes under $30,000 nothing because of other programs we propose, principally those raising the earned income tax credit.
\
Because of our publicly stated determination to reduce the deficit, if we do these things, we will see the continuation of what's happened just since the election.
\
. . . Unless we have the courage now to start building our future and stop borrowing from it, we're condemning ourselves to years of stagnation, interrupted by occasional recessions, to slow growth in jobs, to no more growth in incomes, to more debt, to more disappointment.
\
. . . Our people will be watching and wondering . . . whether we're all going to conduct ourselves as if we know we're working for them. We must scale the walls of the people's skepticism, not with our words but with our deeds.
\
. . . My fellow Americans, the test of this plan cannot be what is in it for me; it has got to be what is in it for us.
\
If we work hard and if we work together, if we rededicate ourselves to creating jobs, to rewarding work, to strengthening our families, to reinvesting our government, we can lift our country's fortunes again. . . . This must be America's new direction. Let us summon the courage to seize it.
\
Thank you. God bless America.
"
224,"In an effort to give voters more information about this year's statehouse races, the News-Leader is surveying candidates running for office this fall on top-of-mind state and national issues and publishing the answers.\Republican Alex Riley and Democrat Derrick Nowlin are the choices this fall for House District 134, which covers south-central Springfield, running from Bass Pro Shops to the James River.\The incumbent, Republican House Speaker Elijah Haahr of Springfield, is term-limited.\Here's how they answered the questions, with minor editing for length and style, in the order they'll appear on the ballot.\How old are you?\Riley: 28 years old.\Nowlin: 50 years old.\What do you do for work?\Riley: I am a business defense attorney and protect small local businesses, hospitals, doctors, nurses, and large businesses when they are sued. As someone who survived a battle with cancer in my teens thanks to an amazing medical community and as the son of two nurses, I particularly enjoy defending our community's medical heroes. I also love working with the business community to ensure our economy is able to move forward.\Nowlin: I work for a local sign company and have for the last 8 1/2 years. I design site plans and layouts for builders and construction companies to use when placing signs for a company. I also obtain the permits needed for placing the signs. Prior to my current job, I worked in the surveying/engineering field for over 20 years. I ran a survey crew, did project management, contract administration, and project inspection. A large part of the work I have done over the years has been on public projects such as roads, bridges, and infrastructure. It is a point of pride that for much of my career I have been helping to improve the infrastructure we use every day.\Why are you the best candidate for your district?\Riley: I was born and raised in Springfield, have lived in the 134th District for 20 years, and other than a few semesters away for law school, have lived in Springfield my entire life. I love our city and state dearly and want Springfield to be the best place possible to raise a family.\As a business defense attorney, I utilize the law every day to protect our state's job creators, innovators, and businesses. Because I work with and argue the law every day, I understand the lawmaking process and will be ready to hit the ground running working for my district from day one. My courtroom experience and multiple cases I have presented to Missouri's appellate courts have prepared me to face the toughest situations and stand strong on my conservative values and convictions.\My three main legislative priorities are to protect life, defend liberty, and foster prosperity in Missouri.\Nowlin: I grew up in Springfield and have spent most of my life here. This is my home. I am running because there is a deep chasm between what the state legislature passes and what the people in my district need. For instance, during this year's shortened session, these are just some of the bills that passed:\repealing part of helmet requirements for motorcyclists;\limits to liability lawsuits where plaintiffs must prove they were ""intentionally harmed"" before they can be awarded punitive damages; and\protections against licensing fees for payday lenders.\Of course, they passed some bills that help the people of the state, but a majority of the bills passed do very little to protect the people in my district and across the state. I believe we can do better.\This is my second time running for this seat. I have knocked on many of my neighbors' doors and though we don't always agree, we are usually able to come to an understanding. I listen to the changes they believe need to be made in this state and they listen to my ideas. Together, I believe we can move our state forward. My goal is to make this state a better place for the people who live and work here. The government I believe in funds our public school system, protects our workers, and allocates funds to benefit the people, not just the corporations in our state.\What is your opinion of the state's response to the coronavirus outbreak thus far?\Riley: I appreciate the work done at the state and local level to expand hospital capacity, obtain necessary medical equipment like ventilators and PPE, and to expand testing as quickly as possible. However, I do not agree with some of the orders issued at the state and local level.\I think the ""Stay at Home"" orders were overbroad and an approach focused on helping those most vulnerable to COVID-19 would have been a better starting place. I do not believe it is government's place to decide which businesses are ""essential"" and allowed to remain open while deeming some ""non-essential"" and requiring them to close, thus picking winners and losers in the economy. It doesn't make sense to say people can shop at big box stores like Walmart, but they cannot shop at small local businesses or go to church.\Nowlin: The state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been woefully inadequate. Unfortunately, because the Missouri legislature failed to expand Medicaid as required by the ACA in 2010, our health care systems are severely understaffed and under-equipped to deal with this crisis. More importantly, the people who would have benefited most from this expansion are the hardest hit by COVID-19.\Some of our current legislators tried to pass bills that would have stopped utility shut-offs, evictions and foreclosure during this crisis, but those bills weren't even brought in front of the legislature for discussion. We are now seeing that about 30 percent of Americans are unable to pay last month's rent, meaning we may face a housing crisis as bad or worse than it was in 2007-2008.\We have done almost nothing to help the small businesses in our state financially recover and this will cause many more to close in the coming months. This is not only bad for the strength of our local economy, but it will also cause a further consolidation of business, which lessens worker power and choice for consumers. Finally, if the state had a strong and coherent policy from the beginning regarding stay-in-place orders, and mask-wearing, we would likely not be seeing the rates of infection rising like they are. When it comes to the government, where there is a will, there is a way, and our state government has shown it does not have the welfare of the people in mind through this response.\What will you do as a legislator to help the state recover from the outbreak moving forward?\Riley: To help the state recover economically, my focus will be on removing government red tape so Missouri's innovators have the opportunity to grow the economy. I want Missouri to be the most business-friendly state in the country so businesses can open and grow here. To do this, I will work with our local business owners (and aspiring business owners) to identify and eliminate harmful government regulations which prevent them from achieving their dreams. I will also fight for low taxes in Missouri so our people can keep and spend more of their hard-earned money in our local economy.\To help the state recover medically, I will work with our medical providers to ensure they have the resources necessary to treat COVID-19 patients. Additionally, I would like to recruit manufacturers of medical equipment to Missouri so we are not reliant on foreign countries like China for our medical supplies.\Nowlin: This pandemic has really opened our eyes to the need for trust in our public institutions and a stronger public health system. Right now, we are seeing the struggle between fake news and public health messaging, leading to a rise in cases. We need to work with our local health departments and hospital systems to build trust throughout our community. As a legislator, I think it would be incredibly helpful to sponsor events between the public and our health providers to minimize this trust deficit. It is important for public safety that our society can trust public health information and those on the front line working to come up with solutions.\People without insurance or with inadequate insurance who end up in the hospital due to COVID-19 are going to face a real crisis. Medical costs were a leading reason for people filing for bankruptcy before the pandemic, and it is likely to only get worse. The state and the federal government have an obligation to the people to pass legislation to help people avoid this problem. The first step is to expand Medicaid so more people are covered, then we must find a solution to help those who fall into the gap. We also need to restore the aid to families, disabled folks, veterans, and the elderly that have been cut in previous sessions.\What will you do as a legislator to minimize the impact of any economic downturn on the state budget?\Riley: First, I will work to reopen and relaunch our economy as quickly as possible. The best way for the state to raise revenue is through the benefits brought by economic growth. Eliminating job-killing regulations and ensuring we have low taxes in Missouri are keys to relaunching and improving our economy.\Second, I will push to cut wasteful spending and reallocate those dollars to high priority areas like education and infrastructure.\Third, I will oppose big, new, expensive government programs that will cost the state money we frankly do not have. During this time of economic uncertainty and decreasing tax revenues, now is a completely inappropriate time for big government spending projects.\Nowlin: This is a difficult question to answer, not because I don't have many policy ideas to help bring us out of this economic and public health crisis, but the session doesn't start until January 2021 and we have no idea what this downturn will look like in 2021. So let's start with some things we do know. We need revenue. We need to start by eliminating loopholes in our tax policy that only benefit big businesses. The LLC loophole was meant to give companies a break on taxes and encourage them to hire more people, but this hasn't happened. Next, we should raise taxes on large corporations and the ultra-wealthy. It's past time they contribute their fair share to help the state rise out of this downturn. Finally, it's important to lessen the stress on lower and middle-class families by creating an earned income tax credit. Many other things should be done like increasing SNAP benefits and funding to public schools, and work with cities and towns to help them assist struggling businesses in the community. We should also institute a Wayfair tax on online businesses.\Outside of helping individuals and families, we need to invest in our infrastructure and public safety net. Public works programs not only provide job opportunities but offer incentives for new businesses to come to the state and better mobility for businesses to expand.\Do you think calls for changes to the state's criminal justice system are justified? If so, why, and which changes do you support? If not, why not?\Riley: Certain reforms to the criminal justice system are justified.\First and foremost, however, I absolutely support our local law enforcement officers and am completely opposed to defunding the police. I support doing more to improve accountability and to make sure bad apples are not on our police forces. After all, no one hates bad cops more than good cops since they have to deal with the ramifications of bad cops' actions. I believe police body cameras are a good starting place and protect both our officers and the public they serve.\In regard to other criminal justice reform measures, I would support rolling back mandatory minimum sentencing requirements and considering alternative forms of punishment/rehabilitation depending on the crime. I would also like to see more of a focus in our correctional institutions on preparing those currently in prison to succeed and become contributing members of society upon their release.\Nowlin: I do think we need criminal justice reform, but not in the way that Governor Parson has been discussing recently. He signed a bill recently that takes this reform in the wrong direction. SB 600 expands what crimes are considered felonies, and removes the option of probation for others, among other changes. In short, it is punitive and does not address the causes of crime, such as poverty and desperation. In light of current police actions in the killing of George Floyd and Beonna Taylor, as well as many others, I believe we need to take a look at the way we police crimes and the role of public defenders. I think we need community oversight boards who can hold departments accountable and help change department policy. Police should be from the community, we need to increase training and standards for working officers and trainees, we need a federal database of police misconduct, and we need to fund programs (to) bring social workers into situations where their expertise may deescalate a situation without the need for police intervention. This would be a good start to improve faith in the communities police serve.\Unfortunately, for years, our budget for public defenders has been too small. This shortfall has led to our state not having enough public defenders and to each public defender lacking the time to thoroughly defend their clients. In Springfield's own court system, these issues have led to people waiting up to six months before getting an attorney, leading to overcrowding in jails. We are overburdening our criminal justice system and making it difficult for every citizen to receive a fair trial.\What will you do as a legislator to improve educational outcomes for Missouri students?\Riley: Too often, government applies a ""one size fits all"" approach to education. That approach is failing and does not account for the unique attributes of each student. A strong public school system is necessary and public schools may be the best choice for many, but they are not the best choice for all. For some, the best option may be home school, private school, or faith-based school. I support legislation which supports educational choice, educational innovation, and empowers parents/guardians to choose the best option for their students.\For post-high school education, we should encourage more students to go to community college or trade school and stop pushing every student into a four-year university. While universities are the right option for some, pushing all high school graduates into a university in which they will incur thousands of dollars in student loans hurts too many of our students.\Nowlin: Many of the issues facing public schools are due to a lack of funding. Missouri is ranked 45th in state funding for schools and nearly every year the legislator cuts more and more money from the system. This funding uncertainty makes it incredibly difficult for schools to buy books, hire teachers, offer additional training for teachers, or expand learning opportunities for students. We need a better funding formula for schools that is much more flexible and allocates more money to schools in lower socioeconomic locations.\Many Missouri teachers stay in Missouri because they love the state and their students. We also have a great retirement plan, but our teachers have one of the lowest starting salaries in the country. It is difficult for schools to recruit great teachers when they could easily choose a neighboring state to work in.\I also believe that increasing access to technical classes in high school is a way to not only help prevent some students from dropping out of school but also gives students the opportunity for a career path right after graduation. While college isn't for everyone, having skilled labor is important to our future economy.\On another front, we need to decide as a society that broadband internet is a necessity. We have seen through this crisis that being able to learn online is vital and outside of a pandemic, students still need to be able to study, research, and take college courses from home.\Do you support the proposal to expand Medicaid on the August ballot? Why or why not? (Editor's note: Both Riley and Nowlin answered this question before voters approved expansion Aug. 4.)\Riley: I oppose Medicaid expansion. The primary reason is it will cost the state money we simply do not have right now. While the federal government will initially pay 90% of the cost to expand Medicaid, that remaining 10% will still cost the state millions and millions of dollars. In many other states that have expanded Medicaid, the numbers of new enrollees have far exceeded projections — thus resulting in even higher costs to those states than originally believed. At a time when our state is experiencing decreased tax revenues due to COVID-19 and the governor has already withheld almost $450 million in government spending, adding many millions more in new spending with no way to pay for it is irresponsible. If Medicaid expansion does pass in August, the state will have to cut funding from other priorities (likely education and infrastructure) in order to pay for it.\Nowlin: I wholeheartedly support Medicaid expansion. Missourians deserve health care, and in the case of Medicaid expansion, they have already paid for it. There is no logical reason as to why our Republican-majority legislature has refused to accept the matching funds through the ACA. Since the ACA passed in 2010 we have been paying for the expansion whether it benefited the people in our state or not. So why has Missouri not passed it? There are multiple reasons why we should vote Yes on 2 on August 4th. First, the economic benefits would be huge, an estimated 16,000 jobs added, $39 million added back to the budget in the first year and $1 billion added back by 2026. This leaves out the effects on small businesses, but it would lessen their burden to provide health care to their employees as well.\Also, 230,000 more people would have health insurance when Medicaid is expanded. The effect of that alone can't be overstated, especially during this pandemic. Over the past two years, Missouri kicked over 100,000 eligible enrollees off the existing state Medicaid system. Most of those removed were children, putting their families in a very tough situation. (Editor's note: A senior Republican lawmaker told the News-Leader in January that tens of thousands of children removed from the rolls in 2018 and 2019 were likely still eligible for coverage, but no six-figure amount has yet been confirmed.)\This will also help strengthen our health care systems and help save the few remaining rural hospitals in the state. The overall outcome of expanding Medicaid is more jobs, more money in our state budget, and 230,000 Missourians will have health care. It is a win-win for Missouri families and the entire state.\How will you address concerns about the state's aging infrastructure?\Riley: Given the current situation with COVID-19, a down economy, and decreased tax revenues, we will have to get creative to find ways to fund improvements to our state's infrastructure. To do this, I will work to identify waste and excess spending in other areas of government. Infrastructure should be a priority and I would propose spending a large portion of the money previously wasted on other government escapades to instead be spent on infrastructure improvements. As we work to rebuild our economy and we start to see increased tax revenue as a result, I would like to see some of that additional revenue spent on infrastructure improvements as well.\Nowlin: The bulk of my career has been in the construction and maintenance of our state's infrastructure. I know firsthand the cost of neglecting roads, bridges and infrastructure. In 2018, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave Missouri a C- on their report. It means we have a lot of work to do in some areas like dams, roads, and waterways, while our bridges and railways fare a little better. Updating our systems for the future is important to do before a major failure takes place. When our roads, bridges, and utilities are well-designed, well-built, and well-maintained, it is good for business, good for the people, and good for the environment. A major benefit of building and maintaining infrastructure is increased employment with good jobs and the opportunity for more businesses to come to our state.\In 2018, there was a proposition on the ballot, that didn't pass, which would have increased the gas tax. A percentage of the money would have gone to infrastructure. A similar proposal would allow us to fund these necessary projects in the future.\What issue not mentioned so far do you plan to make a priority if you win your election? Why that one?\Riley: Protecting the freedoms that our forefathers fought and died for is certainly another priority of mine. As our national and state governments continue to grow, they continue to infringe on our liberties. Our freedoms such as our Second Amendment right to bear arms, our right to free speech, and religious liberties are continually under attack by too many in government. I will fight to protect our hard-earned freedom.\Nowlin: There are a few policies I plan to prioritize. It is important to finally pass MONA as housing and worker protections for the LGBTQ community are vital to the growth of our state. It is time to ensure that folks in the LGBTQ community cannot be fired or evicted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. (Editor's note: LGBTQ individuals can no longer be fired for their sexual orientation or gender identity thanks to a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, but they can still be evicted or barred from public accommodations.) This is only an extension of the same basic rights you and I enjoy.\The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that we need to reform how we vote in Missouri. The time has come for mail-in voting: if they can do it in other states, and in the military, we can do it here. These examples have shown that fraud is virtually nonexistent with mail-in voting and that the participation levels are increased. I would gladly sponsor a bill for mail-in voting. I will always support any attempt to increase the ability of people to exercise their right to vote.\I will end on the issue that is my guide in everything I do politically: we must get money out of politics. Multiple studies have shown that the impact of money in politics is to silence the will of everyday people. Clean Missouri, passed overwhelmingly by Missouri voters in 2018, is a good start, but I think we need to go further. I would propose that the next step would be to look into ways to keep dark money PACs out of state elections. These are unaccountable PACs that take untraceable money and use it to dictate what bills are brought to the floor and which candidates are elected.\What else should voters know about you?\Riley: Growing up, I always knew I wanted to serve my city, state, and country in some way. Throughout my childhood and teens, my plan was to serve in the military. Unfortunately, when I was 17, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma — a form of cancer. Because of this, I could not meet the military's physical requirements and had to change my plans. I ultimately tested out of 3/4 of my college credits while I was still in high school and graduated with my bachelor's degree when I was 19. I then took a job working at a local law firm for a couple of years before going to law school.\I have been married for 6 years to my beautiful wife and high school sweetheart, Ellen. We have a 16-month-old son named Mitchell, another little one due in early December, and a 100 pound Great Pyrenees named Teddy.\Nowlin: I was born in Springfield and have spent most of my life here. I went to school at MSU (formerly SMSU) and started a family here. Early on in my marriage, my wife and I were both finishing school when she became permanently disabled. This led to a downward spiral for our family, as she couldn't finish school. I had to quit school and go to work full-time to support us, often barely making ends meet. Added to this was the burden of large student loans for an education neither one of us was able to complete.\The struggle of wending our way through the health care system with no insurance was difficult, but the three years it took to finally get her on disability and SSI was worse. Doctors trying to relieve her pain prescribed a plethora of opioids, muscle relaxers and sedatives. After ten years, the strain proved too much and we divorced but remained the best of friends. She died one night nine years ago in her sleep due to the toxic combination of drugs she was still taking.\This reinforced to me how hard it must be for everyone else if it was this hard for two college-educated people who had unforeseen circumstances thrust upon them. I know that almost all the people in my district face similar trials daily. I worry about the futures of their children, as I do my own. I understand the effort it takes for many to get up every day and be the caretaker and the parent. I understand the exhaustion of trying to keep a roof over your head and food on the table. I will bring that experience with me to Jefferson City and be the voice for those often unheard by their representative. I would appreciate your vote on Nov. 3.\Austin Huguelet is the News-Leader's politics reporter. Got something he should know? Have a question?

225,"MISSOURI VOTERS' GUIDE\Residents in the St. Louis area will vote Tuesday to elect the state House of Representatives.\All seats are up for election. Representatives serve two-year terms. Besides the Democrats and Republicans, candidates from the Libertarian and U.S. Taxpayers parties are seeking some seats.\Representatives are paid $27,580 a year. They receive a weekly travel allowance and expenses for each day the Legislature is in session.\A representative must be at least 24, a registered voter in the state for two years and in the district for one. Under the state's term-limits constitutional amendment, those elected on Tuesday cannot serve after 2006.\Below are responses to questionnaires sent to candidates in contested races. They appear in ballot order. Under state law, the party of the governor - now a Democrat - goes first. Some questionnaire answers have been trimmed for length.\9th DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Sam D. Leake is unopposed\11th DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Phil Smith is unopposed.\12th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\BILL LUETKENHAUS\AGE: 36\HOME: Josephville\OCCUPATION: Journeyman plumber Eagle Plumbing Co.\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent, first elected November 1992; Josephville village trustee, 1989-1990; St. Charles County Western District Commissioner, 1991-1992.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? If given the privilege to continue representing the resident of the 12th District, I will continue, as I have since my first election, to support legislation to reduce the tax burden on working families of our state. I will also continue my efforts to expand and improve the highways and roads of our area, to reduce traffic congestion and improve safety for motorists and their families. In addition, I will continue to give top priority to my constituents' calls, letters and e-mail requests.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My legislative record demonstrates that I have delivered improvements and assistance to the residents of the 12th District. As state representative for the 12th District for six years, I have gained vast experience and understanding of how to solve constituent problems dealing with state, federal and local governments. With this experience and knowledge, I can quickly help my constituents with their requests. My legislative experience enables me to introduce legislation to help our area and achieve passage of this legislation.\REPUBLICAN\DAVID EARL WOODS\No Response received.\U.S. TAXPAYERS\STEVE THORNHILL\No Response received.\13th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\DALE SCHAPER\AGE: 50\HOME: Wentzville\OCCUPATION: Agri-business, Self-employed\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I would seek legislation to expedite transportation and highway safety concerns on Interstate 70 and Highway 40-61. Also of concern is the increased traffic count and safety needs of our connecting state roads to these major highways. I would also support legislation to improve the Missouri school foundation formula which penalizes hold-harmless, and growing school districts. The 13th Legislative District is one of the fastest growing districts in St. Charles County.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My committment and dedication to the communities, schools and people of my district speaks for itself. I have no other political ambition, except to be your 13th District state representative. My opponent has stated that he wants to be a career politician and move from being state representative to St. Charles County government or a higher state office. I only want to service the people of the 13th District as your state representative.\REPUBLICAN\JON DOLAN\AGE: 31\HOME: Lake Saint Louis\OCCUPATION: Security Consultant Interface Systems\POLITICAL CAREER: Elected state representative from the 13th District, November 1996\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I have and will continue to support meaningful tax cuts and spending reforms. I will work to obtain more state funding for our growing school districts and promote local control and real achievement. Finally, I will continue my success in making our much needed highway safety and capacity projects a reality.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I have a solid record of being informed on the issues, involved in my district and in touch with my constituents. Meanwhile, my opponent has run twice before, failed to come out on the issues and ran a highly negative campaign in 1996. I should be re-elected because I have kept my promises and will continue to get the job done.\LIBERTARIAN\TOM WAHL\No Response received.\14th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\JEFFREY ADAMS\AGE: 30\HOME: O'Fallon\OCCUPATION: Airframe mechanic Boeing Corp.\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I believe that we need to attract more businesses to our district that will pay a livable wage as well as benefits so that our citizens can work as well as live in our community. We must quit allowing insurance companies to dictate the coverage our citizens receive. Insurance executives seem to use bottom line methodologies to influence their decisions by reducing benefits and services in order to increase the profits of the company. As the population increases in our district, we need to begin planning for new roads and improvements to the existing roads to maintain residents' safety. We also need to ensure that the fire and police protection in addition to other services, such as water and sewer, keep up with the growing demands of the community. We must continue to support the education systems. I am also the Pro-Life candidate endorsed by the Missouri Right to Life.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: As part of the fastest growing area in Missouri, I believe that we need a more active voice in Jefferson City. I believe that our representative should address a wider range of problems and concerns facing our district. I am familiar with the political process having met with numerous U.S. and Missouri legislators in both Washington D.C. and Jefferson City to address issues affecting Missouri, including bringing and keeping jobs in Missouri, education and job retraining programs, and the need for health insurance reform. I will coordinate with the county and city officials within the district to promote legislation that will benefit our entire community. I want to stay in touch with residents and remain an active part of the community that I will represent. I will serve on fewer committees and spend more time addressing issues that will benefit our area. It is time our district had a voice in Jefferson City, not simply a vote.\REPUBLICAN\CINDY OSTMANN\AGE: 59\HOME: St. Peters\OCCUPATION: Legislator\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent; Served for 12 years on the Fort Zumwalt School Board, 1978-1990.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I will focus on four legislative areas that affect my district as well as all of St. Charles County. Transportation, education, law enforcement and taxes. I will continue: 1) to fight to see Page Avenue extension built and to see the expansion and upgrade of Highway 40/61 expedited. 2) To support education reforms and the funding needed for them to be implemented and successful. 3) To work to pass the three bills I filed last session that didn't make it through the process, two that protect children under the age of 13, and one ""bad check"" bill. 4) To seek a tax reduction package that will end the states' practice of ""over collection"" of taxes and spending of tax dollars to refund the over charges.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I have made responding to constituent inquires and needs my first priority, and that will continue to be my first priority. My experience and seniority puts me in a position to serve on key committees and to press for legislation that best serves my district. For example, as a member of the Appropriation Committee for Education and Public Safety, I have direct impact on the funding for education, the courts, the Highway and Water Patrol and Veteran Affairs. As a member of the Transportation Committee, I impact transportation issues.\15th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\THOMAS S. GREEN\AGE: 32\HOME: St. Charles\OCCUPATION: Accountant, temperature control electrician Guarantee Electrical Co.\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I will work effectively to accomplish the needed policies for the 15th District. Everyone wants improved educational training for their children so they will have a opportunity at a productive life. I will demand that our school districts receive their fair share of state revenues for education. I also will promote smaller class sizes and will remove violent and disruptive students from the classroom so everyone has a chance to learn. I will pass legislation that will give your doctor the right to decide what health care you need, not a HMO bureaucrat. I support legislation that will give protections to Medicaid and Medicare patients. I support the Page Avenue extension and will be looking beyond the expansion to secure approval of the needed side roads that will move traffic faster.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: Receiving an accounting degree from the University of Missouri and having practical experience from working in public accounting will help me bring fiscal responsibility to the 15th district. I will ensure that our district receive the most out of our educational and transportation tax dollars. I believe that public service means that you work to attain the most for the citizens of the district you are representing. I will work to help make the 15th District a safe and prosperous place to raise a family.\REPUBLICAN\JON L. BENNETT\Incumbent; no Response received.\16th DISTRICT\REPUBLICAN\RICH CHRISMER\AGE: 52\HOME: St. Peters\OCCUPATION: Account representative Liturgical Publications of St. Louis Inc.\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent; first elected November 1992. Re- elected 1994 and 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Eliminate failed education reforms and standards that have blocked student achievement in recent years. Keep focused on real academic excellence that challenges our children to reach the highest potential possible. Strengthen local control of education. Missouri has increased spending by $6 billion in the past six years - this is unacceptable. I will continue to offer legislation to decrease taxes and eliminate excessive spending on failed programs. I will also submit a House Joint Resolution for a vote of the people to freeze residential property assessments at current rates with reassessment only at the time of new ownership. Our justice system should be swift and fair for criminals with no plea bargaining for violent offenders. Continued support of the Page Avenue bridge and the expansion of Highway 94 are vital priorities.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I will continue to provide effective leadership on issues important to the people I represent. Personal communication and daily contact with constituents allows me a clear understanding of what is required of me. My legislation to eliminate state sales tax on food became law and fulfills a promise to the voters. As a member of the budget committee, my insistence of accountability of state spending and support measures are key to allowing my constituents to keep more of what they earn.\LIBERTARIAN\DEAN SCOTT HODGE\AGE: 34\HOME: St. Charles\OCCUPATION: Contract software engineer, self-employed\POLITICAL CAREER: Committeeman, Spencer Creek Township, St. Charles County; Committeeman, Northwest Township, St. Louis County.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? 1. Unconditional repeal of all real estate and personal property taxes; 2) Oppose and reverse ""School to Work"" legislation; 3) Immediate and permanent repeal of all income taxes; 4) Stop abortion 5) Establish father's rights; 6) Encourage better health insurance plans through less meddling in the insurance industry.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My opponent has demonstrated by six years' of votes that he believes he knows enough to determine what is best for every child and adult in the state. My opponent has supported various tax increases, to his credit he did promote sales tax reduction - he did not go far enough. I am not possessed of such arrogance. I trust adults to do what is best for their families. I believe that people and businesses should be free to look after themselves without the heavy hand of Jefferson City `guiding' them.\17th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\DON R. KISSELL\AGE: 44\HOME: St. Peters\OCCUPATION: Business owner, self-employed\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Solving our traffic congestion problems will continue to be my No. 1 priority. Knowing the delays that would cause on I-7O during repairs to the Blanchette Bridge, I worked hard to speed completion of Highway 370. Now I'm working to speed construction on the Page Avenue Bridge. As a former police officer, with 18 years of experience, I have been a leader in helping pass legislation to keep our children and neighborhoods safe. Crime is down because elected officials have taken a hard-line approach to repeat offenders. I helped increase the penalties for conviction of manufacturing dangerous methamphetamine drugs. Improving educational opportunity is a third major goal of mine. I supported Missouri's A-Plus Program (which the Orchard Farm School District took advantage of) which allows students graduating from the program state assistance to attend the first two years of college. WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: A major difference between me and my opponent is in whom we choose to represent. As a small businessman, husband, father and homeowner, I know the value of hard work and providing for our families I'm committed to protecting the interests of consumers and taxpayers. In an attempt to eliminate competition, the big banks decided to try to pass a law that would prevent you from joining a credit union of your choice. As your state representative, I sided with the credit unions against the banking giants to protect competition and fairness. I know how hard it is for retired persons to make ends meet on a fixed income especially when property taxes and assessments keep going up. In order to help seniors afford to remain in their own homes, I helped pass an increase in the Circuit Breaker Law, which allows for property tax rebates.\REPUBLICAN\BUDDY HARDIN\AGE: 35\HOME: St. Charles\OCCUPATION: Self employed probation counselor Mid-Missouri Court Services\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Detailed regular audits of the Missouri Department of Transportation to ensure that our transportation dollars aren't being wasted on overhead. Toughen penalties on drunk drivers who kill and maim. Provide help to police to provide resource officers to more schools to ensure the safety of schoolchildren. Push for a real end to the failed desegregation programs. Restore lower felony stealing thresholds. Ban all lobbyist gifts. I would also be a balanced voice for both business and labor issues, whereas my opponent received the second lowest business rating from the Chamber. I am a small business owner who has been a member of a union.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I can be a much more effective advocate for the people living in the 17th District because I have worked hard at being involved in our community while my opponent has not. I can utilize my relationships with our county executive, congressman, and senators to be an effective representative for the residents of my district. This team approach is what is lacking with our current representative. I am also not going to the Legislature to sponsor bills that will put money in my pocket, nor will I accept any gifts from lobbyists while I am serving as a representative of the people of St. Charles County.\18th DISTRICT\Republican incumbent Chuck Gross is unopposed\19th DISTRICT\REPUBLICAN\CHARLES F. NORDWALD\AGE: 43\HOME: Warrenton\OCCUPATION: Auctioneer, self-employed\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent; first elected 1992; re-elected in 1994, 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? My legislative priorities will remain focused on welfare reform and recipient accountability. Further accountability from the Missouri Department of Transportation for our state highway funds. Allowing the citizens of the state the right to vote on tax increases. Also, those other issues that provide for individual rights and freedoms. I will oppose those issues that further expand the intrusion of state government in our private lives.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: Because I am a lifelong resident, who not only lives here, but also works here in the 19th District and rural Missouri, I am committed to working with and serving my district's patrons so we can all enjoy the privileges of living here in mid-Missouri.\LIBERTARIAN\LISA HOFFMAN\AGE: 43\HOME: Bellflower\OCCUPATION: I.S. coordinator, cashier Doctor's Hospital\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I will strive to repeal the state income tax. Missouri can be an example of how adequate revenues can be generated without taxing Americans' incomes.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: Libertarians are the party of the 21st century, and we promote a reduction in legislation. We do not need more laws - we need better laws and a review of existing laws to determine their positive influence on social and economic influence. I will offer a new approach to ""business as usual"" within the state government.\57th DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent O.L. Shelton is unopposed.\58th DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Louis H. Ford is unopposed.\59th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\RON AUER\AGE: 48\HOME: St. Louis\OCCUPATION: Marketing representative Group Health Plan\POLITICAL CAREER: First elected state representative in 1977, and re-elected every two years; elected Democratic committeeman from the 9th Ward in 1992, re-elected in 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? A bill similar to House Bill 1823, which would create a Metropolitan St. Louis Growth Management Advisory Commission that would develop policy formation relating to regional planning and regional prosperity for a viable region.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: Experience and accessibility.\LIBERTARIAN\KEVIN BABCOCK\AGE: 35\HOME: St. Louis\OCCUPATION: Flight Service Manager, TWA\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? As a Libertarian, my main goal is to seek free-market solutions for the problems facing my district. Therefore, the only new legislation I would seek is repeal of some bad legislation previously enacted.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I'm giving the voters a choice, and a chance to vote for LESS government. My opponent, the incumbent for many years, is obviously offering more of the same. More government ""fixes"" for the problems caused by the last government ""fix.""\60th DISTRICT\Democrat Amber ""Holly"" Boykins is unopposed.\61st DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Paula J. Carter is unopposed.\62nd DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Charles Quincy Troupe is unopposed.\63rd DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Dorathea Davis is unopposed.\64th DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Robert ""Bob"" Hilgemann is unopposed.\65th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\DERIO GAMBARO\AGE: 42\HOME: St. Louis\OCCUPATION: Engineer, BRI Inc.\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? The legislation I would support would include: 1.) Legislation that would push for long-term solutions to crime, in particular revisions to the 1995 Juvenile Crime Bill that would promote respect for authority, and teach children that there are consequences for their actions. 2.) Legislation to provide quality choices in education by maintaining the magnet school system, developing charter schools and improving neighborhood public schools. 3.) Legislation to build strong and safe neighborhoods by encouraging reinvestment in homes and businesses. 4.) Legislation to encourage economic growth by providing small business incentives and more equitable and manageable taxation.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My successes in providing leadership in neighborhood stabilization, economic development, and negotiations give me the experience and tools necessary to take the 65th District into the new millennium. Examples of my past experience include. 1.) President of Hill 2000 Neighborhood Association. 2.) Top producing salesman for BRI, Incorporated, a supplier of industrial equipment. 3.) Board member of Pride Builds, an economic development strategy group. 4.) Former member of St. Ambrose Board of Education and Parish Council.\REPUBLICAN\DARREN WOODS\No Response received.\66th DISTRICT\Democrat Harry Kennedy is unopposed.\67th DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Patrick Dougherty is unopposed.\68th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\JAMES P. O'TOOLE\AGE: 40\HOME: St. Louis\OCCUPATION: Pipefitter and small business owner\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent, first elected 1992; reelected, 1994 and 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Since elected in '92, I have: 1) passed legislation to help homeless veterans; 2) make the PSC develop rules and regulations dealing with slamming and cramming; 3) co-sponsored legislation to make it more difficult for offenders to plead not guilty by reason of insanity to be released. I fought for meals on wheels and circuit breakers for the elderly.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: Have no idea what he {opponent} stands for. So I can keep serving the people of the 68th by supporting of passing legislation that makes a difference in their lives.\REPUBLICAN\STEVE MILLMAN\AGE: 33\HOME: Shrewsbury\OCCUPATION: Courier, Access Courier\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Lowering Taxes. According to the Tax Foundation in Washington, D.C., Missouri's working class tax burden has risen over 20 percent since my opponent took office. This is unacceptable and, if elected, I will work diligently to decrease the state budget and decrease taxes on Missouri's citizens and small businesses.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My opponent sat back and watched while the state government budget rose nearly $7 billion during his term in office. He should have used his position to make a serious effort to lower the taxes on Missouri's citizens instead of voting to increase state government spending. Reducing taxes is my highest priority.\69th DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Dana L. Murray is unopposed.\70th DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Russell C. Gunn is unopposed.\71st DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Rita D. Days is unopposed.\72nd DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Betty L. Thompson is unopposed.\73rd DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Timothy P. Green is unopposed.\74th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\THOMAS ""TOM"" GEORGE\AGE: 52\HOME: north St. Louis County\OCCUPATION: Electrician, vice president of Local 1, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union.\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Fight to have the Missouri Department of Transportation maintain the roads in North County. Also work towards providing St. Louis with more revenues for storm water infrastructure project. St. Louis generates the most money for programs, and we need to make sure we get our fair share.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I have been involved in the district with providing volunteer services, such as improving the lights and fields at Rosary High School. Being involved in CYC sports programs for youth. Attending fund-raisers for community activities. Organizing and personally sandbagging in the flood of 1993 and 1995. I enjoy having and raising a family in North County and want to ensure everyone has the same opportunities I have had.\REPUBLICAN\JOAN HENDRICK\AGE: 57\HOME: north St. Louis County\OCCUPATION: Self-employed, Hendrick Communications\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I oppose linking St. Louis and Kansas City school desegregation. Our schools and needs are dramatically different than Kansas City. I support legislation that will allow St. Louis to address post desegregation separately. We need greater local control and establish reasonable caps on administrative spending to guarantee more money for the classroom. A quality education should not be tied to geography or income. I support building state reserves to protect programs for our families from cuts when and if we have a weakened economy.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: State Government's greatest priority must be to encourage a solid education for all children, regardless of geography or income. My background as a teacher gives me the experience to address complex issues surrounding our schools and the ability to provide innovative answers to improving education. I am acutely aware of the concerns that working families and individuals face rearing children, providing them an education and protecting them from crime. I understand the concerns seniors face with health care and Social Security. I feel my experiences give me the background to address those critical family issues.\U.S. TAXPAYERS\DENNIS STEAR\AGE: 43\HOME: north St. Louis County\OCCUPATION: Bookstore manager, Family Bookstore, Jamestown Mall\POLITICAL CAREER: Republican precinct committeeman, 1984.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I will work for legislation which puts the control of education into the hands of parents and local school boards. Reversing the centralization of education can begin by rescinding Senate Bill 380 and House Bill 564, which support the federal School-to-Work Opportunities Act, a federal mandate which takes local control away from schools. The governor's executive order 95-11 must also be rescinded because he arbitrarily decided with that order that we would participate in the School-to- Work Act, without our input. I will also work for legislation which will make criminals responsible for complete restitution to their victims in property crimes and other forms of restitution to victims harmed in assaults, injury and capital offenses.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I am running because I am tired of politics as usual. A vote for either established party is a vote for more of the same party politics as usual. I favor lessor government at most levels which will reduce taxes, cut spending and decrease regulation. I favor parent and local school board controlled schools and not government education mandates. I want a criminal justice system that holds criminals liable for their crimes to the full extent of restitution of their sentence demands and nothing less than the maximum time served. I will work for real change for the citizens, not power for the party.\75th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\MARY M. HAGAN-HARRELL\No Response received.\REPUBLICAN\LOUISE BUTLER\AGE: 51\HOME: north St. Louis County\OCCUPATION: Retired elementary school principal\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I would propose legislation that would prohibit any member of the General Assembly from increasing their own salary or retirement benefits. We must take ourselves out of that equation so our constituents know that every bill or appropriation that crosses our desks will be evaluated by only two criteria: How does this effect my district? How does this benefit the state of Missouri? Second I want to find a replacement for the personal property tax.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: In the last session my opponent voted herself a 3 percent pay raise an 8.7 percent increase in her teacher retirement and a 34 percent increase in her legislative retirement - all of this while the North County area experienced an estimated 17 percent loss in jobs. The 75th District needs the strong dedicated leadership that I can offer. I will stay in constant communication with the municipalities and unincorporated areas within the 75th district to make sure that I am acting as their advocate in the state Legislature. I am committed to working for a healthy, stable and productive North County.\U.S. TAXPAYERS\LEE M. WOLLGAST\AGE:\HOME: Black Jack\OCCUPATION: Owner, Wollco Equipment Inc.\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? More legislation is not what voters desire and currently I am not planning new introductions. Missouri has an ample supply of laws on record today that violate the principles and intent of our founding fathers. I will seek to repeal or amend existing legislation as it comes before the Congress in an effort to make it agree with the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Special attention will be given to existing legislation that pertains to right-to-life, education, taxes, crime and gambling. I will oppose all state legislation that surrenders Missouri rights to Washington bureaucrats as a condition for participation in federal programs.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I should be elected over my opponents because I am the only candidate pressing for a return of government to the principles established by our founding fathers. Elected officials are sworn to uphold the Missouri and the U.S. Constitution. They do not swear to meet the demands of every voter or special interest group. I will serve the 75th District by attempting to meet the needs of the people while preserving the integrity and safeguards of our founding documents. I will not make everyone happy, but all voters can be confident that Lee Wollgast will work to end the current erosion of our liberty and the disregard for the principles contained in our founding documents.\76th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\LANA LADD STOKAN\AGE: 40\HOME: Florissant\OCCUPATION: State Representative State of Missouri\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent, first elected, Nov. 1994, re-elected, 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? If re-elected to the state Legislature, I will continue to fight for my community here at home and in Jefferson City. I will continue to work with local officials on issues of neighborhood stability. I will persist in the fight to stop tax subsidies to developments in wealthy areas through tax increment financing. My leadership role on long-term care issues will continue. I will work to change our laws to better meet the needs of an aging population. I am committed to helping older adults remain independent and in the least restrictive setting as long as possible. I will continue to stand up against the abuse of the elderly in nursing homes and for good quality care. My visits to classrooms speaking to children about government will continue as well as informational talks to adult groups.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: For the last four years I have worked hard to protect the priorities of this district. I have a proven track record of helping pass legislation that affects our community positively. I have assisted thousands of people with their problems by helping them cut through government red tape. I listen to the needs and concerns of the people in our community and have represented them well in Jefferson City. I am a tireless worker for the people of this district and will continue to be so.\REPUBLICAN\ROBERT E. ""BOB"" HAGAMAN\AGE: 64\HOME: Calverton Park\OCCUPATION: Retired\POLITICAL CAREER: First elected to the Calverton Park board of trustees, 1989, re-elected, through 1997.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I will work to do the following, if elected: Revise the tax structure so that residents are not penalized for maintaining or improving their homes; reduce the amount of subsidized housing being located in North County; prepare recipients of subsidized housing for living in an area prior to moving them in so they and the neighborhood can all benefit; increase local control of our schools.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I have 10 years experience as a local elected official, membership in the Mayors of Small Cities, member of the St. Louis County Municipal League, and service on several boards. This gives me a background useful in guiding interaction between the state government and the needs of North County. We especially need help to improve the misguided image and treatment of our area. I have also been a business owner, production worker and manufacturing supervisor, so I am aware of the needs of all types of workers.\77th DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent David L. Reynolds is unopposed.\78th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\CAROL STROKER\AGE: 53\HOME: Hazelwood\OCCUPATION: State representative\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent, elected 1996; Hazelwood council member, 1992-1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? As a legislator, my top priorities are the economic viability of North County and preserving the quality of life for families who live in the community. I have worked diligently with the people who educate our children, run our municipalities, and operate the businesses in Hazelwood and Florissant. My goal is to make state government an asset to the community by: working to ensure safe schools; Improving educational programs in early childhood development; focusing on improving literacy rates within the primary grades; raising academic standards; continuing to work with law enforcement on community oriented policing to secure safe streets; continuing to support health care access for our families.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I am a dedicated, productive representative, who takes a common-sense approach to legislation. Sponsored legislation to increase penalties for domestic violence offenders that became law August 28, 1998. Named outstanding freshman legislator by the Missouri Police Chiefs Association for sponsoring legislation to protect police officers who are injured while making off-duty arrests. Strong supporter of education and was appointed vice-chair of the Elementary and Secondary Education Committee. Brought about crosswalks and traffic signals near local schools to provide safety.\REPUBLICAN\MICHAEL J. REID\AGE: 43\HOME: Hazelwood\OCCUPATION: Research and development, Benjamin Ansehl Co.\POLITICAL CAREER: State representative, 1991-1992; state senate, 1992-1994.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Creating jobs and economic growth should be our highest priority. The year 2000 computer problem could lead to severe consequences for our global economy. We cannot afford to have disruptions in state services or public utilities because of y2k related computer failures. We need to work to ensure that the state is doing everything it can to meet this challenge. Targeting educational resources so that all children learn to read in kindergarten and first grade will also be a high priority. I will sponsor legislation to make health care more affordable by providing tax deductions for people who need health insurance.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: Leadership includes looking to the future, being proactive, and solving problems before they get bigger. In 1993, I sponsored and passed legislation to create scholarship and fellowship programs for young women and men pursuing education in math, science and foreign languages - areas vital to our economic future. In 1994, I sponsored and passed legislation that made people with severe disabilities eligible for the circuit breaker property tax credit.\79th DISTRICT\Democrat Patrick J. O'Connor is unopposed.\80th DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent John J. Hickey is unopposed.\81st DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent James Michael Foley is unopposed.\82nd DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\SUE MEREDITH\AGE: 52\HOME: west St. Louis County\OCCUPATION: Staff, Webster University\POLITICAL CAREER: Elected as a director of the Ritenour School District, 1982; re-elected, 1986.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I would seek legislation to promote more patient choice in physician and other health care options in managed care. My goal is to provide opportunity for the most appropriate health care for the individual patients. I fully support the extension of affordable Medicaid coverage to families without health care. In the area of education, I would work to provide teachers with the tools and support that they need to manage and teach their classes. We need to find ways to encourage parents to take more personal responsibility, and to participate more fully in their children's education.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I have the education and experience to understand the issues presented, sort out the cause and effect of legislation and meet the demands of an elected legislator. I also have the ability to communicate with people from diverse backgrounds and philosophies. I believe that the voters want to know where their representative stands on the issues. They deserve direct, honest answers without partisan rhetoric. I'm willing to take the risk to give candid answers to the voters because the people the of the district deserve my respect and trust in their judgment.\REPUBLICAN\DAVID L. LEVIN\AGE: 49\HOME: west St. Louis County\OCCUPATION: Electrician, Bell Electrical Co.\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent, elected 1994, re-elected 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Continue to work to empower individuals and families through: tax reduction/breaks (e.g. real property and income tax, day care expenses); assure access to quality and affordable health care (out-of-pocket expenses for purchasing health insurance a 100 percent tax credit) while holding those making health care decisions accountable; reverse federal and state takeover of our schools (local control); raise education standards of safety, quality, fiscal responsibility, competition and accountability to parents; increase state funding to our district's schools (frozen at 1993 levels since 1993); meaningful and compassionate welfare reform; keep violent criminals off the streets regardless of age; protect privacy of families, consumers and public; local control of billboards and reverse T.I.F. abuse.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: In Jefferson City we have a philosophical contrast between empowering people versus government. Giving tax breaks to empower people versus the second fastest growing state budget in the country with $1 billion per year budget increases since 1993. Missouri is the only state where the percent of personal income required to pay state and local taxes has increased over 20 percent since 1992. The average Missourian must work until the middle of May to earn enough money to pay all their taxes. My opponent and I represent this philosophical contrast in Jefferson City of empowering people versus government. I request the privilege to continue the battle and to represent and serve my neighbors in Jefferson City.\LIBERTARIAN\MARK R. KAUFMANN\AGE: 36\HOME: Maryland Heights\OCCUPATION: Unemployed\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I would seek legislation that ensures that never again will a public park, such as Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park, having extensive natural areas and abundant wildlife, face the threat of irreversible destruction and permanent ruination by any public project, such as the proposed 10- lane Page Avenue extension superhighway. Further, all spending of taxpayer funds for a project should be halted when there will be a public vote on the project, such as Page Avenue.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I have become convinced that government has run amok in general, unlike my opponents. With my education - doctorate in physics - breadth of knowledge in many varied subjects, and common-sense approach to issues, I would stress the freedom of the individual over the power of government, except in the case of our long-term effects on our environment, where laws need to be strengthened.\83rd DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\BARBARA FRASER\AGE: 51\HOME: University City\OCCUPATION: High school history teacher, Mary Institute and Country Day School\POLITICAL CAREER: Elected director of University City School Board, 1983; re-elected 1986, 1989 and 1992.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? If elected, I seek to: 1) Insure equal access to the best quality education from pre- school to graduate school. 2) Create a vibrant community, which promotes a sound business environment. 3) Protect all citizens' rights to independence and quality of life by supporting health care choice and access to adequate health insurance coverage.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: Twelve years of elected public service as a community school board member; a career based on teaching the principles of our government; proven leadership in early childhood advocacy. Voter registration, as a St. Louis Symphony volunteer and subdivision trustee, a lifetime commitment to democratic ideals. I am committed to a system of educational excellence that results in productive and responsible citizens. Education and business must be partners to maintain and encourage growth in Missouri. Investment in research and technological resources in schools. Colleges and universities will support and attract business in Missouri. I believe in honest government which is dedicated to protecting the citizens of Missouri by effective self-monitoring.\REPUBLICAN\GRETTA FORRESTER\AGE: 60\HOME: Clayton\OCCUPATION: Business Crosby Corp., Intoximeter, Inc.\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Education: Maintain strong public, private, and parochial schools, strengthen weaker schools and hold all schools accountable for ensuring the achievement of their students; provide the necessary resources to ensure achievement for our most at-risk students. Economic growth and job creation. Make Missouri a more business-friendly state by lowering taxes and adopting other policies to attract business and keep business in the state. Good government: promote and practice honest, cost-effective government; reform campaign finance laws to make elected officials accountable to the people instead of special interest groups. My campaign is accepting money only from individuals (no institutions, PACs, unions, etc. and adhering to the no longer required state contribution limits.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I am an experienced leader with a strong and broad background of community and public service - local and statewide, including the appointments to the Missouri State Cancer Commission by Gov. Kit Bond, serving from 1982-1989; appointed to the Missouri Community Service Commission by Gov. Mel Carnahan, January 1998; currently serve on the Missouri Humanities Council. Other community involvement includes: service on the boards of the United Way and the Girl Scout Council of Greater St. Louis, chairing the boards of KETC Channel 9 and the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis; appointment to the Fordyce II Leadership Summit on Racial Polarization in 1990.\84th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\JOAN BRAY\AGE: 53\HOME: University City\OCCUPATION: Legislator, State of Missouri\POLITICAL CAREER: First elected state representative, November 1992; re-elected 1994 and 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I will be working with the executive branch on implementing the Rebuilding Communities legislation I passed last session. I will continue to seek a total transportation policy for the state and equitable funding for all modes of transportation. I will work to have more rational tax policy and tax laws.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I have been effective in my three terms in office responding to the needs of my constituents and the communities I represent. I have achieved a leadership position as chair of the Ways and Means Committee that enables me to have an impact on important issues.\REPUBLICAN\ALEXANDER HASLER\AGE: 35\HOME: Richmond Heights\OCCUPATION: Marketing director, Water Wholesaler\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? 1) Enforcing the laws of the Missouri State Constitution over our state government. 2) Eliminating government fraud, waste and abuse. 3) Lowering taxes, with less big government and regulations on businesses. 4) Implementing real welfare reform with private charities, churches, shelters and local neighborhood volunteers helping the poor and impoverished. 5) I am for freedom in education, parents should have local control over curriculum and the management of education, not the federal and state government.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My opponent is for more and increased government regulations which restricts our family and individual freedoms. I am for economic development through less government regulations and taxes. My opponent is for legalizing sodomy and for population control schemes such as abortion and euthanasia. My opponent is for increased governmental control over our children's education.\85th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\CHRISTOPHER A. ""CHRIS"" LIESE\AGE: 35\HOME: Maryland Heights\OCCUPATION: Owner of a benefit and financial consulting firm, Liese and Associates\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent; First elected state representative, November 1992; re-elected in 1994 and 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? 1) Protect school funding resulting from reduced gambling taxes due to closure of riverboat casinos (depending on the outcome of the statewide November ballot); 2) No cost, no credit senior college program that allows seniors to audit college courses in their community after registration is closed and excess classroom seats are available; 3) Campaign finance reform to restrict the use of soft money in elections; 4) More prevention programs to stop juvenile crime and gang violence 5) Increased safety programs for children at school; and 6) Expanded drug prevention and education programs.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I have a proven record that demonstrates my commitment to the voters in this district. Valuable experience and seniority have helped me to effectively represent their views in the Missouri House for the last six years. I am asking the citizens of the 85th District to re-elect me so I can continue to work for legislation to improve the quality of life for all Missourians. I am proud to have supported and passed this kind of legislation that includes targeted tax cuts, improved educational funding, expanded access to health care, welfare reform, ending early parole for criminals and longer sentences for producers and sellers of methamphetamine or ""meth"" drugs.\REPUBLICAN\DON DOSSER\AGE: 52\HOME: west St. Louis County\OCCUPATION: Business economist and financial manager; Retired from Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Missouri expenditures have grown 74 percent in the last six years, with the average per- capita tax rate going up faster than the other 49 states. If elected, I would work to achieve fairer and lower taxes by: a) eliminating the $10,000 limit on federal tax deductions on state returns; b) providing the same state tax deduction for parents at home, as those who send children to day care; c) eliminating personal property tax for those on fixed income and phasing it out for everyone else, to be replaced with a more equitable revenue source for schools, fire districts and other taxing entities. I would work to bring fundamental academic and financial control of local schools back to parents, teachers and administrators, along with providing educational options. The criminal records of juvenile offenders should be available to schools and local authorities. I would propose legislation to fund earlier completion of Missouri Highway 141 from Ladue Road to Interstate 70. I would also oppose legislation taking away individual constitutional rights, including the 2nd Amendment and those of the unborn.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: With my five years as a union member with the Teamsters, two years as a communications worker, then 28 years as a business economist and financial manager, I have broad experience in many areas including legislative work in Washington and Jefferson City. Along with my 21 years of community involvement in this district, I am the strongest individual for the job. I will not vote for house leadership who control the legislative agenda to the moral and financial detriment of the families of my district.\86th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\LEONARD HYMAN\AGE: 62\HOME: Chesterfield\OCCUPATION: Retired public high school teacher; owns and operates Len's Collectibles, a small antique business.\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I would seek legislation that would keep Parkway and other public school districts strong; reduce crime and keep our neighborhoods safe, and keep our taxes low.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I should be elected rather than my opponent because I better represent the moderate views of the vast majority of the voters of my district. I will be able to get things done. My opponent has not had even one of his bills signed into law in 10 years.\REPUBLICAN\TODD AKIN\AGE: 51\HOME: Town and Country\OCCUPATION: Legislator, Missouri\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent, first elected, November 1988; re- elected 1990, 1992, 1994 and 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Over the past six years, Missouri has moved from 47th in state and local taxes to 16th, and our rate of tax growth is first out of 50 (states). As ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means committee, I will work to significantly cut our unconstitutional tax burden.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My background is unique and has helped me be effective in the legislature. I have a bachelor's degree in engineering, a master's degree, I've been an officer in the Army, worked in business management with IBM, and taught international marketing at college. Over the past several years, I have help author a tax limitation amendment to our constitution which passed; passed a bill to fix a problem with the new Roth IRA; and taken the lead in regulation of casinos. If re-elected, I will continue to work hard.\87th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\JOHN ROSS\AGE: 38\HOME: Brentwood\OCCUPATION: Technician AT&T\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I will push for legislation that will benefit our children and our senior citizens; legislation that will improve our schools, our roads and our economy in general will keep our district the shining example of St. Louis County. I will fight for workers' rights every chance I get.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I will build upon, rather than tear down, the fine programs that our state legislature passed in the last session: children's safety; health care; and college loan programs, just to name a few. I will help insure that women's rights are also preserved in the state of Missouri.\REPUBLICAN\CATHERINE L. HANAWAY\AGE: 34\HOME: Glendale\OCCUPATION: Political adviser, Missourians for Kit Bond\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Missouri must stop collecting taxes in excess of the constitutional limits only to later spend money to calculate and then send refunds. I support legislation that would bring us under the limits through lowering property taxes, restoring full deductibility of federal income taxes, or eliminating the personal property tax. St. Louis has been losing the nationwide competition to retain and attract corporate headquarters. I will aggressively pursue legislation that improves Missouri's ability to compete for these jobs.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: Because values count and experience matters. I value local control of schools, free enterprise and strong neighborhoods. I believe my experiences have prepared me well to be an effective advocate for the people of the 87th District. For the past four years, I served St. Louisans as Sen. Kit Bond's chief staff person in St. Louis, working on almost every issue of regional significance. I am an attorney and practiced law at Peper, Martin. Volunteerism has been a major part of my life - including service on the Hope House Board of Directors, as a past President of the Jaycees and as a member of the Junior League.\LIBERTARIAN\MATTHEW W. PETERS\AGE: 44\HOME: Richmond Heights\OCCUPATION: Investment adviser, self-employed\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? My first priority is to break the federal leviathan's grip on Missouri's public schools. As long as Washington is involved, government schools will fail to improve their product. Failure results too as the education elites focus more on administration, counseling and physical facilities than on student learning. The family suffers under the current arrangement and the Stupid Party (the right) nor the Evil Party (the left) has the courage to say enough is enough. Education is far too important to remain in the hurtful hands of the NEA and government agents. Put parents in charge through a no-strings-attached tax credit or vouchers and let us begin now to save the next generation of Missouri public school children. As has been so well said before ""a mind is a terrible thing to waste.""\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: First, I am not a lawyer. Second, my campaign is purposefully spending under $500. Therefore I will be free to introduce a common-sense, `undo the damage' bill which is untouched by the seductive web of special interests who control the multibillion-dollar state budget. Third, the correct questions are not being asked by the establishment Demipublican Party; a truly independent, second party member like me, who will ask the tough questions and make the proper decisions for maximum personal and economic liberty.\88th DISTRICT\Republican incumbent John Loudon is unopposed.\89th DISTRICT\Republican incumbent William ""Bill"" Linton is unopposed.\90th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\RICHARD K. ""RICK"" JOHNSON\AGE: 29\HOME: High Ridge\OCCUPATION: Lawyer, Johnson & Johnson law firm\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? 1) Revamp health care to put doctors and patients in charge of medical decisions, rather than insurance companies; the ethics of medicine should control health care, not the ethics of business. 2) Procure my district's fair share of transportation monies. 3) Protect education, and direct more funding toward schools in my district. 4) Remove sales tax on new vehicles as a means to comply with the Hancock Amendment.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I better represent my district than does my opponent. I am more in touch with the many problems we are experiencing. My opponent has already served four terms (eight years) in the House; my district supported term limits, my opponent does not. Fighting for others is what I do best. This district is changing rapidly and we need leaders best prepared to handle progress. I will make this office one of community service, not politics.\REPUBLICAN\BILL ALTER\AGE: 54\HOME: High Ridge\OCCUPATION: Consulting and management, Alter Management Co. Inc.\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent; first elected in 1988, elected, 1992; re-elected, 1994 and 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? The citizens of my district (parts of Jefferson and St. Louis counties) have similar concerns to others in the area. With the exploding population in my district, crime is still a major concern. As ranking Republican on the Criminal Law Committee, I will continue to focus on making our neighborhoods safe for families. Families are being taxed at higher and higher rates, while government waste and needless bureaucracy continue to grow. Better health care availability is a major concern. Improving transportation, especially Highway 21, is a priority.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My conservative views are a much better representative of my district than the liberal agenda of my opponent. Eight years experience and important committee assignments put me in a good position to provide needed results. My background of running a small business, of raising a family, and in law enforcement put me in touch with the everyday challenges and concerns of the people I represent.\91st DISTRICT\Republican incumbent Emmy Mcclelland is unopposed.\92nd DISTRICT\Republican incumbent Brent Evans is unopposed.\93rd DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\CECIL SHARP\AGE: 60\HOME: Manchester\OCCUPATION: Retired Teacher\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? A representative district must be viewed as a collection of people. Such a district is best served by seeking and trying to implement the wishes of its people. People want health care management organizations to be better regulated to protect patient rights. They want to know that their schools are places where students and their teachers can pursue learning without disturbing influences. As a classroom practitioner for 30 years and having conversed with colleagues nationwide, I know that it is not cost effective and just plain bad policy for teachers to have to spend inordinate amounts of time attempting to get some students to do what should be done as a matter of student responsibility. If the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will not use its regulatory powers in this area, then legislation is needed.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I believe the incumbent's votes too often do not reflect the wishes of constituents. Examples are opposition to regulating HMOs, opposition to extension of health insurance to 90,000 additional Missouri children, opposition to a revised Workers' Compensation measure after that measure was negotiated and endorsed by business leaders, and opposition to a requirement for auto makers to inform dealers if a car has been damaged and repaired.\REPUBLICAN\PATRICIA ""PAT"" SECREST\No Response received.\94th DISTRICT\REPUBLICAN\MICHAEL R. GIBBONS\AGE: 39\HOME: Kirkwood\OCCUPATION: Lawyer, Gibbons & Gibbons, P.C.\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent, first elected November 1992; re- elected 1994 and 1996; Kirkwood City Council Member, elected April 1986; re-elected April 1990.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I will seek broad- based income tax reduction. State revenue has increased by $1.7 billion in the last 3 years of which $700 million has been required to be refunded under the state constitution. We should revise our income tax to a truly flat tax, increase the personal exemptions and reduce the rate to achieve this reduction. I also plan to reintroduce legislation to allow our cities to enforce prohibitions against minors in possession of tobacco products.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I am a fourth generation resident of Kirkwood and I have been active in this community all of my life. I have the experience, qualifications and dedication to best serve the needs and interests of this district. Finally I am committed to doing all that I can to leave my corner of the world a better place.\LIBERTARIAN\GARY S. GERSTENECKER\AGE: 30\HOME: Kirkwood\OCCUPATION: Research scientist, Monsanto Company\POLITICAL CAREER: Elected Libertarian committeeman from Bonhomme Township, 1998\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? First, to get ""None of the Above"" added to the ballot in every race in Missouri so that incumbents are not automatically re-elected. Next would be legislation for Missourians to opt out of the bankrupt Social Security system, an overall reduction in tax burden by streamlining state services, the elimination of the improper usage of tax increment financing (TIF) by eliminating its right of eminent domain, and finally a restoration of individual and personal freedoms for everyone\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: If I weren't running in this election, the voters in my district would have no opportunity whatsoever to express dissatisfaction with the incumbent. I should be elected because I am not afraid to run against ""None of the Above"" in an election. I am not a career politician. I don't plan to be a career politician. Once elected, I plan on doing the ""Right Thing"" in every decision. I will not base any decisions on ""What will get me re- elected?"" I am vice-chair of the St. Louis County Libertarian Central Committee.\95th DISTRICT\Republican incumbent Jim Murphy is unopposed.\96th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\JOSEPH L. TREADWAY\AGE: 51\HOME: Lemay\OCCUPATION: Special projects coordinator, Centenne Corp.\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent, first elected, November 1982, re- elected 1984, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994 and 1996; director, Lemay Fire Protection District, 1981-1983.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Expansion of the current law which allows individuals and neighborhood associations legal standing and damages against property owners who do not keep their property to the minimum housing code. Also, tax credits for certain economically less affluent areas of St. Louis city and county. Those tax credits would be given for renovation of real property.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I have the experience and have made a difference in the quality of life of my constituents and will continue to work toward this goal. My opponent has only lived in the area for approximately two years and, frankly, I have not seen any community participation by him other than partisan political events.\REPUBLICAN\MICHAEL A. O'DONNELL\AGE: 30\HOME: south St. Louis County\OCCUPATION: Municipal bond trader, A.G. Edwards & Sons\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I would seek to reduce income taxes for all taxpayers in my district and the state. The state budget has almost doubled since 1992, increasing the budget by over $1 billion dollars per year. It would take $600 million to $700 million of that $1 billion increase to give all taxpayers in the state a 0.5 percent cut in their income tax rate, that is what my district needs, tax relief.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My opponent has had sixteen years to bring tax relief to the citizens of the 96th district, but has instead voted to increase the size of the state budget by $1 billion per year, year after year. This has caused the state budget to go from $8.8 billion in 1992 to $15.9 billion in 1998. The people I've been talking to while going door-to-door in my district do not believe their services have improved, much less doubled in the last six years. They feel they just have a bigger, slower and less responsive bureaucracy to pay for. The voters of my district are ready for a change, a change to common-sense management in state government. I want the people of the 96th district to decide how to spend their hard-earned money; my opponent thinks the state knows best.\97th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\CARL T. KLEUSCH\AGE: 65\HOME: south St. Louis County\OCCUPATION: Retired, Boys Scouts of America\POLITICAL CAREER: Elected Democratic committeeman of Tesson Ferry Township, August 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? The legislation I would seek for the people of my district reflects their concerns and goes beyond the 97th District to affect all Missourians. The top priority is health care, making it more accessible and covering more individuals. I support banning the ""gag rule"" on HMO doctors, ensuring patients can choose which doctors they see, and limiting the ""gate keeper"" practice. Equally important is legislation to promote quality education in safe schools by removing disruptive students from classes, offering intervention programs, and providing high instructional standards which promote ""job-ready"" graduates. As for the 97th District itself, I would target several dangerous roads in the area and promote road and bridge repairs.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My opponent has had four years to enact legislation to benefit the 97th, but sadly, has failed to pass a single bill or make a single improvement. I have a proven record of leadership and community service. Through my door-to-door campaign, I know I share the common concerns of a majority of voters and have already developed action plans to get the district moving forward. Three years ago I answered the call to successfully defeat incorporation. Since then, I have worked with (St. Louis) county government to protect residents from problems associated with over- development. I know I can accomplish much more for the people in my area as their representative in Jefferson City.\REPUBLICAN\CARL H. HENDRICKSON\AGE: 61\HOME: south St. Louis County\OCCUPATION: State representative, attorney and business consultant, and self-employed\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent; elected 1994, re-elected 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I again shall sponsor ""The Missouri Homestead Preservation Act"" to freeze assessments on senior citizens' property and to limit biennial assessment increases to others to inflation. I also propose (a) repealing the sales tax on non-prescription drugs, medical supplies and food, (b) terminating the state income tax on social security income, and (c) allowing the full deduction of federal income tax payments on state returns. Health care assistance will be provided by permitting a deduction on state returns of the cost of health insurance. Prosecutors will be given more legal tools to prosecute street gangs and stop the recruitment of members.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I have been an active member of the district for over 25 years. During these years, I have served as local scout leader, as a member of my church's governing council, and as a subdivision trustee. These many years of community involvement and service have provided valuable insight into the needs of the area's citizens. I have 30-years experience in the corporate world as counsel for a major company and as a business consultant. I know how to manage the business of government.\98th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\MAY SCHEVE\AGE: 34\HOME: south St. Louis County\OCCUPATION: State representative Missouri\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent; first elected 1990; re-elected 1992, 1994 and 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? In 1999, I plan to introduce a number of measures to improve the lives of our senior citizens. From stricter penalties for those taking advantage of seniors when soliciting home improvements contracts to assisting seniors with their prescription medicine costs. Also, I will push for legislation that provides tax credits for renovation costs on older homes in St. Louis County. The process of reassessing homes every two years has hurt many St. Louis County homeowners, and I would like to work on an alternative.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My strong record of passing legislation for our state's seniors, preschool children and citizens of unincorporated St. Louis County only touch an area of my proven commitment and legislative success. The district has benefited from my public service by having a full-time legislator who has produced a new community center, an economic development plan for the Gravois Business Corridor and constant improvement in the local schools, just to name a few accomplishments in my eight years in the Missouri House.\REPUBLICAN\RONALD E. LEVY\AGE: 69\HOME: south St. Louis County\OCCUPATION: Retired\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? If elected, I will sponsor four Missouri constitutional amendments: First - Abolish all property taxes on homes and cars imposed by all school districts throughout the state. State income has grown enough to replace school property taxes many times over. 2) Establish a state-funded education voucher system where all parents have control of where their children attend school with an equal amount of money. 3) Eliminate three- fourths of unneeded and costly 197 Missouri legislators whose pay is over nine times Nebraska's 49 legislators. 4) Phase-out in nine months of having Medicaid paying for 42 percent of Missouri childbirth's Thousands of Missouri babies are born into instant poverty with no responsibility assumed by the parents and taxpayers paying costs.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My incumbent opponent opposed the 1994 Hancock II constitution amendment that would have closed up the loopholes of the 1980 Hancock constitution amendment's tax limitation by the state. I worked very hard collecting over six months of signatures on a petition to place Hancock II on the ballot in 1994 only to have the governor destroy my effort at the polls and defeat the amendment with his negative propaganda. The governor still raised taxes $695 million without a vote in defiance of the 1980 Hancock I tax limitation and now has to refund the money to taxpayers. In my opinion the governor should resign and my opponent should not be re- elected.\99th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\CHRISTOPHER ""CHRIS"" KUBAN\AGE: 24\HOME: Green Park\OCCUPATION: Currently on leave of absence, Missouri Foundation for Fair Contracting\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? We need a representative who will put our kids first. I'll work for increased state funding for education and enhanced technology training so our kids will have the skills to succeed. When our area schools had the opportunity to receive $21 Million more from gaming boat revenue, for early childhood education, our representative voted no. She let the gambling interests off the hook and let our kids down (House Bill 1519). I believe property tax reassessment for residential property should be frozen till the property is sold. I also believe the state of Missouri should automatically calculate eligibility of senior citizens for property tax refunds under the Circuit Breaker Law rather than making people fill out a form each year.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: As your state representative, I will make property tax reform a top priority. I will not only introduce legislation to help homeowners and taxpayers, Traffic congestion is an increasing problem for commuters in and around St. Louis County. Parts of 270 resemble giant parking lots at rush hour. I support the extension of MetroLink to South County, better long-range planning and a fair distribution of highway funds based on population. We deserve our fair share of Missouri's highway dollars. Another major area of concern is health care reform. Decisions about health care matters should be between a patient and their doctor. Big insurance companies are trying to second-guess doctors.\REPUBLICAN\CATHERINE S. ENZ\AGE: 44\HOME: south St. Louis County\OCCUPATION: Homemaker\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent; elected 1994; re-elected, 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Freeze property taxes for those 65 years old and older, or limit increase to consumer price index. Propose a tax credit for families when a parent chooses to stay home to raise their child. Phase in immediate tax break for private pensioners, that government pensioners now receive. Deductibility of health insurance costs ""dollar for dollar"" on state tax return. Repeal all sales tax on food. For three years the state of Missouri has collected more taxes than our constitution allows. The Legislature has passed limited tax relief to avoid Hancock income tax refunds; next year significant tax relief should be passed to lighten the load of all overtaxed and hardworking Missouri families.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: The 99th District deserves a mature and responsible leader who has lived life's experiences as a homeowner, property taxpayer, and someone who knows how Jefferson City affects their family budget. I am not a government insider and will continue to challenge the bureaucratic inefficiencies of state government. As a Legislator, I have a proven lower-tax and smaller government voting record. I consider elected office public service, not a political opportunity.\100th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\JOAN BARRY\AGE: 57\HOME: Oakville\OCCUPATION: Registered nurse, St. Anthony's Medical Center\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent, elected in a special election, March 1996; re-elected November 1996.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I plan to continue working to keep Oakville a good place to raise a family. More improvements to our health care system, specifically in the area of patients' rights, is one of my main concerns. I also plan to continue fighting to ensure that our schools get their fair share of state funds and that they use those funds to provide our children with the kind of education they need. Another of my main goals is to secure the safety of our children by eliminating the dangerous drug known as ""meth.""\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My record speaks for itself. Since I have been in Jefferson City I have fought hard to improve the lives of people in my district and across the state, and if re-elected, I will continue doing just that. I have fought for tougher sentences for repeat offenders of domestic violence, I sponsored legislation guaranteeing women at least two days in the hospital after they've had a mastectomy, and I voted for several major tax cuts that make life a little easier for all Missourians. Having already spent over two years as your state representative, I know how the system works and I know how to get things done.\REPUBLICAN\DEBORAH L. ""DEBBIE"" WHEELEHAN\AGE: 44\HOME: Oakville\OCCUPATION: Officer manager, Traditional Congregation\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I would sponsor and/or support legislation which provides tax relief for the hard- working men and women of the Oakville community. I have continued my commitment in 1998 to the Americans for Tax Reform pledge - no new increases in taxes - that I took in the 1996 election campaign when I ran for U.S. Congress against Dick Gephardt. I will fight for high academic standards in education to assure our children are competitive in the 21st Century. In my conversations with local citizens. There must be greater accountability of monies spent consistent with the level of education our children receive. We must do everything within our power to safeguard our youth from illegal drugs, an escalating concern to all parents of school-aged children. I will support stringent criminal penalties for those convicted of selling drugs to our children.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: The differences between my opponent and me are many. I believe that legislators should be very reluctant to take more of our citizens' hard-earned money for a larger government bureaucracy. My opponent has a record of voting indiscriminately to raise the taxes of Oakville residents. Missouri's tax burden has ballooned by more than 20 percent since 1992, more than any other state in the nation. This hefty increase means Missouri's tax burden is now 16th in the nation, up from 47th! As a mother of three children, I share the concern of all who recognize the importance of a quality education.\101st DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\KATE HOLLINGSWORTH\AGE: 38\HOME: Imperial\OCCUPATION: Legislator, Missouri\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent, elected November 1996; Windsor Township Democratic committeewoman, elected 1994.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? My first priority will be passage of the Family Care Safety Act (HB1684), which would require background checks of child care and elder care workers and consolidate the information into a database. A toll-free telephone line will provide families and employers access to these public records so that they can make a more informed decision when choosing caregivers. Another of my priorities is a thorough review of the relationship between home buyers and developers to see if legislation could solve current problems.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My record of working for the families of Jefferson County clearly sets me apart from my opponents. In my first term as state representative, I filed 10 bills and passed six bills out of the House to become law. Three of the bills I sponsored were a result of issues brought to me by constituents. One must also be responsive to constituents in order to remain an involved legislator. I have developed effective communication methods informing constituents of new programs and funding opportunities which ultimately helps families, schools and businesses in the district. My effectiveness as a legislator is also evidenced by being named Legislative Hero for Kids by Citizens for Missouri's Children, obtaining over $3 million for Jefferson County projects, serving as chair of the subcommittee on welfare reform and as vice chair of the social services committee.\LIBERTARIAN\TERRY JOSEPH MEYER\AGE: 43\HOME: northern Jefferson County\OCCUPATION: Insurance claims supervisor\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? 1) Establish an ombudsman program in every state agency that would be able to provide meaningful assistance to individuals and businesses who encounter problems when dealing with state agencies. 2) Work for a constitutional amendment that would create a tribunal composed of representatives of the legislative, executive and judicial branches that would have the power to overturn any Missouri Supreme Court decision that rules as unconstitutional any legislation enacted by the legislature. 3) Develop alternatives to the current anti-drug strategy of incarceration and more tax spending for prisons which has perpetuated a permanent criminal underclass. 4) Work to reduce taxes, education spending waste and reduce overall revenue available to the state. 5) Oppose p ublic and private racial and gender preferences.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My opponents represent two sides of the same coin in terms of the Republican and Democratic candidates. Their party's philosophy is one of tax and spend with the only difference being that they each have different spending priorities. The Libertarian party stands for true fiscal conservatism and limited government in both the public and private sector, with an emphasis on personal privacy rights and personal property rights. We need a viable third party to break the stranglehold that the two major parties have on our political system, and the Libertarian party is the most broad-based and best choice for a third party.\U.S. TAXPAYERS\TIM PERRY\AGE: 35\HOME: northern Jefferson County\OCCUPATION: Delivery driver, Folsom Distributing\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I would work to eliminate income taxes, reform property taxes to protect the homes of our seniors, prevent the expansion of gambling into Kimmswick, end abortion, and reform crime laws to end probation/parole for violent offenders and require criminals to provide restitution to victims.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: Neither Kate Hollingsworth nor Paul Wieland have shown the leadership in the legislature that the people in this district deserve. I will provide a strong, active voice for the 101st District, instead of a passive style content to vote the party line. My background as a blue-collar worker also gives me insights into the needs of my constituents that my opponents lack.\102nd DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\RYAN GLENNON MCKENNA\No Response received.\REPUBLICAN\LEW HAYES\AGE: 57\HOME: northern Jefferson County\OCCUPATION: Senior financial accountant, Sunnen Products Co.\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Coming from an extensive accounting background, I feel we need legislation that provides for greater accountability, oversight and better management in state government. Specifically, I support building state reserves to protect programs from cuts if and when we have a weakened economy. I will work to pass legislation that addresses urban and rural spending inequities in education and transportation. My legislative focus will be to protect important existing programs and to provide more money to fund future needs that Missourians will need to meet the challenges in the next millennium.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: Experience is the key contrast between my opponent and myself. I am a certified management accountant with over 25 years experience. My extensive experience in accounting and management make me the right candidate in this race. Why? Because the best approach to protect funding for our schools, transportation, the elderly, and children who depend on government is to assure accountable and prudent use of our resources. We have many politicians in both parties that are talented dreamers who will offer new approaches to governing. To govern we need a balance of creativity and prudent management. While management issues are not glamorous, they will determine our ability to deliver new programs and protect existing programs. I am committed to serving as a catalyst for better management and greater accountability in state government.\103rd DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\MARK C. ABEL\AGE: 48\HOME: Festus\OCCUPATION: Insurance agent, Mark Abel Insurance\POLITICAL CAREER: Festus council member, 1979; state representative, elected 1984, re-elected, 1986 and 1988.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I'll work for educational improvements, work to improve equity in educational funding, access to health care, insurance reforms, elimination of state sales tax on motor vehicles, election reforms, greater aid for sewer and storm-water needs for growing counties, highway and transportation needs.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I am more in touch with the attitudes of the district, and closer to the views of the constituency. I have more of an opportunity to get things done for the district. Past experience and performance show I can get more things done, versus the previous performance of my opponent.\REPUBLICAN\GEORGE ""BOB"" ENGELBACH\AGE: 57\HOME: unincorporated Jefferson County near Hillsboro\OCCUPATION: Sheet Metal Worker, Local 36, Big Boy's Steel Erection Inc.; also own a beef operation west of Pevely\POLITICAL CAREER: Elected to Hillsboro School Board, 1997; elected to Joachim Plattin Ambulance District Board, 1994 and 1997; state representative, 1991-1993.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? Water in Jefferson County, drinking water, storm water control and sanitary sewers has been and will continue to be a priority. I will hold Missouri Department of Transportation accountable for the 15-year plan put forth to get the 6 cent gas tax passed in 1992. I will continue to fight for fair funding for education, to stop unnecessary red tape and regulation placed on the classroom teacher, to return power from huge, anonymous bureaucracies in Washington D.C., to our states, communities, local school boards and parents. Our state budget has nearly doubled in seven years! As a fiscal conservative, I will continue to work for smaller, more efficient government with lower taxes that will let citizens keep more of their money.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I have a proven record of community service to be proud of and over 25 years experience with the issues we face. As past chairman for the area and Jefferson County Clean Water Committees, currently serving on school, ambulance, soil and water conservation, Great Rivers Alliance Natural Resource boards, I continue to be an effective leader. My record while serving in the Missouri Legislature: The taxpayers Watch Dog Association, 100 percent rating; Missouri Family Network, 100 percent rating; Missouri Chamber of Commerce, 80 percent rating; Missouri Right to Life, endorsement and excellent rating; National Rifle Association, A+ rating; American Rifleman, A- rating; awarded ""Outstanding Freshman Legislator for Government Reform.""\104th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\WES WAGNER\No Response received.\104th DISTRICT\REPUBLICAN\LILA M. SPRADLING\AGE: 49\HOME: De Soto\OCCUPATION: Teacher, Dunklin R-5 School District\POLITICAL CAREER: Never held public office\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I want to see monies more equitably distributed among Missouri school districts (specifically the desegregation leftovers), health care for the elderly improved and expanded, tax burden on Missourians reduced, accountability returned to the family, zero-tolerance for drunk driving, drug use, and domestic violence.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I have a master's degree in education and have taught school for 27 years. I have 30 years of life/work experiences - dealing with and understanding people, obtaining work objectives, and I have extensive problem-solving skills after working for the Missouri educational system. I have raised three children and sent two through college. I believe these experiences give me better qualifications than my opponent.\105th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\HAROLD R. SELBY\AGE: 41\HOME: Cedar Hill\OCCUPATION: Computer technician, Owner of Seltronics\POLITICAL CAREER: Elected 1994 as director of the Jefferson County 911 board.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? 1) Freeze property tax assessments of property owned by persons over age 62. 2) Health care that cares: Stop hospitals from downsizing, de-skilling and understaffing. Make HMOs accountable. 3) Highways: We have never got our share of highway funds. I would pass a fairness doctrine so that counties that pay in the most get their fair share of highway funds. 4) Education: Our kids have to sell magazines and pizzas so that they can have computers in their classrooms. This has to stop. I would stop the state from playing shell games with money that was meant for education.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I have never taken any money from any person, political action committee (PAC), corporation or lobbyist. Money is buying influence in our state, and the only way to stop it is to elect people with the dignity to say no. I will represent all of the people in the 105th District. They are my only special interest group.\REPUBLICAN\CAROL STALLMAN\AGE: 52\HOME: unincorporated Eureka area of Jefferson County\OCCUPATION: Funeral director, Jay B. Smith Funeral Home\POLITICAL CAREER: Elected director on the Eureka Fire Protection District, 1993; elected Meramec Township Republican committeewoman, since 1986.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I would seek legislation that would substantially lower taxes. It is the best way to help our families. Higher taxes puts families in need of government services which weakens the family as a unit. If government feeds our children in schools, raises them in agnostic, amoral day- care schools, starting at the early age of three, then it has taken over the job of the family. If the government is taking care of our parents when they get older, or helping out a relative when they are in poor finances, then it has taken over the job of the family. Strong families are the best solution to many of the problems we face today: crime, drugs, education, etc. Families will strengthen only if they are able to keep more of their own resources and therefore be allowed to be responsible for what they do best - taking care of each other.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I believe I have the best qualifications with various positions I have been honored to serve. From serving as First District Commissioner to being elected to the Board of the Eureka Fire Protection District, each has been a learning experience which I believe can only enhance my ability to represent the people of the 105th District.\LIBERTARIAN\RICHARD E. FORD\No Response received.\108th DISTRICT\Democrat incumbent Brian May is unopposed.\109th DISTRICT\Republican incumbent John E. Griesheimer is unopposed.\110th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\FRANCIS OVERSCHMIDT\AGE: 55\HOME: Union\OCCUPATION: Farmer and businessman, self-employed\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent, first elected November 1990; re- elected 1992, 1994 and 1996; elected to unexpired term as associate Franklin County Commissioner, 1988 and re-elected, 1988.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? I will continue to improve Missouri's tourism industry. The amount of good jobs as well as the added tax dollars have greatly enhanced this region's tourism market. Education is very important as well. I will continue to support legislation that will make our classrooms smaller. Drugs and the crime associated with the production and use of drugs are having a devastating effect on our communities. I will continue to support increased funding for law enforcement and public safety. Specifically, the threat that methamphetamine labs pose to Missouri's urban and rural areas demands immediate attention. Strengthening laws aimed at these offenders must be a priority. Legislation pertaining to the elderly and disabled and the care that they receive has always been important to me. We must not cut funding for the vital programs and services.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: My experience as county commissioner for two terms, in addition to having been state representative for the past four terms, has given me valuable insight into providing the best service to the constituents of this district. My voting record reflects the concerns of the people that I represent. These qualifications are essential when it comes to truly representing the constituents of a district. If re-elected, I will continue to do so to the best of my ability.\REPUBLICAN\JOHN BART LIPPERT\AGE: 33\HOME: Union\OCCUPATION: Self-employed\POLITICAL CAREER: Elected to Union Board of Aldermen, April 1997.\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? We must shrink the size and scope of government, reduce the state budget and cut taxes so people can keep more and do more with their money. We will work to protect property owners' rights. Pass tough laws that put repeat criminals and drug dealers behind bars, not back on the street. Education is a top priority of mine. I believe children need to learn the basics like reading, writing, phonics and mathematics. I will fight to ensure the rights of all our citizens are protected including unborn children. I support our right to keep and bear arms. The dependent deduction should be increased. All women work, whether in or out of the home. That is why I would like to see expanding the ""Day Care"" deduction for parents who stay home with their children or send their children to private schools.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: Our state budget has nearly doubled since my opponent was first elected in 1991 largely due to his voting. He cast the deciding votes on the largest tax increase in Missouri history in 1993, and the smelly pension increase for himself just this past year. The self-serving days of the Missouri Legislature must come to an end before they tax us all into poverty. I will push to cut taxes and require a popular vote of the people or a two-thirds vote of the legislature in order to pass any new tax increases. I have the education, the experience, and the leadership abilities to help lead Missouri into the 21st century.\111th DISTRICT\DEMOCRAT\ELIZABETH ""LIZ"" CALVIN\No Response received.\REPUBLICAN\JIM FROELKER\AGE: 49\HOME: Gerald\OCCUPATION: Quality control inspector, Boeing Inc.\POLITICAL CAREER: Incumbent; first elected, 1988; re-elected 1990, 1992, 1994 and 1996; Owensville School Board, 1986\IF ELECTED, WHAT LEGISLATION WOULD YOU SEEK? If elected, I would make state government more efficient by eliminating waste and abuse. Increase educational opportunities beyond high school. Health care reform that increases access in rural areas and allows choice of doctors; tax breaks for senior citizens; increase penalties for driving while intoxicated and road rage.\WHY SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED: I take a common-sense, conservative approach to state government. My experience as a school board member and as a state legislator has given me both experience and knowledge to serve the 111th District."
226,"SPECIAL SECTION VOTERS' GUIDE MISSOURI GENERAL ELECTION STATE HOUSE / STATE SENATE\Correction published November 7, 2000 - The candidate response form and photo of District 108 Republican state representative candidate Ray Stephens were omitted from the Voters' Guide published Friday. Here is the response of Ray Stephens, a Republican, and his opponent, Thomas Albert Villa, a Democrat. District 108 Republican RAY STEPHENS Age: 63 Home: St. Louis Occupation: Engineer, Burns and McDonnell Political career: Committeeman, 12th Ward, 1998 to present. If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would b ring the most benefit to the residents of your district? 1. Elimination of any and all public financing of Planned Parenthood or any other such organization in this state. 2. Prohibiting the marketing, sale or use of body parts from any of these type facilities in this state. 3. Permit parents to have school choice for their children's education, such as vouchers or tax credits. However, safeguards would have to be in place to ensure that the money will go directly to the chosen school. 4. Protection of law-abiding citizens to have the right to carry arms as defined in the second amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 5. Require the state to cut taxes. Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No. The taxpayers in this state are already overburdened with taxes. Let's get the government involvement out of business as much as possible. Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I am 63 and married to my wife, Barbara, for 37 years. We have lived at this same address since 1963. I have four children and four grandchildren. I plan to retire from engineering at the end of next year to dedicate a full-time effort to public service. I believe the aforementioned views are shared with most of my constituents. I have received endorsements from the Missouri Right to Life and the National Rifle Association. Democrat THOMAS ALBERT VILLA Age: 55 Home: St. Louis Occupation: Full-time campaigner Political Career: Missouri House of Representatives, 1974-1984; President, St. Louis Board of Aldermen, 1987-1995 If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Education: Assure funding of oversight committee in SB 781; Transportation: Renew effort to prioritize needs and identify funding sources. Transfer over 70 miles of St. Louis arterial roads to the state. Convince the Legislature to make mass transit part of the total plan. Bi-State Development Agency needs more state money. Fine-tune existing auto emission requirements. Tax Increment Financing: Limit to truly blighted areas. Redirect investments to the city and areas in need of development. Tobacco Settlement Money: The state will receive $6.5 billion. Appropriate to city health care. Do you support public funding of a new stadium for the Cardinals? The city clearly has a financial interest in keeping the taxes generated by 3 million people watching the Cardinals at 81 games per season. Diverting part of the state sales tax that the stadium generates toward partial payment for a new stadium makes economic sense. Tax increment financing could supplement the public contribution. A public-private partnership provides jobs, civic growth, family entertainment and revenue that vibrant cities require. Rather than a short-sighted attempt to punish success, I want to participate in it. Yes. Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? The population loss in the city of St. Louis will result in the loss of a number of Missouri House seats. My experience in the legislative process and my proven track record in government service make me the superior candidate. The city of St. Louis has to have strong representation in Jefferson City. {TYPE} ELECTION 2000 / CAMPAIGN 2000 MISSOURI GENERAL ELECTION CANDIDATES FOR MISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\ STATE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\ Voters in the St. Louis area will elect more than 60 state representatives Tuesday in the state House of Representatives.\ Representatives serve two-year terms, at a yearly salary of $30,536.\ Here are responses from candidates in contested races. In several races, candidates from as many as four parties are seeking the same seat.\ Candidates are listed in ballot order.\ District 9\ Democrat\ Wes Shoemyer\ No response received\ Republican\ James ""Jamie"" Ebbesmeyer\ Age: 32\ Home: Paris\ Occupation: Farmer, self-employed, Ebbesmeyer Hog Farm\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Having listened to the voters of this district, I would seek legislation which addresses the concerns of our rural district in the following areas: 1. Education; expanding resources to rural schools. 2. Roads and bridges; completing the projects promised and needed in this area. 3. Crime; enforcement and funding of drug laws. 4. Protection of rights; gun owners and landowners, the unborn and the elderly.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? While realizing that the Cardinals are an asset to Missouri's economy, I believe that any money that would be put towards a new stadium could be used more effectively to benefit Missouri's citizens. For example, that money could go towards the improvement and development of Missouri's roads and towards the improvement and financing of Missouri's school system.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I should be elected because I have the experience of working for and with the people of this district on a day-to-day basis through business transactions and professional organizations such as Missouri Farm Bureau. I would be a representative of this district's voters, bringing the common-sense approach and rural hometown values of respect and responsibility to the state government. These are things we expect from our families and neighbors in this area and I believe they need to be exemplified in our state government.\ District 11\ Democrat\ Phil Smith\ Incumbent\ Age: 54\ Home: Louisiana\ Occupation: Lawyer, self-employed\ Political career: State representative, 1990 to present\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Better roads and bridges; smaller class sizes and better-trained teachers and prescription drug relief for seniors.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Not unless my constituents change their minds.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? My experience; the results I have produced for my district; my responsiveness to my constituents and because of the legislation I have passed in regard to our children and school safety, juvenile law reforms and tougher sentences for criminals.\ Republican\ Carol J. Wessel\ Home: Troy\ Occupation: Real estate agent, Briggs Realty\ Political career: Never held public office\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I will support legislation that reforms government, which will result in less taxes, fees and regulations and will help return freedom to our parents, schools and churches.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No, not without more information.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I believe directly opposite of our current state representative. I believe in pro-life, less taxes and less government. I believe in representing the voters of our area.\ District 12\ Democrat: Incumbent Bill Luetkenhaus, Josephville, is unopposed.\ District 13\ Republican: Incumbent Jon Dolan, Lake Saint Louis, is unopposed.\ District 14\ Democrat\ Greg Faupel\ Age: 43\ Home: St. Charles\ Occupation: Operating engineer, Local 513, McCarthy Construction\ Political career: Ferguson city councilman/mayor pro tem, 1988 to 1997 (represented Ward 3)\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Work with local school districts and teachers to better our schools; sponsor legislation to lower or fix cost on senior citizens' medical and prescription cost; find funding that can be moved to update roads and sewer systems to one of the fastest growing areas in this state and regulate and lower insurance policies and cost.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Pub lic financing is OK to a certain point. But before a new stadium is built, location should be the first thing that should be considered. Also, no type of TIF deals should be made (tax increment financing or tax relief for large companies).\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? My opponent is a closet state representative. You never see or hear from her until election time. When elected, I will hold public forums on a regular basis and report via mail or newspaper. I will not be a politician, but rather represent District 14 as a public servant.\ Republican\ Cindy Ostmann\ Incumbent\ Age: 61\ Home: St. Peters\ Occupation: Owner-manager rental property\ Political career: Four terms on the Fort Zumwalt School District School Board; State representative, District 14, 1992 to present.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? My service on the Transportation Committee as well as my position on the Transportation Oversight Committee makes it possible for me to address the transportation needs of St. Charles County residents. At the same time, my position on the Missouri Women's Council and the Women's Health Council keeps me involved in issues that impact women and their families.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I am open-minded on the Cardinal stadium issue. I have not seen a presentation of the proposal, but understand the new stadium is just one part of a comprehensive St. Louis revitalization plan. It would, in that case, be worthy of very serious consideration. I have co-signed and co-sponsored several bills aimed at the rebirth of St. Louis city and tend to look favorably on those issues.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I have no idea wher e my opponent stands on any of the issues. Therefore, I will run on my past record and the value of my experience. I work well with both Republicans and Democrats and for that reason have been successful in passing my legislation. My ability to work across party lines has also led to my appointment to several important special committees. I intend to continue to work for consensus on issues important to St. Charles and to the metro area.\ District 15\ Democrat\ Thomas S. Green\ Age: 34\ Home: St. Charles\ Occupation: Accountant, D and S Electrical Contracting Consultants Inc.\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Our community is changing. Currently, the school districts in our community, Francis Howell and St. Charles, are both financially stressed and have a public perception that the education being provided is not as good as it should be. Families do not want to move into our community because of our educational problems. Our community needs a legislator who can vote for laws that will help our educational system get out of its downward spiral and move forward. As an accountant, I will bring fiscal responsibility to our school districts. I will vote to fund more early childhood programs and work to make sure that my family and the families of the 15th District have the opportunity to save for higher education, tax free.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I have lived in this metropolitan area my whole life. I have worked in this community. I have volunteered with the Communication Committee of Francis Howell, which is working with parents, teachers and administrators to help our school district deal correctly with financial problems. I have been helping our community deal with its problems by working with Sen. Ted House and other legislators from St. Charles to make sure our needs are addressed.\ Republican\ Jon L. Bennett\ Incumbent\ Age: 33\ Home: St. Charles\ Occupation: Financial Planner, self employed\ Political career: State representative 1994, 1996, 1998\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would b ring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I seek appropriate spending of the state budget. More money to education does not necessarily mean better quality education. I will be filing legislation on the first day of session that will change the way we inspect automobile emissions in the St. Louis area. We should move to the BAR-97 static test, an updated version of the old program (BAR-90), and utilize the rapid-screen technology to catch polluters. This way, all cars are tested and we have a more solid program in place to enhance air quality. I will continue to try to make higher education more accessible and affordable.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No -- I am not convinced that Busch Stadium is in bad enough shape to be replaced, and I certainly don't think that, when it comes time for replacement, that the costs should be covered by taxpayers across the state.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I represent the core values of my district. I was born and raised in the district and am now raising my family here. We passed legislation this year to assist the Francis Howell district in the repayment of the money due Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The St. Charles School District needs additional support from the state as a Hold Harmless district. We need to pass, at the very least, a provision allowing our Hold Harmless schools a cost-of-living increase annually to assist them in meeting their growing budgetary guidelines.\ District 16\ Democrat\ Jim Oberts\ Age: 67\ Home: St. Charles\ Occupation: Part-time blackjack dealer, Station Casino St. Charles\ Political career: Never held public office\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Working to get highway funds sent to the district to complete current projects and make much needed repairs.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Not under the present plan. I believe that the ownership should at least double their proposed investment.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I am not a politician. Thirty years in the banking industry gives me the tools and the know-how to keep an eye on income and expenses. Balancing budgets and financial forecast experience are more than talk, they are needed.\ Republican\ Carl L. Bearden\ Age: 44\ Home: St. Charles\ Occupation: Consultant, self-employed\ Political career: St. Charles County Council, elected Nov. 1992 - present.\ Campaign Web site: www.carlbearden.com\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Property tax relief for senior citizens. A homestead exemption for senior citizens 65 and older will result in putting a halt to rising property tax bills, e specially for those on fixed incomes. Transportation. Funds must be made available to ensure the timely completion of Page Avenue. Enhance Local Control for Education. Local districts should be allowed to designate themselves as ""charter schools,"" relieving them of unneeded and costly state bureaucracy.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I have not seen the proposal for public financing and do not have all the details necessary to say yes or no at this time. I would not support any public financing that would require more money be paid by the state than is directly generated in sales taxes by the stadium. In other words, if the sales taxes collected at the stadium did not cover the costs, then private money should make up the shortfall.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? My ability to successfully serve the people of the 16th district has been demonstrated through my service on the County Council. I have been part of a County Council that has eliminated debt, lowered property taxes by over $11 million and established a savings account for county government to draw on in rough times. I have demonstrated the ability to work with people from differing points of view and political parties.\ District 17\ Democrat\ Bruce W. Holt\ Age: 48\ Home: St. Peters\ Occupation: Member, Painters District Council 2\ Political career: Alderman, City of St. Peters, serving second term.\ Campaign Web site: www.votebruceholt.com\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I support a freeze on property assessments for those over age 65. I would also like to see the state help reduce the cost of prescription medicines through sponsoring a nonprofit statewide co-op for buying power. I will also support a Patients' Bill of Rights to protect consumers from HMOs denying treatments recommended by doctors. I will also introduce legislation to ban companies from selling private information about your buying habits, medical or financial information to other companies or telemarketers.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? While I have serious reservations concerning the scope of public tax support being sought for a new stadium, the Cardinals are an outstanding franchise which has brought a number of benefits to our region. I have no problem considering reinvesting some portion of the state sales taxes generated by the stadium in a public-private partnership. Such an arrangement would have to be carefully researched to make sure the public benefit was shared by fans in the form of continued access to lower cost tickets and a solid plan for economic development of the surrounding area to a new stadium.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I believe my service in local government has prepared me to be a better state representative. We need the perspective of a local government decision maker in Jefferson City, someone who has had to answer to the taxpayers, balance a budget and deliver cost-effective services to the people. My opponent has never held elective public office. As an alderman, I have a 100 percent attendance record and have participated in over 500 hours of public meetings.\ Republican\ Joe Smith\ Age: 28\ Home: St. Peters\ Occupation: Tram driver, United Parcel Service\ Political career: Never held public office.\ Campaign Web site: joesmith4rep.com\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? My legislative goals of health care reform and campaign finance reform coupled with my sincere interest in constituent services on issues like better highways and access to government services are how I will bring the most benefit to my constituents in the 17th District.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? The only stadium project that I would support would be one that financially favors the fans and taxpayers. Public money for a private developer is not good public policy. Any plan must benefit the people first if government dollars are involved.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I am an involved and interested member of my community who will vote in line with the common sense and values of my constituents.\ District 18\ Democrat\ Richard Lewis Rolf Sr.\ Age: 45\ Home: St. Charles\ Occupation: Electrician\ Political career: Current school board member of the Orchard Farm R-5 District.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? 1. Improving education. I have been a part of implementing the High Risk At-Risk Student Improvement Plan. 2. End senior abuse and neglect. We must also freeze property tax assessments for senior citizens, lower prescription costs and help people get the help they need to stay in their homes longer. 3. Ensure that 100 percent of gasoline taxes fund highways and interchanges. 4. Stop companies from selling private information on your buying habits, finances or health to other firms and telemarketers.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I would be willing to consider, under certain conditions, using a portion of the state sales tax generated at the new baseball stadium to assist the franchise. I would also want to see them privately finance the lion's share of the project.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponents? I have the life experience it takes to be an effective voice for the needs of working families, senior citizens and our children. We also need a state representative who will put the public interest ahead of special interest. With my wife, Glenda, we have seven adult children and eight grandchildren. We also share our home with Glenda's mother. I served five years in the United States Marine Corps. I am pro- life.\ Republican\ Tom Dempsey\ Age: 33\ Home: St. Charles\ Occupation: Executive general manager, The Columns Banquet and Conference Center\ Political career: St. Charles City Council, 1998 to present\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? We need to lower the tax burden for the people of St. Charles as well as the rest of Missouri. Money is best spent by those who earn it.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? The scale and scope of the project is much more than a stadium. I would consider it, but would have to learn a great deal more. For a stadium alone, the answer is unlikely.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponents? I have a great desire to serve St. Charles. I am proud of our city and aware of our needs as a community. As a lifelong resident, I have watched St. Charles grow and thrive. The relationships that I have made and my experience as a father, businessman and council person have given me the knowledge and understanding necessary to represent the people who live and work in District 18.\ Libertarian\ Kurt C. Trachte\ Age: 43\ Home: St. Charles\ Occupation: Operating engineer International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 513\ Political career: Councilman, City of Berkeley, 1981-1991\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Use privileges to tell the inside story, e.g. what lobbyists offer, what social functions are like, etc. It would be different.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Did not respond to question.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponents? I don't know anything about them.\ District 19\ Republican\ Charles F. Nordwald\ Incumbent; no response received.\ Libertarian\ Lisa D. Hoffman\ Age: 45\ Home: Bellflower\ Occupation: Cashier/data processing, Crossroads Regional Hospital\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would brin g the most benefit to the residents of your district? I would seek more educational funding for our schools and make sure that gambling revenue was earmarked only for education as promised.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No. I do not believe in subsidies for private industry. I am a free market Libertarian.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I hope to bring a fresh outlook to state government by reviewing and reforming the already overwhelming amount of laws currently on the books. My goal is to put the people first in terms of personal choice and civil liberties. I intend to be a voice of conscience through true nonpartisan leadership.\ District 57\ Democrat: Incumbent O. L. Shelton, St. Louis, is unopposed.\ District 58\ Democrat: Incumbent Louis H. Ford, St. Louis, is unopposed.\ District 59\ Democrat\ Russ Carnahan\ Age: 42\ Home: St. Louis\ Occupation: Attorney, BJC Health System\ Political career: Never held public office.\ Campaign Web site: www.russcarnahan.org\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I would fight for continued funding for urban development/anti-sprawl incentives that have been highly successful in renewing our neighborhoods, business districts and downtown; seek better educational options, performance and funding for our schools and teachers; urge continued progress increasing the number of children and families with health insurance, including use of a substantial portion of the tobacco settlement proceeds for health care.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Only within limits. Our professional sports teams are a huge cultural, recreational and financial asset for our region and especially downtown. I am willing to consider public money to support them but only on three conditions: 1. The state has available revenue. 2. The state share of participation is reasonable and not excessive. 3. The state will receive a fair return on its investment.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I have over 20 years experience in government and law, including almost five years working directly on the staff in the Missouri House of Representatives. This is especially important as our district loses its experienced representative of 23 years and term limits bring in a large new class of House members. I will also be better situated to coordinate with our city and regional delegation and local officials because of my experience and relationships from working with our area governmental leaders.\ Republican\ J.R. McDaniel\ Age: 40\ Home: St. Louis\ Occupation: Packer/shipper, The Book Source\ Political career: St. Louis committeeman, 1996 and 2000\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Elimination of sales tax on food; education and crime initiatives such as boot camp and community service for vandals to repair properties.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Not a complete financing. Maybe a percentage.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? Because I know the needs of the people in my district and I bring ideas that are good for the whole district.\ District 60\ Democrat: Incumbent Amber Holly Boykins, St. Louis, is unopposed.\ District 61\ Democrat: Connie ""LaJoyce"" Johnson, St. Louis, is unopposed.\ District 62\ Democrat: Incumbent Charles Quincy Troupe, St. Louis, is unopposed.\ District 63\ Democrat: Maida Coleman, St. Louis, is unopposed.\ District 64\ Democrat: Incumbent Bob Hilgemann, St. Louis, is unopposed.\ District 65\ Democrat\ Derio Gambaro\ Incumbent\ Age: 44\ Home: St. Louis\ Occupation: Engineer, BRI, Inc.\ Political career: State representative, 1998-present\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? The primary concerns facing the district are: 1. Improved educational opportunities for students and parents. 2. Adequate housing for all income levels. 3. Safe, crime-free neighborhoods. 4. Sustaining economic growth primarily by support of our small businesses.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Until I am shown credible evidence that the taxpayers' investment will yield appropriate returns, I cannot support the new stadium.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? The two years I have served in Jefferson City have given me valuable experience. In that time I have also gained considerable respect among my contemporaries. This experience and respect will help me promote positive change for the constituents of the 65th district.\ Republican\ Kevin Weaks\ Age: 23\ Home: St. Louis\ Occupation: Advertising account representative, St. Louis Post- Dispatch\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would brin g the most benefit to the residents of your district? I would seek to improve our public and private education systems. To do this, parents must be given maximum school choice with an emphasis on a state-run voucher system. I would work to limit the reach of Washington into our classrooms and shift the balance of power over our schools toward Missouri and away from Washington money.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I support the idea of using a portion of the taxes generated through ticket sales, merchandise, etc., to help finance a new stadium for the Cardinals that will benefit the city for years to come.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I should be elected on my education plan and my ideas to make Missouri, particularly the city of St. Louis, a better place to live. My election to the Missouri House would end the generations of uninterrupted one-party rule in the district and provide the citizens of the 65th an accountable representative in Jefferson City.\ District 66\ Democrat\ Harry Kennedy\ Incumbent\ Age: 48\ Home: St. Louis\ Occupation: State representative and real estate agent, Gundaker Realtors\ Political career: Democratic committeeman, appointed 1991, elected 1992, 1996, 2000. State representative 66th District, 1996, 1998\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? 1. Health care benefits legislation. 2. Prescription drug relief for seniors. 3. Tax relief (i.e. tax reduction) and/or reducing the size of government. 4. Legislation that transfers from the city to the state the cost of maintaining major roads. 5. Continued funding for the home remodeling tax credit program. 6. Tax Increment Financing (TIF) reform so only communities that need this incentive receive it. 7. Funding programs/ research to help prevent vision loss. 8. Assistance for small businesses.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I do not support a taxpayer subsidy of $250-plus million. We have other priorities -- schools, transportation, infrastructure, small business needs, etc. I would consider some limited public funding for specific needs but only if the Cardinal organization pay or raise from private sources (private investment) the majority of the money.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? 1. Experience. I have sponsored or co-sponsored several pieces of legislation that have been signed by the governor (i.e. 3 percent reduction on food, Home Remodeling Tax Credit, Quality of Patient Care legislation). 2. Accountability. I attend various neighborhood and business meetings each month. I respond quickly to citizens' questions and requests. 3. Agenda. My goals are to help the city prosper economically, culturally, educationally.\ Green\ Patricia A.

State- sponsored universal health care, such as the bill that died in committee last session.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? 1. My support for progressive views are more representative of the district. 2. My non-reliance on big business campaign contributions frees me to represent people instead of special interests.\ District 67\ Democrat\ Pat Dougherty\ Incumbent\ Age: 52\ Home: St. Louis\ Occupation: Legislator\ Political career: State representative, first elected 1978.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I would seek greater economic development dollars for increased jobs and small business for the whole city, so we'll all grow and prosper; greater accountability by public school system; increase in senior circuit breaker; prescription drug benefit, especially for seniors and disabled; housing and economic development tax credits; increase in youth opportunities and violence prevention programs.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I would consider supporting it if: 1. Our schools did not lose any funding. 2. Public tax money would be small. 3. The owner would invest in making new housing and retail a reality around the stadium. 4. Naming rights be assigned to the state or city.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I will continue my record of strong constituent service and being active and accessible. I will continue to fight for laws that improve our lives. I have written or helped pass new laws on child protection, protecting seniors from abuse, hate crimes, breast cancer, anti- stalking, domestic violence, city nuisance laws and animal care. As chair of the Children, Youth and Families Committee, I will continue my strong record of advocacy for my city and district.\ Green\ Jason R. Toon\ Age: 26\ Home: St. Louis\ Occupation: Free-lance web designer\ Political career: Never held public office.\ Campaign Web site: www.mogreens. homestead.com/toon.html\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I would immediately seek to raise the minimum wage in Missouri or, barring that, give cities the right to set their own minimum wage. I would try to create a single, statewide school district, ending forever the inequities in education that Missouri's children face. I would also advocate a ban on all logging on public lands. Our state forests belong to us, and should not be used as a source for corporate profits. Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No. We have too many pressing needs to give away tax money to a hugely successful business like the Cardinals. A new stadium would be a financial bonanza for the Cardinals owners, and there's no reason why public money should be part of that. If the owners claim they can't make a profit, I say sell the team to a group of fans, as in Green Bay. At least then we'd be sure that the Cardinals could never threaten to move. Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? Like most people in my district, I am firmly pro-choice. My opponent is not. His views are simply not in line with the majority of his constituents. Unlike him, I would make an effort to end, once and for all, the constant attempts by our Legislature to restrict reproductive freedom. District 77\ Democrat\ David L. Reynolds\ Incumbent\ Age: 63\ Home: Florissant\ Occupation: Writer/editor, Reynolds Publishing\ Political career: Florissant City Council, 1976-1995; State representative, 1995 to present.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Health insurance to all. Right to collective bargaining for all.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No opinion -- have not received adequate information on the need for a new public-financed stadium.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? Experienced and demonstrated leadership in labor-related issues, health issues and protection of the unborn.\ Republican\ Forester Jenkins\ Age: 50\ Home: Florissant\ Occupation: Construction, Fru-Con Construction\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I would get the Missouri Department of Transportation to keep Interstate 270 cleaned and the grass cut like they are supposed to do. Find money for improving Shackelford from a two-lane road to a four- or five-lane road. We have had an increase in residents to this area but no road improvements. I would not be absent when the time comes to vote on important bills. I will not seek another office when I am elected to serve the people.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Yes, I do, because I feel that it would generate more jobs and more revenue for the city.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? Because I will not seek another office after I am elected. I will perform the duties that the people have sent me there for. I care about the people in my district, and I will let them know of the bills that would affect them. I will not be absent when the roll is called to vote on bills.\ District 78\ Democrat\ Damon Shelby Porter\ Age: 28\ Home: Florissant\ Occupation: Attorney and legislative director, Missouri House of Representatives\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? My top priority will be fighting to make sure the Ferguson-Florissant and Hazelwood school districts get their fair share of state school funds. I want to get back to the basics, but also prepare our children for the new Internet economy. I want to expand our prescription tax credit to all Missourians, young and old. I want to strengthen our privacy laws and keep personal, medical, and financial information safe and private.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Not one dime. Too many people in my district are struggling to make ends meet and are burdened with too many taxes. We should use the taxpayer's money wisely on issues that will benefit the entire community. Three hundred million dollars would be a major down payment on building new schools, providing day care for children and expanding health care to all. A stadium will last 25 years, but a quality education will last a lifetime.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? As a lifelong resident of North County and a graduate of the Hazelwood schools, I have a real understanding of this district's needs. Along with knowing the people, I know the legislative process serving as Legislative Director to the Missouri House Speaker. Mike Reid has not supported issues that are important to our community.\ Republican\ Michael J. Reid\ Incumbent\ Age: 45\ Home: Hazelwood\ Occupation: State representative\ Political career: State Representative 1991-1992 and 1999-2000. State Senator 1992-1994\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Creating jobs and economic growth should be our highest priority. I believe that lower taxes (and interest rates) will stimulate the economy and create more jobs. Targeting educational resources so that all children learn to read in kindergarten and first grade will also be a high priority. I will sponsor legislation to make health care more affordable by providing tax deductions for people who need health insurance. I will co-sponsor legislation to use the money from the tobacco settlement for health care and to help senior citizens with the high cost of prescription drugs.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? Leadership includes being proactive, looking to the future and solving problems before they get bigger. In 1993 I sponsored and passed legislation to create scholarship and fellowship programs for young women and men pursuing education in math, science and foreign languages -- areas vital to our economic future. In 1994 I sponsored and passed legislation that made people with severe disabilities eligible for the circuit breaker property tax credit. This year I sponsored legislation to increase funding for public schools by $35 million per year. If I am elected again I will continue to support our public schools and I will sponsor legislation to help senior citizens with the cost of their prescription drugs.\ District 79\ Democrat: Incumbent Patrick J. O'Connor, Bridgeton, is unopposed.\ District 80\ Democrat\ John J. Hickey\ Incumbent\ Age: 35\ Home: Bridgeton\ Occupation: Pipefitter, Pipefitters Local 562\ Political career: State representative, 80th District, 1992 to present\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I would promote safer schools and better resources for students and teachers to take advantage of all that the new century has to offer. The constituents of this district deserve a responsive and responsible government that addresses their needs. I have sponsored legislation that would give our community more control over the expansion of Lambert Airport. When the airport expands into our community, our leaders should be able to make decisions that best represent the interests of those affected.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I do not believe I have received sufficient information to form an educated opinion. However, a strong commitment on the part of the private sector should be a prerequisite to any consideration of public financing.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? Over the past eight years, I think I've demonstrated my belief that every dime of taxpayers' money should be accounted for and spent in the most productive manner. I also believe that government should be less, not more, intrusive in people's lives. The role of government is to protect the people of the state from the actions of others, not from themselves. Additionally, I have sponsored legislation to reduce taxes and give the working people of the district the respect and dignity they deserve.\ Republican\ Fred L. Moore\ Age: 68\ Home: Edmundson\ Occupation: Avionics engineer/author\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? 1. Justice in the criminal justice system. 2. A decided improvement in literacy in our public school system. 3. Reduce airport noise and air pollution at Lambert. 4. Missouri needs a better strategy in dealing with the drug problem.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I'm not sure this is a county issue. I support the Cardinals franchise and would need to look at the details of that project before making any premature decision. If in the long term it would reduce taxes for my constituents, I would favor a referendum.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I am an author heavily involved in the subjects of literacy and recovery in drug addiction. I can present a comprehensive strategy to the legislature to improve Missouri's rating in education (it is dismally low). John Hickey has had no opposition his last two terms. My opponent's performance (or lack of it) speaks for itself. I know I could do much better.\ District 81\ Democrat: Incumbent James Michael Foley, St. Ann, is unopposed.\ District 82\ Republican: Incumbent David L.

A quality education for every child from pre-school to graduate school. I am committed to expanded educational opportunities in our public schools. 2. Affordable health care, including health insurance that covers vital prescription medicines and such life-saving procedures as mammograms. 3. I will continue to sponsor stronger measures against domestic violence and increased support for its victims.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? The responsibility for financing a new stadium must rest with private ownership and thus avoid reducing the tax base needed to support initiatives for education, health care and community development.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? As a teacher, mother, former school board member and current state representative, I bring valuable experience and special commitment to the educational issues and to the principles of good government. My constituents also benefit by my having learned, during an initial term, how to be effective within the legislature which was recognized when I received the year's (90th Assembly) outstanding Freshman Legislator award for achievement in education.\ Republican\ John Holmes\ Age: 59\ Home: Ladue\ Occupation: Retired\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Restore the public education budget to 51 percent of state revenues, merit pay for teachers, prescription drug assistance for the less fortunate elderly, support a 15-year road and bridge program, reform or end tax increment financing (TIF).\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Although I am generally opposed to corporate welfare, the Cardinals are such a treasure for St. Louis and Missouri that I would support a ballot referendum to put before the voters.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? As a four- year Air Force veteran and a fourth generation native Missourian who has followed state issues since entering high school, I feel more sensitive to issues concerning the people in the 83rd district as well as the state. I would make an effective, fiscally sound, concerned legislator.\ District 84\ Democrat\ Joan Bray\ Incumbent\ Age: 55\ Home: University City\ Occupation: Legislator, 84th District.\ Political career: 84th House District, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I represent some of the oldest inner ring suburbs of St. Louis County. I will continue to work for resources for reinvestment and redevelopment in these areas and for a balanced, funded, total transportation plan.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Not in the form of taxes. I would encourage the Cardinals to open up the organization to investment from the public.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I've done a good job for the past eight years. I have been active on behalf of my constituents and accessible to work with them on their needs.\ Republican\ Andy Buhr\ Age: 28\ Home: Richmond Heights\ Occupation: Project accountant-finance, Maritz, Inc.\ Political career: Committeeman, 17th Ward, St. Louis City Republican Central Committee (1996 - 1998); Committeeman, Haley Township, St. Louis County Republican Central Committee (2000).\ Campaign Web site: www.andybuhr.com\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I will support and work to bring progressive and sound reforms that keep government out of their lives, gives them more control with their children's education, builds a responsible MetroLink system and helps those who can't help themselves. I will help bring fair, balanced and pragmatic solutions to the issues that affect all the people in this unique district.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I believe that the region wants a new stadium. I support some public funding of the costs that are proportional to the amount that would be used by the public. Local corporations and organizations should pay for the majority of the expenses to build and operate the new facility.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I am a fresh voice and a real change who will bring a well-rounded, young and energetic perspective to our state government. I was born in Vietnam, adopted and raised in Missouri and I am a graduate of both CBC High School and St. Louis University. I will accurately represent the economic, social and cultural diversity of this district and will not adhere to a left- or right-wing agenda.\ District 85\ Democrat\ Christopher A. ""Chris"" Liese\ Incumbent\ Age: 37\ Home: Maryland Heights\ Occupation: Small-business owner, Liese & Associates (benefit and financial consulting firm)\ Political career: I was elected to the Missouri House in 1992, and re-elected in 1994, 1996, and 1998.\ Campaign Web site: www.ChrisLiese.com\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? My legislative priorities include: Protect public schools from proposals that would reduce funding. Continue to hold the Missouri Department of Transportation accountable every step of the way regarding the Page Avenue extension and 141 expansion. Protecting remaining community and property values against air/noise pollution and water runoff (erosion problems) is a top priority. Improve access and affordability to health care programs through market driven reforms, state mandates when necessary, and making managed care entities more accountable and continue to improve Missouri's business climate to encourage creation of more jobs.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I do not support the current proposal as publicly announced by Cardinal management. However, I am cautiously optimistic that an agreement may be reached that will be much better for taxpayers. We need to drive a hard but fair bargain with Cardinal management to get the best deal for our hard-earned tax dollars.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I am an effective legislator with a proven record. As state representative, I have fought and passed tough anti-crime legislation, welfare reform, improved access to health care and protected funding for our public schools. As a lifelong resident of this district, I will continue to represent the voters of this community through hard work, common sense and personal communication. I have promoted practical solutions over political partisanship in the Legislature. I will continue to support legislation that improves the quality of life for all Missourians.\ Republican\ Don Dosser\ Age: 54\ Home: West St. Louis County\ Occupation: Retired\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Lower state taxes are an attainable goal, and I will work to reduce the size of government by eliminating wasteful legislative spending from the last eight years. I will fight to return control of education to the local districts. Consistent state leadership for road relief and in our districts is needed.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I feel the funding for a new stadium is an issue that should be in the hands of the voters, who are very well-equipped to make that decision. We all know the revenue that the sports teams bring into the area.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? My opponent cannot run again (after this election) because of term limits and may be even less responsive than before to citizens' concerns. The majority of people I have talked to as I go door to door indicate they are looking for a change in representation.\ District 86\ Republican: Jane Cunningham, Chesterfield, is unopposed.\ District 87\ Republican\ Catherine L. Hanaway\ Incumbent; no response received.\ Libertarian\ John A. Wolf\ Age: 48\ Home: Rock Hill\ Occupation: Musician/ record producer/ arranger, self-employed\ Political career: Never held public office.\ Campaign Web site: johnwolf.molp.org\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Local control of public school districts, school vouchers, reduction of non- teaching personnel in public schools, reduction of overall tax rate, elimination of tax on food. Repeal 6 percent gasoline tax for failed 15-year highway plan. Repealing of laws regulating personal/ consensual behavior. Gradual end to the state's ""war on drugs,"" beginning with the legalization of marijuana for medical use. Repeal of gun laws, except those specifically directed at the criminal use thereof.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No. This is just another form of ""corporate welfare,"" which we need to end, not add to.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponents? I view the ""war on drugs"" as being in reality a ""war"" on our civil liberties and a devastating drain on our resources -- human as well as financial. Rather than more police, more courts, more trials, more prisons and more prisoners, I would much rather see far less money spent far more effectively to treat drug addiction and to educate our young on the dangers of drugs. I do not believe it is the government's business to make choices of this kind for its citizens; thus, I would not support criminalizing first-trimester abortions. However, I will always vote against spending taxpayer funds on the procedure, and for outlawing late-term, or ""partial birth"" abortions.\ Green\ Frank Eller Jr.\ Age: 40\ Home: Rock Hill\ Occupation: Admissions counselor, Ranken Technical College\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I will vigorously support proposition B, the Fair Elections Act. I would hope to introduce legislation to publicly fund early childhood education beginning at the age of six months. I will oppose any legislation that interferes with a woman's right to private, safe, and legal reproductive choices. I will support all legislation to require mandatory labeling of all genetically modified food products. In fact, I will fight for increased consumer protections in the workplace and the marketplace.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I will support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals when they support the corporate financing of affordable, low-income housing for the poor.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponents? I do not subscribe to a win/lose mentality when it comes to the election of public servants. Politics is the art of civic self expression. While I have as much of a distaste for defeat as the next person, my hope is not to win, but to expand the debate over the future of our Democracy.\ District 88\ Republican: Neal St. Onge, Ballwin, is unopposed.\ District 89\ Republican: Incumbent William ""Bill"" Linton, Wildwood, is unopposed.\ District 90\ Democrat\ Richard K. ""Rick"" Johnson\ Age: 31\ Home: High Ridge\ Occupation: Lawyer, self-employed\ Political career: Never held public office.\ Campaign Web site: www.rickjohnson2000.com\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I would fight for this district's fair share of transportation and infrastructure dollars. I would fight to protect our seniors by supporting tough laws to crack down on telemarketing scams aimed at the elderly, by supporting a prescription drug benefit, by supporting a freeze on property tax assessments for seniors and by supporting thorough criminal background checks on nursing home workers. I would fight for and protect our children to make them safe at school, home and in our neighborhoods. I would fight for and protect our families by supporting health care reform.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Undecided. My decision on this issue will be forthcoming after a thorough cost-benefit analysis and review of the advantages and disadvantages of this proposal to my district and the residents of Missouri.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I know this district far better than my opponent. Having knocked on over 10,000 doors in this district with my wife in 1998, as well as several thousand already this year, I have walked every street in this district. I know the problems and issues and I know the people. I better represent my district and, as a military veteran serving on nuclear submarines in the U.S. Navy during the Persian Gulf War, I understand commitment, service and discipline. I intend to bring that same level of commitment and service to Jefferson City on behalf of my community.\ Republican\ Byron ""Butch"" Keelin Jr.\ Age: 33\ Home: Fenton\ Occupation: Member relations coordinator, American Optometric Association\ Political career: Never held public office.\ Campaign Web site: www.butchkeelin.org\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? If elected to the state Legislature, I would work to improve our deteriorating roads and bridges. Many children in our district, particularly in Jefferson County, must travel long distances on dangerous roads to get to school. I will also work to eliminate the personal property tax on automobiles. I believe we already pay enough in taxes for our cars (federal and state gas tax, license fee, emission fee, inspection fee and sales tax). We should not have to pay an additional tax when the value of the property (automobile) depreciates.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I do not support the current plan being offered. However, I believe the St. Louis Cardinals are a vital partner in the St. Louis metro area. As state representative, I will evaluate all options and work with St. Louis City, St. Louis County, local businesses and the St. Louis Cardinals to develop a plan that will allow the St. Louis Cardinals the ability to remain competitive.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I believe I should be elected for two reasons. I have a proven track record working for families and businesses. As National Director for the American Student Association of Community Colleges, I worked with Congress and the Missouri Legislature to increase funding for Pell Grants and increased funding in science and math programs at community colleges. The second reason is that I have lived in the Jefferson/St. Louis County area for over 20 years. I know what traffic is like on Highway 30, I know all about the taxes the residents in this area pay to maintain basic services such as fire, ambulance and a well-trained police force. My opponent does not.\ District 91\ Democrat\ John J. Webb\ Age: 44\ Home: Webster Groves\ Occupation: Carpenter/ contractor, Webb Construction, self- employed\ Political career: Never held public office.\ Campaign Web site: hometown.aol.com/johnjwebb91st/\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I will work to ensure that Webster's education system provides quality instruction in a safe and respectful school environment. We must retain and attract well-qualified teaching professionals to Webster by offering competitive salaries. We must modernize our school buildings so that all children have access to the advantages of technology. We must keep students safe while in school so that they can learn.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I would support public involvement in the building of a new stadium, but I would encourage a voluntary program of public financing. St. Louis has a strong record of standing behind their sports teams and this would enable the public to invest in a new stadium without diverting tax dollars from other much needed projects.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I have accumulated real experience by engaging in grassroots citizen action on behalf of the environment, campaign finance reform and issues affecting working families. I have used these experiences to build real, workable solutions for the challenges facing this district. I will support health care reforms that put decisions in the hands of doctors and patients, a Patients' Bill of Rights, protections to guard seniors from telemarketing fraud and reforms to put citizens and not corporations in charge of our elections.\ Republican\ Kathlyn Fares\ Age: 58\ Home: Webster Groves\ Occupation: Sales associate, Fares Interior Furnishings\ Political career: Jefferson Township Republican committeewoman, 1996 and 2000\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? District schools have not had an increase in state formula funding since 1993. I will work to obtain our fair share of all educational funding and to maintain local control. Providing opportunities for small businesses is another priority. I will support state income tax credits for small business owners so that coupled with pooled purchasing power they can afford health care insurance for themselves and employees. I also support and encourage the free enterprise system and economic growth.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? The excitement winning teams have created in the community is wonderful to experience and I support our local teams. However, I have not been privy to the proposal details and feel there is much to be considered. I will study both the proposals made and how other cities' stadiums have been funded, solicit the input of my district and weigh the budget and funding constraints of the state in making a decision.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I have lived and been active in the community for 36 years. I served as the In- District Assistant to our current state representative for ten years. I have a strong commitment to education as well as business, advocacy and political experience. My background, experience and interests make me better qualified to serve all the citizens of our district and our state.\ District 92\ Republican: Charles R.

Byrd, Kirkwood, is unopposed.\ District 95\ Republican: Incumbent Jim Murphy, Crestwood, is unopposed.\ District 96\ Democrat\ Joseph L. Treadway\ Incumbent\ Age: 53\ Home: Lemay\ Occupation: State legislator/ Corporate development\ Political career: Lemay Fire District director, 1980-82; state representative 1982-present\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Health care insurance reform so that people who lose or change jobs cannot be shifted to the high risk pool and priced out of the market. We need to aid working families with their pharmaceutical cost.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? In fairness to the Cardinals, I have not yet seen a detailed plan. But I believe they will have a tough case to prove public benefit.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? My opponent appears to have a very radical political agenda. He is quoted as not believing in Social Security and early childhood programs.\ Republican\ Alan Fasoldt\ Age: 56\ Home: St. Louis County\ Occupation: Consultant, self-employed\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I would work to bring real business or industry into Lemay, reduce taxes and get government out of the way of a person's innate ability to excel.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I believe that we, as individuals, should have the liberty to solve our own problems and exploit our own opportunities. We are the solution, not government. I don't take contributions from any organizations, public or private, so I'm not beholden to them.\ District 97\ Democrat\ Elaine Bennett\ Age: 41\ Home: South St. Louis County\ Occupation: EKG technician, St. Anthony's Medical Center\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Aid in returning health care back in the hands of doctors and patients; host town hall meetings every three to four months; aid in making tax assessor more responsible to the taxpayers.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No. The Cardinal franchise is a privately owned corporation, so therefore I believe that the funding for the new stadium should be up to the owners (private funding).\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? We are all aware that the health care industry needs changes. I believe that those with a health care background should help with that process. With my 20 years of work in the health care field, as well as assisting with my parents' medical needs for many years, I feel I have knowledge from both sides. I also plan on hosting town hall meetings on a regular basis to stay in contact with the citizens of the district. I believe it is important for the people to know what is happening in Jefferson City as well as being able to voice their issues and concerns.\ Republican\ Carl H. Hendrickson\ Incumbent\ Age: 63\ Home: South St. Louis County\ Occupation: Attorney and state legislator\ Political career: State representative, 1994, 1996, 1998\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Education, tax relief and health care. Our schools do not receive their fair share under the state funding formula and this is unfair to our children. The biennial tax assessment is hurting our seniors, and this must be remedied. Affordable, accessible health care is a critical public policy issue. I support 100 percent tax deduction for health insurance premiums.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No. The state has more pressing problems in the areas of education and public health. Our country has prospered under the system of capitalism, where individuals and businesses risk their money in a venture. I would not change this system to build a stadium.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? More core values and beliefs of limited government and fewer taxes are consistent with those of the district's residents. My years of community and legislative service have demonstrated that I care about the area and its residents.\ Democrat\ May Scheve\ Incumbent\ Age: 36\ Home: Grantwood Village\ Occupation: State representative\ Political career: State representative, 98th District, 1990 to present\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Help for Hold Harmless district. For several years, I have been working to pass legislation that would assist school districts that have their funding frozen. One way to assist these schools financially is to collect the CPI annually. This would give districts additional funding to meet the rising cost of education.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I'm willing to review any plan that displayed a balanced approach. We must revitalize downtown St. Louis and we must keep the stadium in the city because it is vital to any economic development plans that may be proposed. It must be a win-win situation for the taxpayers and the region.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponents? I have a proven record of passing legislation that cuts taxes, helps senior citizens and improves education. This is a full-time job for me, and I have become a leader in my community. My constituents can call me and know I will get the job done.\ Republican\ James Avery\ Age: 29\ Home: Affton\ Occupation: Teacher/ basketball coach, Bayless School District\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I will fight to remove the Hold Harmless clause from the school funding formula. The Hold Harmless clause causes our school districts to receive the same amount of money in the year 2000 as they did in 1993. Therefore, Bayless and Affton have lost their bus services and cannot afford to buy enough textbooks for all of their students.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I only support public financing of a new stadium if the voters in the greater St. Louis area support it via a ballot issue.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponents? I should be elected because the Affton area and its schools have been declining during the last ten years while my opponent has been in office. I am pro-life. I would also represent the district better by voting in favor of pro-life issues in the House for the first time in ten years.\ Libertarian\ Mike Chesnut\ Age: 40\ Home: Shrewsbury\ Occupation: Security personnel\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Letting private businesses provide services now done by the State of Missouri, which would allow me to sponsor a bill to repeal the Missouri income taxes.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? To reduce the size of government by doing what I proposed in the first question. I would also sponsor legislation to stop putting parents in jail for not paying child support, since they cannot pay while in jail either. I would propose having a work program in jails, so that non- custodial parents can pay the remaining balance of their child support. I would also sponsor legislation to repeal the mandated vehicle insurance and let insurance companies insure vehicles, plumbers, security personnel, etc. by not licensing them.\ Reform\ Ronald E. Levy\ Age: 71\ Home: Affton\ Occupation: Retired\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? What is really needed in Missouri is to stop big property tax increases. In 1978, California enacted Proposition 13. Since 1978, property taxes in California cannot increase more than one percent in any given year. Missouri needs a Proposition 13. Big reassessment increases on homes in Missouri would stop at one percent. Tax bills could not increase more than one percent on Missouri homes.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponents? I want to do something about the state budget expenditures that my opponent has not been doing. If elected I would never vote to approve the state budget until it is specified that all school-age children are treated the same and receive an equal amount of state money for their education. This is something I can honestly say I can do if elected.\ District 99\ Democrat\ Gloria Weber\ Age: 67\ Home: South St. Louis County\ Occupation: Clergy, Lutheran Church in America, retired\ Political career: Missouri House of Representatives, District 99, 1992.\ Campaign Web site: www.gloriaweber2000.com\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I will take action on voters' concerns and needs. First is legislation to lower prescription drug prices. Maine and Massachusetts have already passed laws that are expected to save residents at least 25 percent. The New England states are considering cooperative action. Second is work to secure tax credits for tuition at Missouri's public colleges and universities. Public money for public schools. Third is action to secure 100 percent tax deductions for all health care costs.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No, using the current proposal, I would not.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? Rep. Enz's voting record contradicts her words. Claiming to support voters, not government control, she voted no to allowing citizens to vote, in referendum, on the concealed carry issue and no to ending court- ordered desegregation in St. Louis and Kansas City. Claiming to be pro-family, she voted no to the Children's Health Care Initiative and no to requiring children to receive immunizations for chicken pox and Hepatitis A prior to entering school. Claiming to be pro-small business, she voted no to opening the state's managed health care system to small business and farmers. I would have voted yes on these bills.\ Republican\ Catherine S. Enz\ Incumbent\ Age: 46\ Home: South St. Louis County\ Occupation: Legislator\ Political career: State representative, 99th District, 1994, 1996, 1998\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? My goal has always been to represent constituents with conservative representation which brings significant tax relief, less government regulation and better laws, not more. Along with less taxes and limited government, pro-life voice for unborn babies.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? On public record as voting against public funds for sports facility.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? Six years of legislative experience. Qualified. My candidacy offers the choice to the voters to elect someone who is honest, has an earned reputation of integrity and is a keeper of the public trust.\ District 100\ Democrat\ Joan Barry\ Incumbent\ Age: 59\ Home: Oakville\ Occupation: Registered nurse, St. Anthony's Medical Center\ Political career: State representative, 1996 to present\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? There are several areas of benefit to Oakville residents through legislation. Decreasing the cost of prescription drugs and direct access to physicians of choice, a change in education funding to allow more revenue to ""Hold Harmless"" districts such as Mehlville and relief in regard to property taxes.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? The initial proposal was presented to the Legislature late in our last session. While I do recognize the need to compete economically with other cities and the consideration of incentives to keep businesses in St. Louis as we do to lure new business to the area, more study needs to be done in the areas of current club profit, investment the club would make and tax revenue that would be generated.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? As a 36-year active resident of Oakville, I feel I know my community and its needs. Having served in the Missouri House for five years, I have gained experience and seniority to represent my constituents well. I feel I have been responsive to constituent problems and have been successful in passing legislation dealing with domestic violence, improving the quality of patient care, ending elderly abuse and neglect and decreasing taxes.\ Republican\ Denny Hettenhausen\ Age: 42\ Home: Oakville\ Occupation: Housewife\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? I will work hard to promote local control of our schools. I will strive to help our schools receive the necessary funding to operate efficiently and comfortably without burdensome government regulations and strings attached. I will not support abortion as my opponent did when she voted for a pro-choice speaker of the house. I will fight to end partial birth abortion and protect the innocent life of the unborn.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I am in favor of building a new stadium. I think all options should be brought to the table so that we can find the most equitable proposal. We need a solution that is fair to the taxpayers while promoting economic development.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? Recently, the South County community experienced division among the residents as a direct result of many of our elected officials receiving major contributio ns from the gambling industry and it's investors. I believe that public officials cannot serve both special interest groups and the public that elected them. Regardless of which side of an issue one stands on, everyone deserves to be represented fairly and honestly by their elected officials. I will be a leader in Jefferson City who will stand for public good and support my stand by taking action.\ District 101\ Democrat\ Kate Hollingsworth\ Incumbent\ Age: 40\ Home: Imperial\ Occupation: Legislator\ Political career: State representative, 1996, 1998; Windsor Township Democratic committeewoman, 1994-present\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? My commitment to Jefferson County families would continue to be my focus. I was on their side when I wrote and passed the Family Care Safety Act, supported Missouri's Patient Bill of Rights, HMO accountability and when I supported the telemarketing bill. If re- elected, I will again be on their side to protect their privacy.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Keeping the St. Louis Cardinals in St. Louis should be a genuine economic concern for the region and the state. However, I am not yet convinced that the public financing of a new stadium is necessary. As with all legislation, I will listen to and study both sides of the issue before deciding whether to support or oppose any specific proposal.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I should be re-elected because of the service I have provided to my constituents, my experience of writing and passing legislation and the commitment to study and deliberate on the tough issues facing families.\ Republican\ David Spears\ Age: 31\ Home: Imperial\ Occupation: Youth minister, Craig Road Baptist Church, also Army National Guard\ Political career: Never held public office.\ Campaign Web site: www.davidspears.org\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Education is a huge priority to me, and I would like to work to bring more funds to our school for teachers and students. I would also work to get the funds to complete the highway and interstate systems in our area as well as other infrastructures including funds to improve our sewer system.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? I think having the different sports teams in the St. Louis area is important to the business and residential communities. However, I do not think that it is appropriate for legislators to decide for the residents if they will finance a new stadium or not. We must bring this to a vote of the people in the city and counties.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I believe it is important to have someone representing the community who can reflect the values and concerns of the community. I believe that I am more in touch with my community. Also I believe that people want someone who will vote for them and not special interest groups outside our area. I promise to work for the people.\ District 102\ Democrat\ Ryan McKenna\ Incumbent\ Age: 27\ Home: Barnhart\ Occupation: State representative\ Political career: Glaize Creek Sewer Board, April 1997; State representative, November 1998 to present\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? 1. I feel issues that would benefit my constituency are road improvements and new construction with the main focus being safety (esp. Highways 55, 21, MM, and W). 2. Continue to fully fund public education through the appropriation process. 3. Economic development will benefit Jefferson County by allowing our sales tax dollars to remain in the county.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? There are a number of current financial incentives that are utilized in the city of St. Louis. The baseball team, as well as any other entity, are welcomed to access those, as long as they qualify. It would be up to the St. Louis Board of Aldermen to determine where the ball club fits in. I certainly wouldn't want the St. Louis city public school system to suffer any financial loss.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I feel that I understand the intricacies of the political process better because of my experience as a state representative. I currently serve on the Appropriations Committee of Economic Development and Natural Resources, Transportation Committee, Labor Committee, Public Safety/ Law Enforcement Committee, and Elderly Abuse and Neglect subcommittee. I stay involved in the community and I will continue to do so. For example, since being elected to office in November 1998, I have talked to approximately 2,000 students in schools inside my district.\ Republican\ Lew Hayes\ Age: 59\ Home: Northern Jefferson County\ Occupation: Senior financial accountant, Sunnen Products Co.\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would b ring the most benefit to the residents of your district?

More help to our infrastructure needs. Accessible health insurance and affordable prescription drugs for seniors and disabled.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals?

Lower taxes. 2. Stabilize shoulders on highways and make turn lanes to facilitate a more safe and even flow of traffic. 3. Public sewer system. 4. Work for renewed commitment to the 15-year highway plan. 5. Eliminate present form of emissions test.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? Education, health care, prescription drugs, crime, transportation and public sewer system are all quality of life and life-threatening issues. A new stadium is not life threatening, and I don't support it at this time.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? Higher taxes with bigger and less responsive government continues to manifest itself. It's time for character proven checks and balances to return to government. Keep the promises to the people.\ District 104\ Democrat: Incumbent Wes Wagner is unopposed.\ District 105\ Democrat\ Harold R.

Improved highways. I have several improvement projects already started and want to continue to get our roads safe and repaired. Finally work has started on Highway MM/W. I want to get Highway 30 improved now from St. Louis County to St. Clair.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No. I can't ask the taxpayers in my district to support a new stadium until they have safe roads just to get to the existing ball park. We have sewer problems that also need addressing in this district before we can think about a place to play ball.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I refuse all campaign contributions. I refuse all gifts and money from lobbyists. No other senator or representative or my opponent can make these statements. My wife Becky, me and our two children are lifelong residents of the 105th District. We own our own home and pay taxes. I have visited most every home in my district and know their concerns.\ Republican\ Quenten L. Wills\ Age: 35\ Home: High Ridge\ Occupation: Telecommunications, AT&T\ Political career: Never held public office.\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? We need to send education dollars directly to our local school systems and bypass the federal and state bureaucracies. It is the teachers and parents that will improve education, not government. Also, I would like to see prison time for first time convictions of ""meth"" dealers.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? If the Cardinal ownership can show me how the people of Jefferson County will benefit.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I am a pro- life conservative who supports smaller government. My opponent is a ""big government liberal"" who caters to left-wing organizations.\ District 108\ Democrat\ Thomas Albert Villa\ Age: 55\ Home: St. Louis\ Occupation: Full-time campaigner\ Political career: Missouri House of Representatives, 1974-1984; President, St. Louis Board of Aldermen, 1987-1995\ If elected to the state legislature, what would you seek that would bring the most benefit to the residents of your district? Education: Assure funding of oversight committee in SB 781; Transportation: Renew effort to prioritize needs and identify funding sources. Transfer over 70 miles of St. Louis arterial roads to the state. Convince the Legislature to make mass transit part of the total plan. Bi-State Development Agency needs more state money. Fine- tune existing auto emission requirements. Tax Increment Financing: Limit to truly blighted areas. Redirect investments to the city and areas in need of development. Tobacco Settlement Money: The state will receive $6.5 billion. Appropriate to city health care.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? The city clearly has a financial interest in keeping the taxes generated by 3 million people watching the Cardinals at 81 games per season. Diverting part of the state sales tax that the stadium generates toward partial payment for a new stadium makes economic sense. Tax increment financing could supplement the public contribution. A public-private partnership provides jobs, civic growth, family entertainment and revenue that vibrant cities require. Rather than a short-sighted attempt to punish success, I want to participate in it. Yes.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? The population loss in the city of St. Louis will result in the loss of a number of Missouri House seats. My experience in the legislative process and my proven track record in government service make me the superior candidate. The city of St. Louis has to have strong representation in Jefferson City.\ Republican\ Ray Stephens\ No response received\ District 109\ Democrat\ Donald J.

Suspend the sale of reformulated gasoline in the St. Louis metro area until ethanol or another additive can be found. 4. A workable solution to our crumbling highway system.\ Do you support public financing of a new stadium for the Cardinals? No. I have not spoken to anyone who is in favor of this proposal. Everyone I have spoken to feels that if the Cardinal owners want a new stadium, no tax money should be involved. Therefore, I would not support state tax money building a new stadium. However, I am open to the possibility of assisting with repairs and renovations to the existing stadium.\ Why should you be elected rather than your opponent? I have the experience, dedication and leadership abilities to best represent my constituents. My greatest asset is my personality.

227," Before Cheryl Marcum moved back to Missouri from the suburbs of Washington, she and her husband spent years studying ways to make their southwest Missouri home among the state's most energy efficient.\ Along with soy-foam insulation, Energy Star appliances and other design elements meant to minimize energy use, their 3,700-square- foot house has solar panels on the roof to help run the dishwasher, computer and other appliances. On sunny days, the couple often have a little extra electricity to put back on the grid.\ By generating their own electricity, the Marcums are among a small but growing number of Missourians choosing to offset their energy consumption with small-scale renewable power systems to help lessen the nation's dependence on coal, oil and natural gas and cut emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas linked to global warming.\ But producing power is one thing; selling it is another. Marcum and others with solar- and wind-power systems in Missouri say they've had a difficult time reaching terms with utilities that would enable them to put excess generation back on the grid.\ ""We thought we knew exactly what we needed to do and then everything fell apart,"" she said. ""This has taken seven months, countless telephone calls, countless e-mails. It's got to be easier.""\ Missouri enacted a law in 2002 establishing standards for customers who want to connect to the grid. But renewable-energy advocates, environmentalists and legislators say the state's rules are too cumbersome and fall short of their intended goals.\ ""It's a very convoluted process that varies from utility to utility,"" said state Rep. Jason Holsman, D-Kansas City. Complaints about the current process prompted Holsman to sponsor the Easy Connection Act, which would make it simpler for homeowners and businesses to connect to the grid. The Illinois Legislature is considering a similar measure, sponsored by Rep. Naomi Jakobsson, D- Champaign.\ The bills have strong support from environmentalists because Missouri and Illinois are among just nine states without true ""net metering"" standards, according to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, which tracks renewable-energy policies and incentives.\ ""Forty-one states have already done it and it's shown to be successful, so it's the low-hanging fruit,"" said Erin Noble, outreach and development director for the Missouri Coalition for the Environment.\ The utility industry in Missouri doesn't oppose net metering but wants to make sure the state is careful to require customers pushing electricity back onto the grid to meet certain standards, said Chuck Caisley, president of the Missouri Energy Development Association, the trade group representing investor-owned utilities.\ ""Our biggest concern is that the system is safe and reliable,"" Caisley said.\ Illinois gets just 1.9 percent of its electricity from renewable sources such as wind and sun. In Missouri, it's just a fraction of 1 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the Energy Department.\ In fact, Missouri had only two residential net metering customers in 2005, the most recent data available. By contrast, California had more than 17,000. Other leading states include New Jersey, Oregon and Montana, though the numbers of customers selling power back to utilities in those states can be measured by the hundreds, not thousands.\ Cost is the biggest reason that development of small-scale renewable energy systems has been so limited, said Warren Wood, head of utility operations for the Missouri Public Service Commission staff.\ A two- to three-kilowatt solar power system costs $15,000 to $30,000. While there's a $2,000 federal tax credit available to help defray the cost, there are no state tax incentives available in Missouri, and electricity rates in the state are lower than in many others, such as California, Texas and Northeast states.\ Tony Loman of Kirkwood installed a one-kilowatt solar power system in his home last July. Like Marcum, he has yet to reach an agreement to sell excess power back to the municipal electric supplier, but he hopes to do so soon.\ Loman, a sociologist, decided to install solar panels not to make money, but because he has had a long-standing interest in the environment, and he has become increasingly concerned about the direction of the nation's energy policy.\ ""I feel like this is the wave of the future,"" he said. ""I also feel a social responsibility to push this kind of thing.""\ Ditto for Gary Steps, a retired IBM engineer who now runs an energy consulting business.\ While solar systems like his are out of reach for many homeowners, the economics are changing, he said. Prices for coal and natural gas have been climbing in recent years and costs of solar and wind-power systems are dropping as technologies advance and manufacturers benefit from economies of scale.\ Sitting at the kitchen table of his home in Webster Groves, Steps can monitor a computer system that tracks how much electricity his 2.1-kilowatt solar system is generating (205 kilowatts since March 1); how much backup power is stored by the battery system in his basement (12.4 hours); and how much carbon dioxide he has prevented from being vented into the atmosphere by generating some of his own electricity (335.5 pounds).\ Steps thinks a carbon tax or other similar regulation being considered by Congress could further raise prices for power from coal-fired power plants and make solar and wind-power systems more feasible for consumers.\ Steps, in fact, said he is ready to ""double down"" on his solar investment if the economics improve. ""If that were to happen next year, you'd see me put another set of panels up,"" he said.\ ---\ NET METERING LEADERS\ State Number of participants\ California 17,427\ New Jersey 604\ Wisconsin 240\ Minnesota 193\ Nevada 188\ Texas 163\ Vermont 164\ SOURCE: Energy Information Administration\ ---\ STLtoday.com/links\ Read the electric energy bill.\ Credit: Jeffrey Tomich; ST.

228," Q: With potential Y2K power outages and just normal ones due to storms, summer brownouts, etc., I am considering adding a PV system to my house. What do you think of this and do you have any tips? - Russ A.\ A: Installing a PV (photovoltaic) electricity-generating system is an effective method to provide electricity during power outages. PV systems use solar cells that convert the sun's rays into electricity. Some small systems, such as Evergreen, are sold as complete simple- to-install homeowner kits.\ There have been improvements in solar-cell efficiency and the costs have dropped. If your house needs a new roof, consider solar shingles. Solar cells are built into the shingles. These solar shingles are attached with nails just like ordinary shingles.\ Solar-cell panels are thin, lightweight and easy to handle. They can be tilted up on the roof or laid flat against it so they are barely visible from the ground.\ Since a PV system continuously generates electricity during daylight hours, at times it will produce more electricity than you need. Some of the excess electricity is used to keep several deep- draw backup batteries charged.\ In many states and municipalities, utility companies must offer net metering billing. For your home, this means that your electric meter slows down or runs in reverse when the PV system is generating electricity.\ The primary reasons to install a PV system are for backup electricity or concern for the environment and your children's future. PV systems are silent, require very little maintenance - no moving parts - and create no pollution.\ To plan a PV system, first determine the power usage of the appliances you need to keep running during an emergency. This often includes the refrigerator, a water or sump pump, lights and a radio or TV. With Y2K problems occurring in January, you may want to include your furnace blower.\ The total of the wattages of these necessary electrical appliances determines the size of the battery pack that is required. During a power outage at night, all the electricity comes from the batteries. During the day, the solar panels provide electricity and keep the batteries charged.\ Knowing the total wattage also determines the number of PV solar- cell panels needed. This varies depending on the solar-cell technology you choose, your budget and the amount of sun energy available in your area of the country.\ The two basic types of PV solar cells are crystalline and thin film. Crystalline has proven reliability, and some kits have a 20- year warranty. Thin film is newer and less expensive but requires larger panels and more area.\ Write for bulletin 812, a buyer's guide of PV systems, kits, PV shingle manufacturers, selection/sizing guide and prices. Send $3 and a business-size stamped, addressed envelope to James Dulley, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati 45244. Computer users can download at www.dulley.com.\ Q: We use our central air conditioner most of the summer. We have screen/storm doors and we leave the glass in year-round for security. Is the weatherstripping important and how can we tell if it's OK? - Mandy N.\ A: Although the condition of the weatherstripping on a storm door is not as important as on your primary door, it helps lower your utility bills if it seals well. The crack around the glass panels is often the most leaky area.\ First adjust the storm-door latch so that it closes as tightly as possible without hanging open. Pull your primary door open quickly. If you feel a suction air resistance as you pull it open, the storm door is sealing well."
229,"Farmer Jatin Kumar relies on kerosene to light his house in Fateh Nagla, India, a small village 200 miles southeast of New Delhi. He's one of more than 300 million people without access to electricity in the Asian nation a number equivalent to the entire population of the United States. \Half a world away, University of Missouri grad student Alec Pickett is among researchers working to ease the struggles of people such as Kumar by studying ways to improve solar technology, using parts made in India. \If all goes well, their research could someday lead to lighter, more portable and cheaper solar cells to power the lives of people in some of the world's poorest, most remote places.\""Say that you have someone living in a tent,"" Pickett said. ""You can have roll-up sheets of the solar cells, put them on top of your roof, secure them down, and generate your electricity that way.""\Pickett's work comes amid growing interest in solar energy in both the United States and India. America's solar industry, which promoters say provided one in 50 new jobs last year, aims to generate 100 gigawatts of installed solar capacity enough energy to power almost 17 million homes. India intends to generate the same amount of power, which studies show could create a million jobs there by 2022.\Besides sparking the economy, environmentalists say these efforts could slow climate change by reducing dependence on fossil fuels.\Mike Hornitschek, director of strategic development at an 11-year-old environmental company in St. Louis called StraightUp Solar, said energy from the sun had many advantages.\""Solar energy is better because it's renewable, and you can use existing distribution systems,"" he said. ""It'll continue to improve and get cheaper.""\But the path toward a solar-powered future is not without obstacles. There's business uncertainty, such as the bankruptcy of Maryland Heights-based SunEdison, the largest U.S. bankruptcy filing of 2016, which rippled through the world. And there are changing environmental policies. Whereas former President Barack Obama wholeheartedly supported renewable energy, President Donald Trump has expressed far more support for coal, oil and gas.\""There are people that are now in charge of a regulatory structure that are ignoring the science, and that's troubling,"" said Bret Fanshaw, solar program coordinator for Environment America, an organization that raises awareness of environmental issues in the U.S. ""I hope states won't bend to the will of some powerful forces that are trying to keep us hooked on old and dirty sources of power.""\INVESTING IN A SOLAR FUTURE\In Missouri and across the United States, solar energy capacity is projected to triple over the next five years, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.\One of the trade group's sister organizations, The Solar Foundation, said jobs in the solar field had grown 25 percent in 2016, reaching the 1-in-50 figure last year.\Solar power is now the cheapest renewable form of energy in the world, surpassing wind, Fanshaw said.\Solar power's increasing popularity can be largely attributed to net metering, which is the way utilities credit solar power users for all the leftover energy their solar panels create but don't use.\""(Net metering) helps people save money on their bill by earning that extra credit back,"" Fanshaw said. ""There's also tax credits for solar. There is a federal tax credit that I think is 30 percent of the cost of your system that you can write off.""\Against this backdrop, U.S. solar installations have climbed from 1,000 to 7,000 a year in five years, the solar trade group said. The increasing visibility of solar panels encourages more people to install them and support renewable energy.\""The more people who go solar and see it around their communities,"" Fanshaw said, ""the more people are invested in the clean energy future that we need.""\Pickett's investment in that future grew from an interest in basic science. At first, his research stemmed from a desire to understand the behavior of polymers, the chain of molecules in charge of absorbing light and turning it into current. He works 40 hours a week in his lab with synthesized organic polymers sent from the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore.\""The cool thing about organics is that they are cheap, light and flexible,"" Pickett said. ""Apart from roll-up panels, you can have windows made out of transparent solar cells.""\They're low-cost and easy to distribute, he said, and could potentially benefit people across the world when engineers transform the raw technology into consumer goods.\""Organics are being used, but there aren't optimized yet,"" he said. ""After the research and the written publications are done, the job of the engineers would be to apply that system to a product, and that could take over a decade.""\INDIA'S HIGH EXPECTATIONS\Such products would fill a huge need in India.\Already, growing numbers of families have started using solar energy to heat their homes, cook their meals and study at night. But lightweight panels could really help them. Most live in houses that can't support the weight of traditional, inorganic panels made of heavier material.\""We are still using kerosene lamps to see something in the dark,"" said Nagla, the farmer. ""After sunset, kids in the village start studying (by the light of) kerosene lamps, because they don't have any other option. It's our only source of light inside our houses, and for outside needs, there's just moonlight.""\Scientists in India, like those in America, are looking toward the future by working on lighter, smaller, more efficient solar panels and cells.\These include ""floating solar panels,"" said Gon Chaudhuri, chairman of Renewable Energy College in Kolkata, India. ""India has a lot of water bodies. Even if we capture just 5 percent of them, we can generate 300 gigawatts of solar power.""\Indian scientists are also working on devices called micro-solar domes, which capture light from the sun but don't need electricity.\""This micro solar dome can concentrate that daylight in a dark room, which is useful for rural areas which lack electricity supply,"" Chaudhuri said.\While there are no guarantees that all the research will pan out or that political or business realities won't interfere many solar advocates are optimistic that people without electricity may soon get the power they need from the sun.\With strong worldwide support for renewable energy, Hornitschek said, ""there's no reason why we shouldn't go solar.""\---\STORY PROJECTS\As part of a University of Missouri journalism class last semester, six teams of students worked on story projects, including this one, that connected India and Missouri. They worked under the direction of Laura Ungar, investigative and enterprise reporter for USA Today and The Courier-Journal, and journalist Sujoy Dhar, a former Reuters correspondent and founder of the Indian news agency India Blooms, based in Kolkata, India.

230,"In Jefferson City on Thursday, an evangelical group that opposes abortion submitted a petition calling on Missouri to improve air quality through policies that promote renewable energy.\Called the Missouri Pro-Life Clean Energy Petition, the grass-roots initiative has gathered the names of 19,291 state residents so far, including a reported 1,995 or approximately 10 percent from the St. Louis area.\The effort represents an unlikely push from a movement that often finds itself on the opposite end of the political spectrum from traditional environmentalists. But the petition's organizers are hoping to eliminate divides when it comes to the environment, which they say has become a needlessly partisan issue.\""We would like policymakers here in Missouri to know that this is not (just) a progressive issue,"" said the Rev. Mitch Hescox, a Pennsylvania-based pastor and president of the Evangelical Environmental Network, a nationwide organization behind the campaign.\He says that promoting renewable energy represents the best way to protect children ""born and unborn"" from air quality issues tied to the use of fossil fuels. The Evangelical Environmental Network's website cites an American Lung Association report card that gave only one eligible Missouri county a grade above an 'F' for ozone pollution, with St. Louis' levels ranking as the 18th-worst among U.S. cities.\The organization's petition advocates for specific policy goals including better efficiency standards, making net metering more affordable, and entering into power purchase agreements with renewable energy projects. Renew Missouri, a nonprofit energy policy group based in Columbia, helped tailor the petition to state energy issues.\Missouri is the sixth state in which the Evangelical Environmental Network has advanced its Pro-Life Clean Energy Campaign. Looking ahead, Hescox said, the organization wants to double the number of signatories for the Missouri petition.\""This is just the beginning,"" he says. ""We'll be back in a month or so to do more presentations at evangelical communities.""\Credit: By Bryce Gray; St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
231,"When it comes to energy generation, business as usual is hurting Missouri. Antiquated state laws are holding back investments in cheaper, cleaner electricity from renewable sources. The state's biggest job creators have voiced concerns that they would like to build and buy renewable energy through stable, long-term contracts, as is possible in other states. Thousands of jobs for the construction and operation of locally sourced renewable power are left on the sidelines.\That's why Cargill, General Mills, Unilever and Wal-Mart are asking for new state laws that will let them purchase more cheap and clean renewable power, such as wind and solar. These businesses and others are required under current law to purchase power from the state's utilities, preventing them from pursuing cleaner or lower-cost options available from renewable-energy providers. In what industry besides energy is every business required to buy a product from a single provider, even when there are better, more affordable options available?\More than that, business as usual is hurting Missourians where it counts most: their children's health. All but one Missouri county for which there is information gets a grade of ""F"" for smog from the American Lung Association. St. Louis ranks as the 18th-most-polluted metropolitan area in the country. This puts the 156,000 Missouri children with asthma at greater risk for missing school and being hospitalized, and jeopardizes the health of 2 million Missourians with serious health conditions. Our faith makes it imperative to defend our children and deliver them a healthier, more sustainable future.\Missouri can be a leader in clean energy. Our groups believe conservatives have the genuine interest and tools to lead the charge and make that future clearer and more achievable. Whether it's our evangelical faith or a faith in the power of markets, we agree that, with the right changes, Missouri can create a cleaner, more competitive future.\In late July, the Evangelical Environmental Network delivered to Gov. Jay Nixon and legislative leaders the names of more than 19,000 Christians in Missouri who support a significant increase in renewable power in the state. They see that new technologies can clean up our environment, improve our children's health and build a more sustainable future if we allow the market to flourish.\There's a clear way forward, and it starts with simple changes. The state's utilities can only provide the types of power that legislators and regulators permit. But individual citizens and companies demand more access to clean power. Let's empower Missouri businesses to choose alternative sources and build a market for renewable energy.\To deliver better, cleaner options to Missouri's companies, the state should support a new legislative push to allow businesses to buy power from renewable-energy providers. Introduced by state Rep. Bill Kidd, R-Independence, this bill would remove restrictions on Power Purchase Agreements. Such arrangements allow new, in-state investments in clean, low-cost renewable power, bring in high-skilled job opportunities, and give businesses access to a reliable, long-term source of electricity.\It's clean energy driven by cost-competitiveness and commitment to sustainability, not government mandates.\We can do better by households, too. Current policy supports net metering, which allows individual customers to offset their own power usage with wind or solar at home and sell it back to the utility. But two limits the size of at-home units and the low price customers can fetch for excess power keep the program out of reach for all but the most motivated customers. A 2015 study from the Missouri Energy Initiative found that net-metering programs provide a benefit to all utility customers, suggesting the whole state stands to gain from a healthier program.\Whether it's a commitment to free markets or a deeply held interest in making investments that will make our air cleaner and our communities healthier, it's clear that Missouri stands to gain from these changes. These kinds of new solutions challenge the traditional model of state-regulated power utilities and create opportunities for more competition, freer markets and a better future for Missouri.\Rev. Mitch Hescox is the president and CEO of Evangelical Environmental Network. Catrina Rorke is director of energy policy and a senior fellow at the R Street Institute."
232,"JEFFERSON CITY -- A group of Springfieldians were among those marshaled by the Sierra Club on Wednesday to advocate for and against legislation that could affect Missouri's environment.\Sierra Club organizer Michael Berg gathered several dozen people in a hearing room and gave them their marching orders: They were to divide into more than two dozen teams, arm themselves with facts and talking points, and disperse throughout the Capitol for more than 170 meetings with lawmakers or staff.\The nonprofit organization is advocating against several legislative proposals, including a net metering bill that would increase costs for people with solar panels on their roofs, a utility omnibus bill, a plan to sell back land the state bought with lead-mining settlement money and a bill that opponents say could allow utility companies to avoid repairing environmental damage.\Jennifer Conner, the Sierra Club's Ozarks conservation program coordinator, told the News-Leader she was happy with the day's work educating lawmakers. As an example, she said she was able to talk to Rep. Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, about the truth of how the money obtained through the lead-mining settlement could be spent.\Several lawmakers were upset that the state bought up land outside of the affected area and converted these parcels into state parks, including the Eleven Point State Park and Ozark Mountain State Park. Conner said she understands the concern but noted that the settlement did indeed call for some new land to be bought ""to make up for the natural resources that were damaged.""\""We have been trying to explain that to legislators, because we feel after talking with them that there's a lot of confusion as to where the money is coming from,"" she said. ""So that's a really big issue for us. State parks are huge in Missouri.""\Conner also highlighted issues the Sierra Club has with the net metering bill, which she said would ""kill solar in Missouri."" The proposal, House Bill 340, would allow utility companies to charge extra maintenance fees to solar customers hooked up to the public grid.\""We don't think that's good,"" she said. ""We think that's a step backwards.""\After a few hours roaming the halls and trying to sway lawmakers ahead of upcoming votes, several dozen activists congregated on the Capitol steps. In addition to expressing gratitude for Sen. Claire McCaskill and calling to action Sen. Roy Blunt, they met to speak with Logan Spena, deputy policy director for Gov. Eric Greitens.\Spena did not answer the group's questions about topics including the state Public Service Commission (which regulates utilities), the Clean Water Commission, whether Grietens had a comprehensive energy plan or what the governor considered Missouri's most pressing environmental issue.\But Spena, who said his policy work for Greitens had mostly been related to labor and education issues, was able to answer a few questions. He told the crowd he had previously worked for a solar company and said while solar was more viable than in the past, he wasn't sure about the level of financial incentives that would be available for future development.\Spena, cognizant that ""Republican"" and ""environmentalist"" don't always go hand in hand, stressed his personal concern for environmental issues and expressed a desire to work with the Sierra Club, whose members tend to be more liberal.\""It's often true that we kind of have assumptions that there's going to be kind of a partisan divide"" on environmental issues, Spena said. ""This is something I want to move away from."""

234,"""It's something that I think businesses are slowly waking up to, that there is a business angle to going solar.""\Jason Fulp\Marketing Manager at Missouri Sun Solar\""After the tax benefits, it is possible that the real outlay will be more like $65,000-$70,000. That sounds like a lot, but we spend an average of $800 a month on electricity, so that adds up to real money.""\Christopher McNeese\Owner, A&B Cycle\Christopher McNeese, owner of A&B Cycle, had been interested in installing solar panels at the south Springfield bike shop for years before he finally learned enough about the process to move forward with it this past fall.\Crews with Houston-based Missouri Sun Solar began installing 256 rooftop panels at the business in November. McNeese expects the output will ultimately supply 99 percent of A&B's power needs.\""We do our best to take care of people,"" McNeese said. ""Sometimes that means tuning their bicycle. Sometimes that means doing our part to improve the air quality for our community.""\Solar panels aren't a new product. But demand for them in southwest Missouri surged in 2015, according to area installers, thanks largely to a ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court. In February, the court ruled that Joplin-based Empire Electric District had to give rebates to customers with qualifying solar installations, in accordance with a ballot measure approved by Missouri voters in 2008.\In addition to having the direct effect of increasing demand for solar panels among Empire customers, installers say, the decision attracted new companies to the area that advertised widely. Those marketing efforts drew attention to other incentives that can subsidize the installation of solar panels, which in turn increased demand even among those in the area who aren't hooked up to Empire's electric grid.\""With the Empire rebates, really the floodgates opened up,"" said Derek West, owner of Springfield-based Solar Energy Services.\An industry boosted by company and federal incentives can retract when it comes time for them to expire. But the national solar industry got a big boost in that respect in late December.\Evidence of solar's 2015 boost\As of mid-December, Missouri Sun Solar, which plans to move its headquarters to Springfield, was on track to finish 2015 with revenue of $22 million, according to Marketing Manager Jason Fulp. That was up from about $3 million in 2014, the company's first full year of business. Republic-based Skywire Electrical Systems, meanwhile, saw solar installations triple from 2014 to 2015, owner James Bartley said.\""Solar has been a slow, evolving thing,"" Bartley said. ""The last year it's really picked up pace.""\The vast majority of installations are residential. But as A&B indicates, a handful of commercial projects, along with work for area school districts, are in the mix. In 2015, Missouri Sun Solar also installed panels at five Myer Hotels properties in Branson, along with Mercy Hospital in Joplin and Keen Eye Antique Mall in Ozark.\""It's something that I think businesses are slowly waking up to, that there is a business angle to going solar,"" Fulp said.\Skywire installed solar panels on the roof of the Offices of O'Reilly and Wooten at 2831 S. Ingram Mill Road in early 2015. Charlie O'Reilly, a board member for Springfield-based O'Reilly Automotive, told the News-Leader he believes the $51,000 rooftop system, designed to offset about 75 percent of the building's energy needs because of space constraints, would likely pay for itself in about 10 years, and then the savings would begin. But he also stressed the environmental aspect of the purchase.\""It's pretty much proven at this point that our world, our country, our community, have got to start the transition from coal-fired electricity,"" he said.\When Springfield Public Schools opened the new Sherwood Elementary in August, the building was outfitted with a ""starter"" set of solar panels, and the district said it was searching for a funding source to add more. In October, the 475-student Greenfield school district in Dade County took things a step further, saying it would spend $676,000 to install enough solar panels so that as close to 100 percent as possible of its energy needs were coming from solar.\""We are a small school district in a small town,"" Superintendent Jeff Davis said at the time, ""this is the best way to not only raise new funds for the district but also to provide a solid foundation of revenue for the future.""\A local industry's turning points\Prior to founding Solar Energy Services in 2014, West worked for years with Springfield-based Power Source Solar. After almost a decade of installing solar panels locally, he points to a few turning points in the business.\When West first started out, he said, he largely installed panels that had some sort of battery, which could hold excess energy produced while the sun was shining for use when it wasn't. That's because panels generally weren't connected to an electric grid. Customers were largely survivalist types, West said, or those committed to alternative energy.\In 2007, the Missouri legislature passed the Easy Connection Act, which went into effect in October 2008. The law required utilities to allow residential solar units to be connected to the grid and to set up what is known as ""net metering,"" in which any additional energy produced by the system is put back into the grid, and the customer receives credit on their bill for the energy produced. This brought solar installers a new customer base, West said, of financially minded individuals -- those who did the math and thought they would see savings.\In November 2008, Missouri voters passed Proposition C, the Renewable Energy Standard. The law required the state's investor-owned utilities to offer solar rebates for new or expanded systems.\That increased demand for solar energy systems in areas serviced by investor-owned utilities like Lake Ozark-based Ameren Missouri, West said. But things didn't immediately change in southwest Missouri. Joplin-based Empire Electric is investor-owned, but the company argued that another law, passed by the state legislature in May 2008, had made the utility exempt from any solar requirements created in the future. In ruling against the utility in February, the Missouri Supreme Court said that exemption was actually repealed by Proposition C.\""Empire customers will now enjoy the same economic benefits of solar energy as seen elsewhere in Missouri,"" Heather Navarro, executive director of the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, said in February.\The Empire effect\The Empire rebates went into effect in May. Thirty-seven Empire customers who already had a solar system up and running qualified for the biggest rebates, up to $2 per watt if their system was operational before July 2014. For new systems, Empire was set to pay a rebate of $1 per watt for approved applications received by the end of 2015, in which the system becomes operational by the end of this June. Bartley, of Skywire, estimated the average residence is paying about $3 a watt for a system to be installed.\The Empire rebate decreased with the start of the new year. Applications received in 2016 through 2018 are eligible for a rebate of 50 cents per watt, and 2019 applications will be eligible for a 25-cent rebate. The company has drawm attention to the fact that all of its customers are paying for rebates offered to a few.\""The cost of solar rebates affects all our Missouri customers,"" Empire Director of Corporate Communications Julie Maus told the News-Leader in August. ""Solar power is to the benefit of those who can afford it.""\Fulp, Barley and West all attributed the increase in demand in 2015 in large part to the Empire rebate. But not all of their solar installations are being done for Empire customers. A&B Cycle, like other Springfield businesses, gets it power through City Utilities. Because CU is taxpayer-owned, not investor-owned, it doesn't have to offer rebates (the utility has a solar initiative of its own).\But there are other incentives of which A&B and O'Reilly took advantage. Under a program that had been set to expire at the end of 2016, any individual, family or business can claim a 30 percent tax credit for the cost of a solar system. And businesses can claim the cost of installation of a solar system as a depreciation expense over five years, as they would be able to for other major business-related expenses.\""Our system will cost $153,000,"" McNeese said. ""After the tax benefits, it is possible that the real outlay will be more like $65,000-$70,000. That sounds like a lot, but we spend an average of $800 a month on electricity, so that adds up to real money.""\Additionally, Fulp said that Myer Hotels, an Empire customer, was also able to take advantage of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Energy for America Program, which provides grants of up to $20,000 toward solar system costs for businesses in areas classified as rural. The vast majority of southwest Missouri, with the exception of Springfield city limits and parts of the Joplin area, is classified as rural.\West said he believes non-Empire customers are learning of the federal incentives after hearing advertisements running largely because of the Empire rebates.\""The numbers are up everywhere, even outside Empire areas, just through awareness,"" he said.\In a mid-December interview with the News-Leader, West noted the increase in demand, adding that he found it difficult to hire trained installers. He also cautioned, however, that an industry boosted by company and federal incentives can retract as they expire.\""If these rebates go down, and the tax credit goes away, the solar industry may be back to not very much locally ... but we'll see,"" he said.\Days later, however, Congress extended the tax credit set to expire at the end of 2016 for another five years.\""That's huge news for our industry,"" Bartley said. ""Job growth will continue to rise because of this.""\""It's something that I think businesses are slowly waking up to, that there is a business angle to going solar.""\Jason Fulp\Marketing Manager at Missouri Sun Solar\""After the tax benefits, it is possible that the real outlay will be more like $65,000-$70,000.

236,"Neighborhoods and growth issues also important to City Council candidates.\Jenny Fillmer, News-Leader and Amos Bridges, News-Leader\Neighborhoods, energy and growth issues are common themes in two races for citywide seats on the Springfield City Council.\Doug Burlison faces Councilwoman Mary Collette in the upcoming April 5 election. Both hope to win the council's General Seat A, one of four seats that represent the whole city, rather than a particular zone.\The Rev. Gwen Marshall and Councilman Gary Deaver are vying for General Seat B.\Seats C and D are not up for election until 2007.\General Seat A\An incumbent is pitted against a seasoned political candidate in the race for General Seat A.\Collette, a graphic artist and developer of historic property, was elected to the seat in 2001. On the council she is a champion of strong neighborhoods, Center City revitalization, the arts and historic preservation -- causes she worked for before her election.\Burlison, an assistant print manager for a label company, has been running for office, off and on, since 1994. After five campaigns for U.S. representative, Burlison has become a familiar political face, one associated for years with the Libertarian party before a 2004 switch to run as a Democrat.\Both Burlison and Collette favor energy conservation, sensitivity toward the environment, job creation and organizations that empower older neighborhoods.\As with many incumbent-challenger races, differences are found in their level of experience and their plans for following through on ideas for the future of Springfield.\General Seat B\Deaver, the incumbent General B councilman, said he hopes to build on the experience he has gained since first winning the seat in 2003.\Founder and former president of Sparky's Waste Control Inc., he won the seat in a special election after former Councilman Gary Gibson died in office.\""I really thought when I ran two years ago that, 'Boy, I've really got the background to serve my fellow citizens,' said Deaver, a veteran of dozens of local boards and commissions. "" ... But there's just a lot more to the job than meets the eye.""\With another term, Deaver said he would like to continue to encourage economic growth and center-city revitalization and develop additional tools to empower neighborhoods.\Although a political newcomer, Deaver's challenger, Marshall, said she looks forward to ""leading while learning.""\""Even though my experience has not been in elected offices, my experiences have been vast in community services,"" Marshall said. ""Although it's not city government, it is still meeting the needs of people.""\In addition to working with special needs students and as a minister, Marshall is the founder and coordinating director of the Black History Summer Academy, a two-week educational and cultural program for youth and adults in Springfield.\If elected, she would seek collaborative ways to better prepare young people for the future, while managing growth and raising the economic standards of all city residents.\Gwendolyn Marshall\Residence: Springfield resident for 37 years, lives in Midtown.\Age: 56\Work: Education paraprofessional for Springfield Public Schools and member of the ministerial staff at Deliverance Temple Ministries.\Education: Graduates in May with a bachelor's degree in social sciences from Drury University.\Public office: None.\Related experience: Coordinating director for the Black History Summer Academy; board member of the History Museum for Springfield and Greene County; vice president of the Minister's Coalition of Springfield.\Web site: www.gwenmarshall.com\Endorsed by: None at present.\Most important issues:\Developing resources to keep up with growth.\Bringing more industry into the area to boost Springfield's economic base.\Increasing local wages in order to stabilize families and attract and retain professionals.\Vision 20/20: Supports the plan, and advocates continued attention to its implementation.\Growth: Advocates collaboration between city and Greene County, with effort made to preserve culture, quality of life, health and safety.\Downtown: Supporter of downtown redevelopment. ""The history and culture represented by the downtown area are important to keep alive, as the rest of the city expands outward ... As an economic source, it is also important that we continue to develop that area along with the rest of the Jordan Valley project.""\Energy: Look to comparable cities to see what has and has not been successful in conservation and energy production. ""Our approach must be one of open-mindedness and a willingness to learn.""\Economic development: Encourage expansion and new businesses through zoning incentives while promoting entrepreneurship among young people.\Why are you the best choice?

In undeveloped areas, supports both environmental protection and affordable construction standards.\Downtown: Supports downtown redevelopment, but is wary of any public project requiring use of eminent domain to acquire property.\Energy: Supports net metering, which allows utility customers to sell excess energy created alternative power, like solar and wind, back to the utility. City Utilities adopted the state-required plan in 2002, and would reimbursing customers at the rate of savings from avoided energy production. Burlison supports a retail reimbursement rate. No CU customers currently generate enough energy to sell.\Economic development: Would push for a 50-percent abatement on sales taxes charged on products sold by new retailers, during their first few years of business. Burlison believes funds lost on sales tax revenue would be more than compensated by new job creation. Sales tax is currently the city's largest source of revenue, approximately $61 million, or 32 percent of the city's annual operating budget.\Why are you the best choice?\""I'm very capable of thinking outside of the box, because of my background of being outside the political mainstream.

237,"LOCAL Reporter Sara Shipley: E-mail: sshipley@post-dispatch.com Phone: 314-340-8215\ Eight national and regional environmental groups registered their opposition Friday to the proposed Holcim cement plant in Ste. Genevieve County.\ The environmental groups wrote a letter asking the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to do everything they can to halt the $600 million project, which involves building the nation's largest cement plant along the Mississippi River.\ ""It is a very big deal when so many national environmental groups have their attention drawn by this kind of issue,"" said Ted Heisel, senior law and policy coordinator for the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, a St. Louis-based group that opposes the plant.\ The letter asks the two federal agencies to weigh in through the Army Co rps of Engineers' wetlands permit process. Once the corps issues the permit - which could happen by the end of the year - the agencies can request formal review by their top officials. The EPA also can veto a wetlands permit.\ Mike Mullin, director of government affairs and communication for the project with Holcim (US) Inc., said the letter was disappointing.\ ""This project has been studied extensively and revised with the end goal of minimal environmental impacts, while bringing 1,000 construction jobs to the state and 200 long-term jobs,"" he said.\ Groups signing the letter include American Rivers, Environmental Defense, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club. Their concerns include wetlands destruction and pollution of air and water.\ EPA officials were not available for comment Friday. Rick Hansen, a federal Fish and Wildlife Service biologist in Columbia, Mo., said his agency was opposed to the project as currently proposed."
