0,"By Commentary by Phil Valentine\While everyone is focused on the health-care bill coming out of Congress, there's a huge cap-and-trade freight train barreling down the tracks. It's starting to pick up even more steam as it prepares to emerge from the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and up ahead, straddling the tracks, is the U.S. economy. If this train isn't stopped in time it will do irreparable damage.\Valero Energy Corp., which operates a refinery in Delaware City, Del., says it will see annual production cost increases between $40 million and $80 million at that one refinery if the cap-and-trade bill passes. Imagine what that will mean to the price of gasoline, that is if Valero can manage to stay in business. They worry that foreign competitors, not bound by the enormous constraints of the bill, will put them out of business.\The House version, the Waxman-Markey bill, which is looking more and more like the Wacky-Marxist bill, would increase electricity rates significantly. An Energy Information Administration study found that the average household would be paying nearly $2,000 more per year in energy costs. And for what? To reduce the emission of a harmless gas called carbon dioxide.\Contrary to what the dirt people tell you, CO2 is not a pollutant. It's what we exhale with every breath. It's what plants depend on to grow. In fact, scientific research is now telling us that higher concentrations of CO2 mean faster and greener plant growth.\If this bill were actually attacking real pollution, then it might make sense. Nobody supports more smog, but CO2 is not in smog. Smog is made up of nasty things like ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. CO2 is not the problem!\Smokestack technology has advanced over the last several decades to the point that most of the dangerous gases are removed. The catalytic converter on your automobile was designed to turn most of the harmful carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide.\So, why the big push to demonize CO2? Because it has become the last way for the radical environmentalists to control industry and redistribute its wealth. Were they to somehow develop a way to turn CO2 into oxygen these same people would label oxygen a pollutant, too.\It's ridiculous to even entertain the notion that something we exhale and plants use in photosynthesis is somehow a pollutant, but that's just how desperate these people have become.\That desperation was on full display recently at a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee meeting on global warming. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., attributed, of all things, the pine beetle destroying forestland to global warming. He then said, ""We have columns of methane rising now in the ocean,"" as if that were somehow related to anthropogenic global warming.\It's also nothing new. Scientists now acknowledge that methane has been released from hydrate beneath the sea floor since the end of the last ice age. In Kerry's 26 1/2-minute diatribe before the committee he uttered this unbelievable claim: ""We invented wind."" Maybe he's been hanging out with Al Gore a little too much.\Once again, Kerry announced that the science was settled. Sen. Lamar Alexander has apparently sipped some of the Kool-Aid, too, announcing, ""Eleven academies in industrialized countries say that climate change is real; humans have caused most of the recent warming."" Sen. Alexander chooses to ignore over 30,000 scientists -- 9,000 of them with Ph.Ds -- who have signed a petition refuting manmade global warming. There may be a lot of bloviating going on, but there's anything but a consensus.\We now know that global temperatures have remained steady for the last decade while CO2 levels are up 4 percent. Kerry and his crowd choose to ignore that little inconvenient truth and trod forward with a plan that will put the United States at a considerable economic disadvantage with the rest of the world.\This dangerous piece of legislation seems destined for President Barack Obama's desk for a signature. If that happens, it will not only wreck our economy, it'll be a gross injustice to the truth.\Phil Valentine is an author and syndicated radio talk-show host heard locally on SuperTalk 99.7 WTN weekdays 4-8 p.m. His column appears in The Tennessean on Sundays.

1,"Global warming has become a buzzword, inciting passionate responses from all ends of the political and environmental spectrums.\The focus has largely been on the science behind climate change, and as debate over this issue continues, I worry many will be caught up in the aura surrounding global warming and pay little attention to the actual policy that will impact Americans, driving up gas prices and electricity bills.\My interest isn't to debate the science. Since no one can quantify how much of global warming is caused by natural cycles vs. man-made greenhouse emissions, I have focused on digging into the policy the Senate could debate as early as June and am working to ensure any emerging policy will be sound and enable us to increase our energy and economic security while being good environmental stewards.\There are many complexities in legislation of this magnitude, so I have visited Europe with Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman, D-N,M., to meet carbon traders, gone to Greenland with Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to view the effects of climate change, and spent countless hours with Tennessee-based industry, conservation groups and experts discussing climate change legislation.\A market-based approach\The likely vehicle for this debate is America's Climate Security Act sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and John Warner, R-Va., which implements a ""cap-and-trade"" program. This program would cap and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, refineries and factories using a market-based system intended to make reductions as cost-effective as possible. In short, the federal government would issue credits, allowing industries to emit a limited amount of greenhouse emissions yearly. Some of these credits would be freely allocated to facilities that must reduce emissions, while others would be sold to the highest bidder through an auction.\Additional credits would be freely allocated to entities, such as states, that don't have to reduce emissions but are able to sell those credits and use that money to assist consumers through rebates or public programs. Each credit would be an asset, and therefore giving away those credits not sold through an auction would cause a real transference of wealth.\One of my major concerns with the bill is that it's not simply a cap-and-trade program; it's a massive spending bill. In essence, it taxes energy producers and manufacturers by putting a price on emissions and creating a market for credits -- resulting in higher prices for consumers.\The bill then takes revenue generated from selling these credits, bypasses the annual appropriations process, and automatically spends those trillions of dollars on new and existing government programs. I think it makes more sense to return the money directly to citizens affected by the costs associated with implementing this program.\It's possible I may support cap-and-trade legislation, and I want to have a constructive debate. However, I think it's inappropriate for me to support legislation that increases costs to consumers then automatically spends trillions of dollars on various programs that could instead be returned to the American people.\Republican Bob Corker represents Tennessee in the U.S. Senate and is a member of the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee."
2,"The climate-change accord President Barack Obama brought back from Copenhagen two weeks ago rests on thin ice, indeed. Yet, in the new year, the president will don his skates in an attempt to turn this tenuous deal into congressional gold.\This has not been a good year for the forces trying to rein in the pollution that is contributing to global warming and thus to potentially catastrophic flooding, crop failures and other problems in the coming decades. Not only has China shirked responsibility for being one of the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases, but the United States -- we're No. 1 -- continues to resist confronting its own carbon output.\Skepticism toward man-made global warming has remained stubbornly high in this country and even grown in some polls, though more objective surveys, such as a recent Associated Press/Stanford University poll, indicate that three-fourths of Americans still view climate change as a serious threat.\The politicization of the issue is such that Republicans who believe global warming exists risk being shunned by their party, and Democrats want to leave Republicans out of the conversation altogether, which would be a big mistake.\All Americans want clean air, water and land. At the human level, our needs are the same, which is what makes the division over how to clean up the environment so dangerous.\The president soon will push for a ""cap and trade"" bill in the Senate, whereby polluting industries could trade permits to satisfy overall limits on CO2 emissions. Opponents paint cap and trade as anti-business when, in reality, it is very business-friendly.\Businesses can continue to pollute under cap and trade, as long as they pay for permits auctioned by cleaner industries. That has riled hard-line environmentalists, who would prefer that the Environmental Protection Agency force polluters to clean up or be shut down. But Obama and other cap-and-trade proponents argue that over time, the cost of buying permits will compel polluters to cut emissions.\As with other policies of this middle-of-the-road president, extreme voices on both sides are taking shots at cap and trade. It is, however, the only serious proposal on the table. Conservatives want voluntary limits that have been in place, and largely ineffective, for decades. The EPA will step in if cap and trade is defeated, but it would be an ugly business, with some industries spending millions of dollars to fight federal orders in court.\Cap and trade could bring all sides together for a common goal. Still, it would have a smoother path to approval if President Obama had more to show for Copenhagen. A promise by China, India, Brazil and South Africa to set voluntary climate targets is no better than what backers of the status quo in the United States propose. For them, it is all about stalling so that someone else has to deal with the consequences.\But it is too late for that. We already are dealing with the consequences, or will be in the next few years. The collapse of animal species and problems with melting ice in commercial and strategic shipping lanes has begun -- and it is not all because of a natural warming cycle, as Harvard and Princeton scientists recently noted.\With a weakened hand, Obama and Democratic lawmakers may have to make added concessions in the cap-and-trade bill, narrowing the scope of the initial legislation or making exceptions for nuclear and other industries. But so be it, if it will get our nation started on a concerted effort to defuse a ticking time bomb."

I am really encouraged by President Barack Obama's commitment to clean energy and combating climate change. I just have three worries: Whether he has the right policies, the right politics and the right official to sell his program. Other than that, things look great!
\
Last week, House Democrats, with administration support, introduced a 600-page draft bill on energy and climate. The center of it is a plan to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions through a complicated cap-and-trade system. These people have the very best of intentions, but I wish they would step back and ask again: Can cap-and-trade pass? Will it really work? And is it the best strategy, with all the bureaucracy it will require to monitor, auction emissions permits and manage the trading?
\
Advocates of cap-and-trade argue that it is preferable to a simple carbon tax because it fixes a national cap on carbon emissions and it ""hides the ball"" -- it doesn't use the word ""tax"" -- even though it amounts to one. So it can get through Congress. That was true as long as no one thought cap-and-trade could ever pass, but now that it might under Obama, opponents are not playing hide the ball anymore. In the past two weeks, you could hear a chorus of Republicans, coal-state Democrats, right-wing think tanks and enviro-skeptics all singing the same tune: ""Cap-and-trade is a tax. Obama is going to raise your taxes and sacrifice U.S. jobs to combat this global-warming charade, which many scientists think is nonsense. Worse, cap-and-trade will be managed by Wall Street. If you liked credit-default swaps, you're going to love carbon-offset swaps.""
\
Some of the refrains from this song have a very catchy appeal. They could easily kill this effort. So, if the Obama team cares about the ""ends"" of a stronger America and a more livable planet, as much as the ""means,"" I hope it will consider an alternative strategy, message and messenger.
\
Strategy: Since the opponents of cap-and-trade are going to pillory it as a tax anyway, why not go for the real thing -- a simple, transparent, economy-wide carbon tax?
\
Rep. John B. Larson, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, has circulated a draft bill that would impose ""a per-unit tax on the carbon-dioxide content of fossil fuels, beginning at a rate of $15 per metric ton of CO2 and increasing by $10 each year."" The bill sets a goal, rather than a cap, on emissions at 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050, and if the goal for the first five years is not met, the tax automatically increases by an additional $5 per metric ton. The bill implements a fee on carbon-intensive imports, as well, to press China to follow suit. Larson would use most of the income to reduce people's payroll taxes: We tax your carbon sins and un-tax your payroll wins.
\
People get that -- and simplicity matters. Americans will be willing to pay a tax for their children to be less threatened, breathe cleaner air and live in a more sustainable world with a stronger America. They are much less likely to support a firm in London trading offsets from an electric bill in Boston with a derivatives firm in New York in order to help fund an aluminum smelter in Beijing, which is what cap-and-trade is all about. People won't support what they can't explain.
\
Message: Climate change is a real threat to a healthy planet Earth -- the only home we have. But because the worst effects are in the future, many Americans have more immediate concerns. That is why our energy policy should be focused around ""American renewal,"" not mitigating climate change. We need a price on carbon because it will stimulate massive innovation in the next great global industry -- ET -- energy technology. In a warming world with huge population growth, clean power systems are going to be in huge demand. The scientific research and innovation needed for America to dominate ET the way it did IT could be the foundation for a second American industrial revolution, plus it would tip the whole planet onto a greener path. So American economic renewal is the goal, but mitigating climate change would be the great byproduct.
\
Messenger: The administration's carbon tax spokesman -- the one who should sell this to the country -- should be the president's national security adviser, Gen. James Jones, not the environmentalists. The imposing former head of the Marine Corps could make a powerful case that a carbon tax is vitally necessary to stimulate investments in the clean technologies that would enable the U.S. to dominate ET, while also shifting consumers to buy these new, more efficient and cleaner power systems, homes and cars.
\
He could make the case that the country with the most powerful clean-technology industry in the 21st century will have the most energy security, national security, economic security, healthy environment, innovative companies and global respect. That country must be America. So let's stop hiding the ball and have a strategy, message and messenger that tell it like it is -- and make it so.

M aybe you've heard of the ""cap-and-trade"" legislation being proposed in Congress. It's being promoted as a way to ""improve the environment"" by making companies that have undesirable emissions pay a price to buy emissions rights from those who pollute less. But in the end, ""cap and trade"" would mean a big new tax and higher prices on all of us Americans.
\
Chattanooga's Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., has warned:
\
""Saddling the American people with a national energy tax when many are already struggling to pay their electricity bills is the wrong approach to solving our nation's energy challenge.
\
""The proposed 'Cap and Tax' bill would make our nation less competitive, cause electricity rates to 'skyrocket' and could cost a lot of people their jobs.
\
""This is a regressive penalty that hurts those on a fixed income the most.
\
""We can meet the country's growing demand for energy and be responsible stewards of the environment through technology and innovation, without a sweeping tax and regulatory scheme.
\
""If we are going to seriously address these challenges, we need to renew our commitment to an all-of-the-above energy strategy that includes nuclear energy and advances conservation and alternative energy initiatives.""
\
He's right.
\
The biggest offender putting obnoxious emissions into the air is Communist China. Capping Americans and letting Communist China (and India) pollute would handicap all Americans economically and yet provide no solution.
\
Much better than U.S. ""cap and trade"" would be increasing U.S. energy production by building more non-polluting nuclear energy-generating sources, such as our local Sequoyah Nuclear Plant.
\
The Wall Street Journal has hit the nail on the head by saying editorially: ""Cap and trade, in other words, is a scheme to redistribute income and wealth -- but in a very curious way. It takes from the working class and gives to the affluent; takes from Miami, Ohio, and gives to Miami, Florida; and takes from an industrial America that is already struggling and gives to rich Silicon Valley and Wall Street 'green tech' investors who know how to leverage the political class.""
\
Most of us want lower taxes, lower energy costs -- and reduction in objectionable emissions. There are reasonable ways to seek all of those desirable things -- but undesirable ""cap and trade"" is not one of them.

It didn't get much attention in all the hoopla surrounding ""Earth Day,"" but a new study shows improvement in the United States' and the world's environmental condition over the past year. The Index of Leading Environmental Indicators, by the nonprofit Pacific Research Institute and the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute, highlights many areas of progress. Here are a few of those areas, which contradict environmental alarmists' claims:
\
* Tropical rain forests may be expanding faster than they are being cut down. A recent New York Times article noted that new forests ""are emerging in Latin America, Asia and other tropical regions at such a fast pace that the trend has set off a serious debate about whether saving primeval rain forest ... may be less urgent than once thought. By one estimate, for every acre of rain forest cut down each year, more than 50 acres of new forest are growing in the tropics on land that was once farmed, logged or ravaged by natural disaster.""
\
* Where there are severe environmental problems, they are usually linked to poverty in developing nations, not to pollution in advanced nations. Not one U.S. or Western European city is among the 50 world cities that have the worst air pollution, according to the World Bank. And air pollution is dropping -- often by stunning percentages and without economy-destroying ""cap-and-trade"" environmental rules -- in the most polluted U.S. cities.
\
* A sampling of drinking water taken from surface waters in nearly 20 areas of the United States found little or no sign of 258 manmade chemicals.
\
* Average global temperatures in 2008 remained steady or dropped. In fact, ""there has been no discernible warming for the last decade.""
\
As liberals in Congress feverishly push costly environmental schemes, the American public seems to be realizing that predictions of catastrophe are fishy. Nearly 60 percent of Americans surveyed recently declined to label themselves environmentalists, whereas almost 80 percent called themselves environmentalists in 1991. More Americans think climate change is a natural occurrence than think it is caused by man, a Rasmussen poll reported. And a Pew survey in early 2008 showed that Americans rank climate change last among 20 issues they believe the country should address.
\
It's not politically correct to say it, but our environment simply is not the disaster that some activists say it is.

Republicans may have a chance to retake control of Congress if the party faithful can get riled up enough to usher them in, former U.S. Rep. Van Hilleary, R-Tenn., said Monday.
\
""We have a great opportunity to come roaring back if we stick to our guns,"" the Spring City, Tenn., native told the Hamilton County Pachyderm Club.
\
Mr. Hilleary, one of 54 Republicans first elected to the U.S. House in 1994, said the GOP lost control of Congress in 2006 because GOP lawmakers started holding more fundraisers in Washington than in their home states.
\
""People in Washington don't tend to give (funds) to you for God and country; it's because they tend to want something back for it,"" he said. ""We Republicans created the environment that allowed someone like Barack Obama to be elected president of this country.""
\
Mr. Hilleary said Republicans should ""get up on the rooftops"" and protest Mr. Obama's health care and cap-and-trade plans, among other initiatives.
\
Rhodes Cook, a political analyst for the University of Virginia's Crystal Ball blog, said the political tide likely will turn based on President Obama's popularity. Democratic Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton all saw their approval ratings dip below 50 percent just before midterm elections in which the GOP made big gains, he said.
\
""(President Obama) has shown a political nimbleness capable of preventing the sharp decline in popularity that befell his Democratic predecessors,"" Mr. Cook wrote in a blog post.
\
Likewise, he said that national Republican leadership is ""much more problematic"" now than in previous elections.
\
Mr. Hilleary agreed the GOP is somewhat lacking in leadership. He said Republicans ought to respond by being more vocal in their opposition to President Obama's plans.
\
In Tennessee's 3rd District U.S. House race, Mr. Hilleary is not taking a side, he said. He said he supports Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, R-Blountville, in the gubernatorial race.

7,"A comprehensive energy policy for the state of Tennessee is much needed and long overdue, but at least the wheels (probably gasoline-powered) have begun to turn.\Gov. Phil Bredesen in March signed an executive order establishing the Governor's Task Force on Energy Policy. The panel, composed of four state commissioners and a dozen others, including legislators and business and environmental figures, has held two meetings so far on their four stated goals:\1. Energy efficiency in state government, especially in building construction and vehicle fleets.\2. Legislation, regulations or incentives to encourage efficiency and conservation in the public and private sectors.\3. Public-private partnerships to encourage research and development of clean-energy technology.\4. Expanding use of alternative fuels and renewable energy sources to sustain a clean environment.\That agenda reaches high and low. Certainly, the first goal is the most easily achievable, and Tennesseans must be scratching their heads at the fact that the state's vehicle fleets weren't overhauled for efficiency years ago. Such shortcomings are the reason that Tennessee is ranked 43rd in energy efficiency by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.\The other three goals, however, are pretty ambitious, and cannot be accomplished quickly. Perhaps, the task force can look to the work already done by other states in the region, including Georgia, Kentucky, Florida and North Carolina, which have had energy plans in place since 2006.\In Florida, for example, Gov. Charlie Crist is backing ""cap-and-trade"" legislation that would direct the state to limit carbon dioxide emissions by power plants and require companies to pay whenever they exceed the restrictions on greenhouse gases.\A national cap-and-trade plan is facing an uphill battle in Congress, but regional initiatives are progressing in the Northeast, West and Midwest. Florida's proposal, if approved, would be the first such program in the South. But given the recent poor air-quality reports for Tennessee's largest cities, it's certainly a prospect Bredesen's panel should consider.\Granted, our state has its work cut out. Where leadership on energy use should have been obvious, it has been lacking. The Knoxville-based Tennessee Valley Authority, after being a pioneer in conservation in the 1970s under the guidance of S. David Freeman, reversed course and focused all its attention on growth and power production.\For more than a generation, the federally licensed utility has encouraged consumption, and only this year has begun to search cold storage for its environmental conscience. Tennesseans are beginning to see electricity price increases, and face the dilemma of having TVA power continue to be generated by carbon-emitting coal-fired plants or ramping up an unpopular nuclear-power program.\All of this sets the task force's bar that much higher. Establishing public-private partnerships is an area in which the governor has demonstrated skill over the years, but the panel must convince private companies that the state will do its part in developing clean-energy technology and alternative fuels. That will mean a funding commitment in a tight economic period.\Yet, commit, we must. Bredesen has signed legislation to spend $100 million of the nearly $460 million in lottery reserve funds to make Tennessee's K-12 schools more energy-efficient. Some legislators had other ideas for that money, but this is well-spent, because it will be paid back many times over in annual energy savings.\It is not too late for the task force to act, but they should feel a sense of urgency as they look for ways for Tennesseans to lighten their impact on the ever-more-fragile environment."

With world temperatures falling over the past decade, it's not so shocking that environmental activists are ""repackaging"" their message to make it come across as less silly and alarmist. They and their government allies are pulling back from the phrase ""global warming,"" The New York Times reported, out of concern that the term makes them seem like ""shaggy-haired liberals.""
\
But that is just for starters.
\
Somebody accidentally e-mailed news outlets some recommendations on how to promote shaky government policies on the environment. The recommendations, by the environmental marketing firm ecoAmerica, were supposed to have been confined to a briefing for government and environmental leaders, but their unintentional release shows how manipulative the environmental movement is.
\
A few examples:
\
* ""Energy efficiency"" should be dropped in favor of ""saving money for a more prosperous future.""
\
* Referring to ""the air we breathe, the water our children drink"" is preferable to mentioning ""the environment.""
\
* Discussions on reducing carbon dioxide -- which many Americans realize is a naturally occurring gas on which life depends but which environmentalists blame for ""climate change"" -- should instead focus on ""moving away from the dirty fuels of the past.""
\
* The biggest abuse of language, though, is the recommendation that a $650 billion proposed ""cap-and-trade"" tax, meant to curb carbon dioxide emissions, be called ""cap and cash back"" or a ""pollution reduction refund."" Trouble is, that ""cash back"" and those ""refunds"" will go to government, through higher prices that energy companies will be forced to impose on their customers, the American people.
\
And there is this cynical reminder about ecoAmerica's findings, which are based on focus groups: ""(R)emember to speak in TALKING POINTS ... about shared American ideals, like freedom, prosperity, independence and self-sufficiency while avoiding jargon and details about policy, science, economics or technology.""
\
In other words, don't worry about facts.
\
Happily, Americans don't seem to be buying the hype. A new Rasmussen poll finds that barely one-third of Americans believe man is to blame for supposed global warming, and the issue ranked dead last of 20 concerns among voters responding to a Pew Research Center poll in January.
\
We hope the politicians eventually follow where the people are leading.

To the left, the oil spill is not an index of presidential competence or an issue in the political sphere. It is a daily gushing of poison into the Earth's waters as a direct result of the president's failure to stop it. They blame BP. But they already hate oil companies. And they blame Obama, too. And they are coming to dislike him.
\
When Obama attempts to recoup this damage to his political base by pushing new legislation on the environment or by resurrecting his cap-and-trade legislation or by bringing criminal charges against BP or by setting up a liability fund for the spill's victims, it does not solve his political problem. With each day, countless gallons gush into the Gulf of Mexico, Obama's equivalent of the body count in Iraq that caused the left to loathe George W. Bush. Rhetoric or programs or visits to the gulf or posturing won't assuage the negatives. Only plugging the hole in the bottom of the ocean can do it.
\
The right and center of American politics turned off Obama over health care. And now the left is leaving him over the oil spill.
\
Why can't Obama plug the hole?
\
Because he has no administrative experience. I often saw Bill Clinton, as governor and as president, call in experts and ask the tough questions when he faced a new disaster. In Arkansas, it was tornadoes or floods or fires. In Washington, it was Oklahoma City. But, each time, he thoroughly familiarized himself with all the technical issues. He took a bath in the science and substance of the hazard and became as knowledgeable as those who had spent a lifetime studying it. So he knew what questions to ask.
\
Any CEO or manager has similar experience. But a community organizer, law professor, state senator, U.S. senator and president doesn't have the requisite experience. He doesn't know not to trust his own bureaucracy. He hasn't been burned enough to realize that he needs to intervene to waive restrictions, set aside regulations and open up the process to new solutions. He's like JFK during the Bay of Pigs. He doesn't know how to avoid being betrayed by his own bureaucracy and the industry it's supposed to regulate.
\
Why did he not waive the Jones Act (he still hasn't) to allow foreign vessels to ply our waters to clean up the spill? Not because he was against it. He couldn't have been against so obvious a course as waiving it. It was likely because nobody told him about it, and he never knew to ask.
\
Why did he let the bureaucracy use only U.S. contractors to dredge the Gulf and build the berms that Louisiana wanted? Why did he spurn the offer of Dutch assistance (half the country has been dredged from the sea and is below sea level)? Not because he wanted the jobs to go to Americans. That would have been an insane consideration in the face of this crisis. It is probably because he never realized that our capacity for dredging needed augmentation. Because he never asked.
\
To the right and the center, these failings show that Obama is in over his head. But to the left, which bleeds for each drop of water in the Gulf and cries over every turtle or shrimp or sea bird, it is an unpardonable sin.
\
It is the nature of things that presidential mistakes metastasize into presidential character flaws. Bush's inaction over Katrina comes across as insensitivity. Now Obama's incompetence and inexperience are causing liberals to see him as arrogant, aloof, removed, conceited, suspicious of outside advice and even lazy. Long after the oil has stopped spilling, these supposed character defects will haunt the president, just as Jimmy Carter's reputation for timidity and inability lasted long after the Iran hostages came home. These defects will last until 2012 and beyond.

Never say that the gods lack a sense of humor. I bet they're still chuckling on Olympus over the decision to make the first half of 2010 -- the year in which all hope of action to limit climate change died -- the hottest such stretch on record.
\
Of course, you can't infer trends in global temperatures from one year's experience. But ignoring that fact has long been one of the favorite tricks of climate-change deniers: They point to an unusually warm year in the past, and say ""See, the planet has been cooling, not warming, since 1998!"" Actually, 2005, not 1998, was the warmest year to date -- but the point is that the record-breaking temperatures we're currently experiencing have made a nonsense argument even more nonsensical; at this point it doesn't work even on its own terms.
\
But will any of the deniers say ""OK, I guess I was wrong,"" and support climate action? No. And the planet will continue to cook. So why didn't climate-change legislation get through the Senate? Let's talk about what didn't cause the failure, because there have been many attempts to blame the wrong people.
\
First of all, we didn't fail to act because of legitimate doubts about the science. Every piece of valid evidence -- long-term temperature averages that smooth out year-to-year fluctuations, Arctic sea ice volume, melting of glaciers, -- points to a continuing, and quite possibly accelerating, rise in global temperatures.
\
Nor is this evidence tainted by scientific misbehavior. You've probably heard about the accusations leveled against climate researchers -- allegations of fabricated data, the supposedly damning e-mail of ""Climategate,"" and so on. What you may not have heard, because it has received much less publicity, is that every one of these supposed scandals was eventually unmasked as a fraud concocted by opponents of climate action, then bought into by many in the news media. You don't believe such things can happen? Think Shirley Sherrod.
\
Did reasonable concerns about the economic impact of climate legislation block action? No. It has always been funny to watch conservatives who laud the limitless power and flexibility of markets turn around and insist that the economy would collapse if we were to put a price on carbon. All serious estimates suggest that we could phase in limits on greenhouse gas emissions with at most a small impact on the economy.
\
So it wasn't the science, the scientists, or the economics that killed action on climate change. What was it? The answer is, the usual suspects: greed and cowardice.
\
If you want to understand opposition to climate action, follow the money. The economy as a whole wouldn't be significantly hurt if we put a price on carbon, but certain industries -- above all, the coal and oil industries -- would. And those industries have mounted a huge disinformation campaign to protect their bottom lines.
\
Look at the scientists who question the consensus on climate change; look at the organizations pushing fake scandals; look at the think tanks claiming that any effort to limit emissions would cripple the economy. Again and again, you'll find that they're on the receiving end of a pipeline of funding that starts with big energy companies, like Exxon Mobil, which has spent tens of millions of dollars promoting climate-change denial, or Koch Industries, which has been sponsoring anti-environmental organizations for two decades. Or look at the politicians who have been vociferously opposed to climate action. Where do they get much of their campaign money? You know the answer.
\
By itself, however, greed wouldn't have triumphed. It needed the aid of cowardice -- above all, the cowardice of politicians who know how big a threat global warming poses, who supported action in the past, but who deserted their posts at the crucial moment.
\
There are a number of such climate cowards, but let me single out one in particular: Sen. John McCain.
\
There was a time when McCain was considered a friend of the environment. Back in 2003 he burnished his maverick image by co-sponsoring legislation that would have created a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions. He reaffirmed support for such a system during his presidential campaign, and things might look very different now if he had continued to back climate action once his opponent was in the White House. But he didn't -- and it's hard to see his switch as anything other than the act of a man willing to sacrifice his principles, and humanity's future, for the sake of a few years added to his political career.
\
Alas, McCain wasn't alone; and there will be no climate bill. Greed, aided by cowardice, has triumphed. And the whole world will pay the price.

11,"By Anne Paine\THE TENNESSEAN\A hot-air balloon promoting the idea that climate change is a myth didn't get far off the ground Wednesday.\Winds kept the scores of kids and adults who had lined up for rides from floating more than 4 or 5 feet aloft, organizers of the Americans for Prosperity's Hot Air Balloon Tour said.\The group, which questions the science behind global warming concerns, is pressing the public to lobby against legislation in Congress that would set up a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\The buying and selling of pollution allowances would amount to a tax on energy, said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity.\""We think American families need to know what these proposals will cost them -- lost jobs, even higher energy prices and less freedom.""\Activists who disagree have questioned the group's funding and motives. They say cap-and-trade of sulfur dioxide has worked to reduce acid rain.\The event Wednesday at the Tennessee State Fairgrounds drew about 200 people, with conservative talk radio personality Phil Valentine among the speakers.\T-shirts in the crowd sported slogans that included ""Dumb Masses"" and ""The Truth is Cool."" Several of the same people who showed up for the April anti-tax ""Tea Party"" rally at the state Capitol attended.\One of those, Murray Frazier, a sales representative from Old Hickory, had a red Americans for Prosperity T-shirt wrapped around his head to shield him from the sun. His 4-year-old son, Max, waited eagerly to go up in the balloon.\""I think we need to do everything we can to protect the environment, but I don't see any real evidence of man-caused global warming,"" Frazier said.\Many others there had a similar view.\""It's a crock,"" said Dan Cleary of Spring Hill, there with his wife, Stephanie, and their four young children.\""We definitely don't buy into that,"" she said.\Sheets with detachable postcards to send lawmakers said the proposal would amount to a\$1.9 trillion tax hike over 10 years. Gas would go over $8 a gallon, electricity prices would double, and millions of jobs would be lost in this country.\Bill Nolan, speaking for The Natural Resources Defense Council, called the group a ""phony grass-roots organization and front group for a powerful energy company with a terrible environmental record, Koch Industries.""\""They are throwing around a lot of scary numbers and misleading statements in an effort to convince people that climate and energy incentives will somehow hurt our economy,"" Nolan said.\A recent study shows that climate and energy legislation would create millions of jobs as well as reduce carbon dioxide emissions, he added.\Phillips said in response to Nolan's criticism that the group works on a much wider range of free-market issues than energy. It stumps to stop government involvement in health care, for one. And money comes from a variety of sources that include 22,000 donors, he said.\The tour is moving from town to town. It arrived in Nashville from St. Louis, setting up the balloon, filling it with hot air, then collapsing it to move on to Little Rock, Ark.\Normally, people get to go 100 or more feet in the air, but that couldn't be risked in the breeze Wednesday, even at 15 mph, Phillips said.\A similar Hot Air Balloon Tour took place last year, with the group flying the balloon near the Belle Meade home of former Vice President and Nobel laureate Al Gore, a longtime leader of efforts to curb emissions.\The group had said Gore is full of hot air.\Senators get calls\Phillips called on everyone present Wednesday to take their cell phones and call one of Tennessee's two Republican senators, Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker, to tell them to vote against climate-change legislation.\After being given the phone numbers, people put a thumb in the air when they reached the offices.\At least one man didn't take part, saying he was looking more deeply into the issue.\""I'm still learning,"" said Allen Horton, a retirement adviser from Brentwood.\He had brought his sons, Isaiah, 5, and Andrew, 11, for a ride, but they seemed less than thrilled after getting out of the balloon's basket.\How was it?\""Hot,"" Isaiah said, shrugging."
12,"As the United States charts a course for dealing with the threat of climate change, there are not a lot of models to follow.\The man-made impact on the global environment has no precedent, which has given ammunition to naysayers at the same time as it complicates matters for those who constructively want to prepare us for the challenges of global warming.\The single most daunting task will be to stop the growth of greenhouse gases. Immediate, deep cuts in industry and motor vehicle emissions have so far proved impractical, since their production also provides the food, clothing and medicines we need.\But a program that began in Britain in 2002 and across the European Union in 2005 may hold the answer. The carbon-trading market, better known as a cap-and-trade system, works like a commodities market, except that the commodity is tons of carbon dioxide, the source of greenhouse gases.\EU countries agree to carbon reduction targets, and are issued permits for an amount of allowable carbon emissions. Those permits are passed on to businesses, which can either continue to pollute but be required to buy more carbon units on the open market, or retrofit their plants to reduce emissions and sell their permits for a profit.\Over time, having to purchase units becomes more costly to the company than taking steps to cut emissions. And since the units are sold at market prices, the system generates funds that can be spent on research and development of clean technology.\The system has worked well enough that Congress is looking at an American counterpart. America's Climate Security Act (S.2191), sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and John Warner, R-Va., would use a cap-and-trade system to cut greenhouse gases 19 percent by 2025 and 70 percent by 2050. The carbon-unit auctions could generate trillions of dollars over decades.\While the measure has bipartisan Senate support, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and others are waving a red flag. Corker says committing all funds generated to new and existing government programs amounts to entitlement spending, and that the proceeds should instead be given to citizens to offset the higher costs of fuel and other goods that retrofitting industries will charge consumers.\There are also worries over the proposed creation of new federal agencies, such as a carbon-market efficiency board, to handle the trading system.\Corker has some valid concerns, as the money allocated to certain areas, such as wildlife adaptation, seems excessive. But the Lieberman-Warner plan on the whole appears sound, and it would be a mistake to funnel all the proceeds to the public when there is still such a need for research into clean technologies. Cap and trade does not eliminate pollution altogether, and it makes sense to fund research into large-scale alternatives to fossil fuels.\Either way, the proposal is infinitely better than that offered by President Bush last week. The president, for the first time in his 7A 1/2 years in office, set a target for climate pollution reductions - but with no proposals for how to achieve reductions, and no mechanism to compel companies to change.\Environmental experts who analyzed Bush's toothless initiative said it would allow continued growth of greenhouse gases for nearly two decades. Clearly, America cannot afford to let that happen.\Fortunately, all three of the leading candidates in November endorse some form of cap-and-trade legislation. Serious action must be taken soon, but Lieberman-Warner may not withstand a Bush veto. Congress should nevertheless hammer out the best cap-and-trade system it can, and be ready for America's new morning in January 2009."
13,"TENNESSEAN WASHINGTON BUREAU\WASHINGTON -- The potential impact of climate change legislation on consumers and businesses has sparked concerns in states like Tennessee that get a lot of their electricity from coal.\The legislation will move to the top of the legislative agenda when Congress gets back to work on April 20. The House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold hearings that week on draft legislation released just before Congress's Easter break by committee chairman Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. He hopes to have a bill out of committee by Memorial Day, Greg Dotson, a legislative aide to Waxman, said at an energy conference in Washington last week.\Tennessee members of Congress, including energy committee members Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Brentwood, and Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Murfreesboro, are expected to play an important role in the debate on that proposal and later in the year when the issue is debated in the Senate.\The most contentious part of the proposal by Waxman and Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., is a cap-and-trade plan to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that many scientists believe are behind rising temperatures and could cause an environmental disaster.\The plan would cap total emissions, mostly carbon dioxide, with the goal of cutting them to 20 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. Plants that are unable to meet emission limits could buy pollution allowances from emitters that can.\At its core, the plan would drive up the price of carbon fuels as a way to force changes in personal behavior and business practices.\Coal is central to the debate because generating electricity using coal created about 28 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2007, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\Tennessee gets about 65 percent of its electricity from coal, meaning the state could suffer greater financial consequences from a strategy that essentially would drive up the cost of emitting greenhouse gases.\Questions still to be answered are whether the federal government should auction off all the emissions allowances or give some away to mitigate the economic impact, and what would happen to the billions raised by an auction.\""It's a new tax that would be imposed on business and industry at a time when they are trying to sustain jobs,"" said Wayne Scharber, vice president for environmental affairs at the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\Republican Sen. Bob Corker, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said he hasn't seen a proposal so far that he could support.\He favors selling all of the allowances and returning 100 percent of the proceeds to taxpayers.\""One of my greatest goals in this debate is to make sure not a penny of that goes into the federal treasury,"" said Corker, who like last year will be a key player in the debate.\Timing is a concern\Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate, has proposed cap-and-trade bills throughout his Senate career but is worried about the timing.\""The way to deal with a recession is not more taxes,"" said Alexander, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, where Senate climate legislation will begin.\Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Nashville, has introduced legislation that would ease the transition to cap-and-trade by establishing an independent commission to set the price of allowances and decide how they should be\doled out.\He believes the state's coal dependency could be turned to its advantage. Tennessee ""may have more potential for green jobs in transitioning to a lower-emitting fuel,"" Cooper said.\Joe Hoagland, vice president of environmental science for the Tennessee Valley Authority, said the government utility is getting ahead of the curve by increasing the portion of its electricity produced with no or low greenhouse gas emissions.\Last year, the TVA board set a goal of 50 percent generation by clean energy by 2020. TVA now generates 60 percent of its power using coal.\Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said the price of energy needs to go up to force changes.\""We've enjoyed artificially low rates over the years. That has been irresponsible,"" Smith said. ""It's time we step up and do our fair share to solve this national and international problem.""\Contact Bill Theobald at wtheobal@gannett.com."

We are fortunate that our Constitution delegates limited powers to the federal government and leaves the rest to the states and the people. One advantage of that system is that states may replicate policies that are successful in other states and avoid those policies that fail.
\
But the federal government seems determined to force all states to copy California's harmful anti-global-warming efforts.
\
California is tens of billions of dollars in the red, with no clear prospect for improvement.
\
There are many reasons for that, including big spending and high taxes. But another key reason is California's imposition of devastating environmental regulations. Those regulations have driven industry away.
\
In the late 1980s, California had eight factories building cars. It has only one today, Max Schulz, director of the Center for Energy Policy and the Environment at the Manhattan Institute think tank, pointed out. Other industries have followed suit.
\
Why?
\
In large part because of anti-global-warming rules, much of California's energy has to come from costly, heavily subsidized alternative sources such as solar and wind power. Ironically, as much as a fifth of California's energy is coming from coal-fired plants in nearby states, since that kind of energy can't be produced inside California. And California suffers from periodic ""brownouts"" and has vastly higher energy costs than most other states.
\
Yet instead of fleeing that bad example, Congress is embracing it. The ""cap-and-trade"" (or ""cap-and-tax"") bill passed by the House of Representatives has ""California's fingerprints ... all over it,"" one environmental activist told the San Francisco Chronicle. In fact, the bill in Congress ""copies whole chapters from California's global warming playbook,"" the newspaper reported.
\
That includes harsh, costly limits on carbon emissions and the burning of coal -- without any cost-effective alternative that will keep our nation's lights on.
\
Those regulations have helped bankrupt California. Is that a model worth imitating?

15,"By Chas Sisk\THE TENNESSEAN\As the state tries to reap the benefits of a growing solar industry that could bring thousands of new jobs and billions in new investment, the massive projects also bring with them environmental challenges in the form of intensive manufacturing operations that will draw a tremendous amount of electricity from the state's power grid used to run sprawling chemical reactors.\With just two investments -- Hemlock Semiconductor Group near Clarksville and a similar Wacker Chemie AG plant near Chattanooga -- Tennessee is poised to become a nationwide leader in the production of polysilicon crystals, the basic building block for the solar industry. Together, these plants will cost at least $2.2 billion to construct.\Meanwhile, the state also is pitching a third site in West Tennessee for solar, and it is putting together plans to build a $35 million ""solar institute"" at Oak Ridge National Laboratory that will research the industry.\At least at the outset, these solar companies' demand for electricity may actually increase the state's dependency on polluting, coal-fired power plants operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.\The plants also raise possible environmental and safety hazards, as potentially dangerous chlorine-based gases and liquids are heated to temperatures exceeding 3,600 degrees, then stored and recycled.\Many officials have been quick to describe these plants as ""green,"" based on the fact that the materials they produce will eventually be used to make solar panels that can curb the nation's dependence on coal and natural gas.\But the state's budding solar sector also is an outgrowth of its established chemicals industry. The companies themselves cite access to cheap and reliable power and proximity to chlorine suppliers as main reasons for putting their plants in Tennessee.\Keeping these plants safe and economically viable will require strict enforcement of state and federal laws, scientists and environmentalists say.\The state itself also bears a financial risk. Besides extending $100 million or more in direct subsidies and infrastructure improvements, the state has promised to cover the cost of any carbon offsets that the plants may need, if the U.S. Congress passes a cap-and-trade plan to combat global warming.\""I think the reason we got the plants was Tennessee promised them we'd hold them harmless from whatever federal environmental regulation there would be,"" U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper said in an interview soon after the investments were announced. ""We need to be getting a handle on that.""\Supporters acknowledge those challenges but are quick to say the costs are worthwhile. With very little solar panel production in the United States right now, the state is poised to get in on the ground floor of an industry with nearly boundless potential, they say.\""The governor talks about these plants as being the anchors around which we're going to develop a whole industry,"" said Matt Kisber, the state's commissioner for economic and community development. ""Landing Hemlock and Wacker together is a transformational opportunity for Tennessee.""\Strategy was departure\Tennessee's bid to become the center of the solar industry started not quite two years ago, when Gov. Phil Bredesen asked Kisber and Reagan Farr, the state's revenue commissioner, to come up with a strategy to promote the green energy sector. The strategy represented a departure for the state, which for more than two decades has focused its efforts on heavy manufacturing, particularly the automobile industry.\Tennessee, however, had some assets it could use to its advantage. A central location makes it convenient to other markets, and a system of subsidies and tax credits for job training and infrastructure improvements meant companies could build a plant and reap a profit more quickly.\The state also had a portfolio of large industrial sites near railroads, highways and high-tension power lines operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.\It's that last element that is perhaps the most important for the solar industry. The raw material used in solar panel production is polysilicon, a purified form of silicon that is cut into thin wafers and covered with glass. Polysilicon is made from quartzite, one of the most common rocks on the planet, but making it requires heating the quartzite to more than 3,600 degrees in a massive electric arc furnace, then refining it for more than a week.\Another asset has been Tennessee's well-developed chemicals industry. Breaking quartzite down into pure silicon means exposing it to some kind of catalyst. Usually this is a chlorine-based chemical, such as hydrochloric acid.\In announcing its investment in February, Germany-based Wacker said that the East Tennessee presence of its chlorine supplier, Olin Corp., helped clinch its decision to locate its $1 billion polysilicon plant in Bradley County, 30 miles northeast of Chattanooga.\The two Tennessee plants will be among the first in the nation dedicated solely to producing polysilicon for the solar industry.\The market for polysilicon is uncertain, and prices have fluctuated wildly, along with other energy prices during the recession. But demand for polysilicon is expected to grow, as states and the federal government take steps to encourage the instillation of solar panels, said Cai Steger, an economist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.\Solar has quick payoff\Environmental groups, such as the NRDC, have embraced solar enthusiastically. Besides being renewable, solar panels have a quick payoff. Studies show that within two to four years a solar panel turns out more power than was used to create it, and the greenhouse gas emissions from production of a solar panel are 80 percent to 90 percent less than those turned out by a coal plant.\But no solar power will be used to produce polysilicon in Tennessee, at least initially. Neither Hemlock nor Wacker has committed to purchase power from green energy sources. Instead, they will buy electricity from TVA, which generates most of its power from coal, dams and nuclear plants.\The state's third potential solar site, in Haywood County in West Tennessee, could feature a solar array. To encourage development there, officials in the Bredesen administration have asked the federal government to approve roughly $30 million in stimulus funding for construction of a solar array. That request is still under review.\The source of Hemlock and Wacker's power is not just an environmental matter. It also could have an impact on the state budget.\A state law passed last year says that Tennessee will pay for any carbon-emission taxes placed on solar plants like the Hemlock and Wacker facilities through a federal cap-and-trade system. The law places no limit on how much the state will pay out.\State officials say the law was needed to persuade Hemlock and Wacker not to locate outside the United States, where there is not a threat of a carbon tax. They say they plan to lobby Congress to carve out an exception for plants that make solar and green energy generation equipment.\""Governor Bredesen is a budget-minded guy ... so I'm confident he's looked at that,"" Cooper said in an interview last week. ""It's important to keep in mind that Congress hasn't approved the carbon tax, so that part of the increase may not apply.""\Safety records are good\A second challenge is handling the chemicals needed to make polysilicon.\Generally, the polysilicon industry's environmental and safety record has been good, said Seth Kaplan, the head of the climate advocacy group at the Conservation Law Foundation in Boston. Although polysilicon production for the solar industry is relatively new, the material has been produced in large quantities for the semiconductor sector for decades, with few incidents.\But that may be the result of tight regulation, Kaplan said.\""You are potentially dealing with stuff that you've got to do right,"" he said. ""And for whatever reason, silicon production previously has tended to be located in places with pretty rigorous systems for dealing with that, places like California, Massachusetts and Germany.""\The state will spend millions to train workers for the solar industry. Hemlock alone is expected to receive $5 million for job training, and $6.4 million will be used to create a chemical technology program at Austin Peay State University, where 150 to 175 students a year will be trained in proper handling of chemicals and heavy equipment. Hemlock will contribute $2 million to that program.\Because their product has to be so pure, silicon producers have an incentive to run clean, efficient operations that minimize safety and environmental hazards, said Robin Reed, the Austin Peay chemistry department chairman.\Hemlock and Wacker say they plan to recycle the chemical byproducts from their operations. Hemlock says its final discharge is a salty brine that can be handled by the city sewer.\But Reed said the jump to solar production also provides an opportunity to improve the state's environmental laws.\""The state has its ability to go above and beyond what the federal government has done,"" Reed said. ""Personally, I would like to see Tennessee step up its efforts in terms of its stewardship of the environment and chemicals handling.""\Meanwhile, work has already begun on Hemlock's facility in Montgomery County. Three miles east outside Clarksville, bulldozers are flattening a 1,200-acre farm, preparing the ground for an October start on construction.\Eight hundred people will work at the plant once it opens, and perhaps thousands more from spinoff facilities.\""Look at Spring Hill, what Saturn did for them, and what Fort Campbell has done for our community,"" Clarksville Mayor Johnny Piper said.

\
As chairman of the Federal Communications Commission in the 1990s, Reed Hundt pioneered the auctions of the nation's airwaves that ultimately generated more than $40 billion for the federal Treasury and allowed the cell phone industry to flourish.
\
In his current role as head of the Coalition for Green Energy, Hundt is pushing a similar idea he claims could help to both create green jobs and a cleaner environment without costly government subsidies.
\
Hundt, who heads the Coalition for Green Energy, said Thursday the time has come for the federal government to sell the Tennessee Valley Authority and use the proceeds to create a private, nonprofit Energy Independence Trust to lend money for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.
\
""Selling TVA is certainly not a new idea, but we haven't previously had such a need to jump-start investments in the energy sector like we do today,"" Hundt said. ""If we can successfully sell the government's interest in General Motors today, then maybe it's time we work to auction off the government's major involvement in the energy sector and the crown jewel of that is TVA.""
\
The sale of TVA could prove more attractive in the new Congress than it has in the past. Illinois Republican Sen.-elect Mark Kirk already has proposed selling TVA.
\
But TVA officials and backers insist there is no need to sell TVA, which was created in 1933 to harness the power of the Tennessee River and has grown into the nation's biggest government utility.
\
TVA President Tom Kilgore said the utility has helped deliver reliable power priced nearly 20 percent below the average national rate for residential electricity.
\
""It is a model that has worked well,"" U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander said in October when TVA welcomed its newest board members.
\
In a 21-page plan unveiled this week for ""cutting the cost of clean energy,"" the Coalition for Green Energy and the liberal Center for American Progress suggest that incentives and tax breaks could be used to help control carbon emissions linked with global warming rather than the ill-fated ""cap and trade"" legislation that stalled in the Senate.
\
The auction of TVA, which Hundt estimates could fetch $10 billion or more, is a way to promote green energy initiatives in the private sector rather than relying upon government mandates or programs.
\
""If we can get this money for the sale of TVA, we could agree to plow that money back into sustainable energy projects in the same region so that it will turn into jobs in the Tennessee Valley,"" he said. ""It's a way to solve this terrible unemployment problem.""
\
The plan calls for state regulators to help define the terms of any TVA auction to help protect ratepayers and employees during any sale to rival utilities, such as the neighboring Southern Co., or Duke Energy.
\
Hundt estimates that by leveraging the proceeds from a TVA sale, the Energy Independence Trust could help support up to $100 billion of green energy initiatives.
\
""If that is targeted in the TVA region, everybody in the whole region would be better off with lower unemployment, higher economic growth and a cleaner environment,"" he said.

18,"By SAM STOCKARD STOCKARD@DNJ.COM\-- Sam Stockard, 615-278-5165\From the environment to taxes to planning, Mayo Taylor doesn't shy away from taking on big issues.\She served on the Rutherford County Regional Planning Commission for 11 years and is now on the panel helping form a new planning document. She directed the group that backed a state income tax in Tennessee. But she is most widely known as an environmental advocate, serving as director of the Tennessee Environmental Council for 12 years and helping form what is now the Stones River Watershed Association.\Taylor sat down recently with The DNJ to talk about environmental issues.\Q: You recently visited The DNJ with a group that was backing the American Climate and Energy Act of 2009. Are you in favor of that bill and, if so, why?\Taylor: I am. It's hard to say what form it's going to be in when it finally gets through. But what that entire group is interested in is passage of legislation at the national level that will help provide incentives for businesses and individuals to take action for climate change, which is basically a large list of different types of actions. The whole thing about this climate change, everybody's aware of it now, and we all have to be aware there's no single big thing the country can do as a whole. It's going to be a lot of small steps by businesses, homes and individuals. And the cap-and-trade legislation, what that does is put a business-like approach to it for the business sector being able to buy and sell the right to emit carbon dioxide, basically. It's already been tested out pretty well with acid rain for nitrous oxide cap-and-trade, and now they're hoping to bring that over to the carbon dioxide.\Q: Opponents call the legislation and the cap-and-trade an energy tax that will hurt middle Americans and put people out of jobs. What is your answer to that?\Taylor: Well, there is support in parts of the environmental community for a straight carbon tax with the idea that if fossil fuels cost more, they will be used more carefully. What cap-and-trade tries to do is move off that model and instead use the trading of the ability to emit carbon dioxide to provide financial incentives to businesses to take actions that are going to save money over the long term. And so like with most things dealing with energy, it's taking that long-range look rather than just seeing short-term impact on fuel costs.\Q: Do you believe America's ready to change its reliance on gas and coal.\Taylor: I think we're getting very close to the point where we have no choice, and I do think the public understanding of the need for changes for energy formula is getting pretty strong. We've got a secretary of energy now that is completely committed to it and scientists have put out basically benchmarks that aren't too far out for points that we tip over and we really can't reverse the impacts of what we're doing with our fossil fuel. And so the policy makers have to provide the leadership, but I think the public is beginning to grasp the seriousness of the situation.\Q: You're a longtime member (former president) of the Stones River Watershed Association (It grew out of the Black Fox Wetlands League founded in 1990). How would this type of legislation affect water quality, or would it?\Taylor: Well, everything gets linked up when you start talking about environmental quality, but there's not a lot of direct link on that, although there have been some interesting cases. One that I'll cite is EPA gives awards to industries and communities for water efficiency, and they recently recognized Orange County, Calif., which is near where I grew up, for their water reuse program, and one of the factors was the money that was going to be saved in not having to pump water from northern California. The California aqueduct system is the biggest power user in California, among a lot of big power users, and this is a case in which water efficiency directly results in energy efficiency. And in smaller amounts, that applies all over the country. If we are more efficient in our water uses, less energy is involved in moving it and treating it.\Q: What is your biggest concern right now about the safety of the watershed here?\Taylor: I was on the county planning commission for 11 years, and I've seen the land use changes that have come to our county, and that has a lot of potential to impact our streams. Our streams are just vital living corridors through our communities, but they need protection. They've had benign neglect for a lot of years. As we are active around them, both for development and farming, we need to have a little bit more proactive ability to set some buffers so that they're not destroyed.\Q: Does the watershed association have a big initiative going right now?\Taylor: We do an interesting mix of recreation, education and some advocacy, and right now a lot of our energy is aimed at Boat Day, which is our big event for the year on July 11. And that's an opportunity for people to come out and get in boats on the river. We typically put about 350 people in boats that day, and the idea is that if they enjoy the river, they'll love the river. If they love the river, they'll want to see the river protected, and they'll understand the issues about river protection. And so it's kind of a building block approach, but that's our current energy sink right now.\Q: Of course, boats without motors?\Taylor: Oh yes, these are kayaks and canoes, but we have nothing against boats with motors, fishermen and so forth.\Q: As you said, you're a former member of the Rutherford County Regional Planning Commission, and you're also on the comprehensive plan steering committee (which is helping guide a new planning document). As a member of those, what can you do as a planner to protect the watershed?\Taylor: One of the things that has been ongoing over the last few years, the county and each of the three large municipalities have stormwater programs, and they're mandatory, and they are looking at a lot of applications that help with river protection. They're mapping all the stormwater outflows, they're enforcing riparian buffers, which is very critical, and I think our knowledge of our river corridors is coming along tremendously on that. There's also a whole science of best management practices developing as agencies work on these issues. We've become more knowledgeable about how best to remedy problems with our rivers and how to avoid new problems. It's kind of back to the energy, the Pew Charitable Trust just did a study that found Tennessee was in the top five nationally for what they call clean energy jobs, but they included in that and the basis for Tennessee being in there, was mitigation work. There's been a lot of remediation and environmental mitigation in Tennessee, and as a result of that we have this large growth of jobs in that industry, and I think we're seeing the same thing with protection of water.\Q: Do you have anything else you'd like to add?\Taylor: I think citizens of the state need to be alert to what's going on with our state Legislature, the recently-passed Clean Energy Futures Acts, which both Sen. (Jim) Tracy and Sen. (Bill) Ketron supported, and that puts Tennessee out there in a leadership position on building efficiencies. They need to be aware Tennessee is a leader in the clean energy sector. We've got Hemlock plant coming in up around Clarksville. ... There's just a lot going on with our state, and even though Tennessee's in rough shape, and we've got high unemployment, we've got a tremendous opportunity with clean energy technologies coming in.\Mayo Taylor, environmental advocate\Age: 59\Background: Raised in Elsinore, Calif.\Education: Elsinore Union High School, Class of '67; bachelor's degree University of California-Berkeley, 1971; Peabody College, library degree\Career: Vanderbilt University librarian; director of Tennessee Environmental Council; director of Tennessee Tax Project; faculty librarian at MTSU's James E.

\
Senators from Tennessee and Georgia say there's not much that would warm them up to a bill that calls for a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gases by 2020.
\
""I am concerned that some in Congress and the administration are rushing to judgment on a cap-and-trade system to regulate carbon,"" said Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. ""Cap-and-trade will raise the cost of energy to all Georgians, especially those who rely on electric energy.""
\
The cap-and-trade policy Sen. Isakson described would limit industrial carbon emissions but allow businesses and utilities to buy allowances to exceed those limits.
\
Electric utilities, especially ones that use coal-powered plants that produce greenhouse gases, are expected to have to buy more allowances. That cost would be passed on to customers.
\
U.S. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who is sponsoring the Senate climate bill with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., called the legislation ""a security bill.""
\
""It is our country's defense against the harms of pollution and the security risks of global climate change,"" Sen. Kerry said in a statement.
\
Nuclear energy, once vilified by environmentalists and facing a dim future, has become a pivotal bargaining chip as Senate Democrats hunt for Republican votes to pass climate legislation.
\
The industry's long-standing campaign to rebrand itself as green is gaining footing as part of the effort to curtail greenhouse gases.
\
Nuclear power still faces daunting challenges, including the fate of highly radioactive reactor waste. Reactors remain a tempting target for terrorists, requiring ever vigilant security measures.
\
But 104 power reactors in 31 states provide one-fifth of the nation's electricity. They also are producing 70 percent of essentially carbon-free power and are devoid of greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The Senate this week will kick off three committee hearings on legislation to cap greenhouse gases from power plants and large industrial facilities. The goal is to cut them about 80 percent by 2050. The House already has passed a bill.
\
U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., called the House and Senate climate bills ""a disaster.""
\
He said climate legislation could be a vehicle to energy independence, but the bills in Congress don't do that because they don't promote nuclear power or the use of American resources.
\
""If we would focus solely on climate change, and people wouldn't view this as a mechanism to expand government and line the pockets of interest groups, this whole process would probably be much different,"" Sen. Corker said.
\
U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., said he would support legislation that addresses climate change and energy independence.
\
""However, I will not support legislation that will increase the cost of energy, send American jobs overseas and cause economic pain for no benefit,"" he said.
\
Sen. Corker objects to the money from the allowances going into the federal government's coffers. Instead, he said, they should be returned to taxpayers through dividends or tax credits.
\
But U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said he didn't know if even that would work. Utilities' costs will be passed along to ratepayers, which could drive businesses away even if the funds are returned, he said.
\
""The electric bill for the Volkswagen supplier is going to go up,"" he said. ""So the Volkswagen supplier is going to say, 'Will I be better off in Mexico and Germany or will I be better off in Red Bank?'""
\
Companies should not be given free allowances, as has been discussed, Sen. Corker noted.
\
""It's a huge transference of wealth,"" he said. ""You've got people in the back rooms, staff directors and others, deciding who are going to get those free allowances.""
\
Sen. Alexander also has pushed for nuclear power, calling for 100 new nuclear plants within 20 years. He has called for a new ""Manhattan project"" to figure out how to deal with nuclear waste.

\
Tennessee's business and natural environment could improve if Congress adopts a new energy plan to limit carbon emissions linked with global warming and promote more nuclear and renewable energy production, a coalition of state business leaders said Thursday.
\
""There is no question that clean and renewable energy can result in a lot of job growth and have a major economic benefit for the valley,"" said former Tennessee Valley Authority Director Susan Richardson Williams, a former Tennessee Republican Party chairwoman who helped start Tennessee Business Leaders for a Clean Energy Tomorrow.
\
But other business groups suggest that congressional proposals to cap carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels only will drive up the cost of energy and hurt the economy.
\
""Utilizing the cap-and-trade solution for global warming to me is like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,"" said Deborah Woolley, president of the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ""It will reduce carbon emissions primarily by putting manufacturers out of business and people out of work.""
\
The business groups are fighting over a plan unveiled last week by U.S. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., to cap carbon emissions, create a trading system to allow utilities to use the market to reduce carbon releases and spur cleaner energy through a host of incentives, loan guarantees and research.
\
The measure will increase the costs of burning coal, oil and natural gas. But the tax on such emissions will be used to help consumers pay the expected increase in electricity bills and to encourage utilities and industry to use more nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal and biomass-generated energy.
\
A study by the Pew Charitable Trust found Tennessee ranked third in business growth in clean energy, reflecting the state's research and support of nuclear power, the landing of billion-dollar solar panel manufacturers last year in both Clarksville and Charleston, Tenn., and Nissan's plans to make battery-powered cars at its Smyrna plant. A federal lab for a spent nuclear fuel recycling center proposed in the Kerry-Lieberman bill could be located in Oak Ridge.
\
Ron Kenedi, vice president of Sharp Solar in Memphis, said his factory has grown from 320 employees to nearly 500 in the past year ""and we continue to grow as the U.S. market grows.""
\
While Tennessee is one of the top states for renewable energy businesses, the Volunteer State also has a disproportionate number of energy-intensive businesses drawn to the region by TVA's comparatively low energy costs. Such businesses will suffer -- and could decide to move out of the United States -- if electricity rates go up too much because of the new carbon tax, Ms. Woolley said.
\
But with growing global pressure to control carbon, supporters of the cap-and-trade legislation think it is important to send the right signals to the marketplace about the cost of carbon to spur new technologies.
\
""The landscape is going to change,"" said Jim Frierson, executive director for the Advanced Transportation Technology Institute in Chattanooga. ""Doing nothing is not an option anymore.""
"
21,"
It is early evening on Capitol Hill, and I am sitting with Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, who, along with Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Sen. Joe Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, is trying to craft a new energy bill -- one that could actually win 60 votes.
\
What is interesting about Graham is that he has been willing -- courageously in my view -- to depart from the prevailing GOP consensus that the only energy policy we need is ""drill, baby, drill.""
\
What brought you around, I ask? Graham's short answer: politics, jobs and legacy.
\
We start with politics. The Republican Party today has a major outreach problem with two important constituencies, ""Hispanics and young people,"" Graham explains:
\
""I have been to enough college campuses to know if you are 30 or younger this climate issue is not a debate. It's a value. These young people grew up with recycling and a sensitivity to the environment -- and the world will be better off for it. They are not brainwashed. ... From a Republican point of view, we should buy into it and embrace it and not belittle them. You can have a genuine debate about the science of climate change, but when you say that those who believe it are buying a hoax and are wacky people you are putting at risk your party's future with younger people. You can have a legitimate dispute about how to solve immigration, but when you start focusing on the last names of people the demographics will pass you by.""
\
So Graham's approach to bringing around his conservative state has been simple: avoid talking about ""climate change,"" which many on the right don't believe. Instead, frame our energy challenge as a need to ""clean up carbon pollution,"" to ""become energy independent"" and to ""create more good jobs and new industries for South Carolinians."" He proposes ""putting a price on carbon,"" starting with a very focused carbon tax, as opposed to an economywide cap-and-trade system, so as to spur both consumers and industries to invest in and buy new clean energy products. He includes nuclear energy, and insists on permitting more offshore drilling for oil and gas to give us more domestic sources, as we bridge to a new clean energy economy.
\
""Cap-and-trade as we know it is dead, but the issue of cleaning up the air and energy independence should not die -- and you will never have energy independence without pricing carbon,"" Graham argues. ""The technology doesn't make sense until you price carbon. Nuclear power is a bet on cleaner air. Wind and solar is a bet on cleaner air. ... The future economy of America and the jobs of the future are going to be tied to cleaning up the air, and in the process of cleaning up the air this country becomes energy independent and our national security is greatly enhanced.""
\
What would most help him bring around his GOP colleagues? The business lobby. ""The Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers need to tell my colleagues it is OK to price carbon, if you do it smartly,"" he says.
\
Sure, Graham's strategy will give many greens heartburn. I don't agree with every point. But if there is going to be a clean energy bill, greens and Democrats will have to recruit some Republicans. Graham says he's ready to meet them in the middle. ""We've got to get started,"" he says, ""because once we do, every CEO will adopt a carbon strategy, no matter what the law actually requires."" And for those Republicans who think this is only a loser, Graham says think again: ""What is our view of carbon as a party? Are we the party of carbon pollution forever in unlimited amounts? Pricing carbon is the key to energy independence, and the byproduct is that young people look at you differently.""
\
Look at how he is received in colleges today.
\
""Instead of being just one more short, white Republican over 50,"" says Graham, ""I am now semicool. There is an awareness by young people that I am doing something different.""
\
Five more GOP senators like him and we could have a real energy bill.
\
""We can't be a nation that always tries and fails,"" Graham concludes. ""We have to eventually get some hard problem right.""

The high hope that environmentalists once had held for the international meetings in Copenhagen this month to curb climate change almost surely are on the wane. Those hopes rode on President Obama's pre-election promise to make the United States a meaningful partner in reducing global warming gases, but he has now acknowledged that obstacles in the Senate will stall Washington's legislative advance. The expectation now is for modest progress this year, but hopefully enough to set the stage for more robust measures in a subsequent session next year.
\
To complicate matters, the conference is also slightly haunted by a new conspiracy theory ginned up by climate change naysayers following a round of scientists' e-mails obtained and distributed by a computer hacker.
\
Critics of initiatives to reduce global warming contend the e-mails show that the scientists involved would rig their evidence to make global warming appear more hazardous to the environment that it actually is. Though inappropriate and derisive of warming critics in parts, neutral observers who have studied the e-mails say they fall far short of the claims alleged against them.
\
One example is considered fairly illustrative: One scientists said in an e-mail that a graph showing climate heating trends could be altered by substituting actual thermometer measures where evidence from tree growth rings declined in a particular period. That may have been wrong, but it doesn't disprove the validity of other cumulative evidence from a virtual ocean of scientific work. It certainly does not suggest a larger scientific fraud regarding evidence of climate change that has been very well documented.
\
Indeed, the problem about global warming from manmade emissions is not that the Earth's physical trends are not documentable. Heat-withered croplands and forests, violent weather extremes, polar and high mountain glacial melt, rising oceans, globally threatened sea-coast communities and flood-prone low-lying nations -- all constitute readily observable and measurable trends in the warmest decade on record.
\
The problem is that the U.S. Congress, even more so than the European community, has wedded itself to an expensive and inefficient cap-and-trade plan on greenhouse gas emissions that is designed more to suit big businesses and lobbyists than the needs of the nation as a whole.
\
Opponents of the proposed U.S. cap-and-trade plan have reasonable grounds for skepticism. The plan would fix annually declining caps on greenhouse gas emissions and allow businesses to purchase continuing interim rights to emit pollution in excess of those standards from cleaner companies that exceed required annual reductions. It would also allow businesses to purchase certifiable offsets to carbon dioxide emissions through investments at home and abroad in projects designed to capture emissions, the principal greenhouse gas most commonly emitted by burning fossil fuels. Proof that such offset investments would not have otherwise occurred, however, is difficult to judge and prone to fraud.
\
Cap-and-trade is simply inferior to a tax on carbon emissions, the most direct and surefire way to obtain reductions in bad emissions. Big businesses, vehicle manufacturers, energy industries and, consequently, the politicians they lobby and whose campaigns they fund, are all averse to a carbon tax.
\
They have colluded to devise a system of tax credits (read, taxpayers subsidies), weak and flexible clean-up targets, cap-and-trade purchases and giveaway pollution voucher rights to polluting industries for an interim period, ostensibly to help businesses wind down pollution emissions. These vouchers and cap-and-trade credits and offsets would create a new $1 trillion market in assets that businesses and Wall Street traders could depreciate, sell or manipulate to offset future emission-control costs -- even as many businesses would leave pollution and carbon emission hot-spots in their communities intact and unabated.
\
Ordinary Americans, of course, ultimately would pay the pass-through costs for energy and goods produced by greenhouse emitters -- often without the direct benefit of cleaner air or fewer greenhouse gases in their immediate community. With these defects, controversy deservedly will continue. The only thing worse, for the United States and the world, is to have no concrete plan at all for reducing greenhouse gases.
\
For that reason, the talks in Copenhagen should go forward, especially now that India and China, which has just passed the United States as the world's leading greenhouse gas emitter, have agreed to the need for action. Without meaningful action in Washington and U.S. leadership, however, the talks in Copenhagen won't produce the kind of progress the world needs to avert a frightening level of global warming.

WASHINGTON -- Hours before the House passed its cap-and-trade bill last week, freshman Democrats Tom Perriello and Frank Kratovil were pondering the political fallout of the votes they were about to cast in favor of a plan Republicans were denouncing as ""cap-and-tax.""
\
""Maybe we should be called the conscience caucus,"" said the 34-year-old Perriello, who won his Southside Virginia district last year by 727 votes even as Barack Obama was losing it by 7,512.
\
He recalls Kratovil, 41, replying that perhaps they would be known as the caucus of soon-to-be unemployed congressmen.
\
Kratovil, who narrowly won a Maryland district that Obama lost to John McCain by 18 points, does not remember his precise reply to Perriello. But he acknowledges that ""it would have been easier politically not to take that vote.""
\
That some highly vulnerable Democrats in the House were willing to face tens of thousands of dollars worth of Republican attack ads as the price of supporting a bill to curb global warming is the untold story of what, so far, is the year's most dramatic legislative showdown.
\
Accounts of the battle typically focus on how many industry giveaways were added to the bill to get it passed, how much it had to be weakened to round up the necessary votes, and how much pressure House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Obama brought to win a 219-to-212 majority.
\
All of that is true, but it misses another dimension of the fight: a number of relatively young, politically vulnerable House members who had campaigned on promises to cleanse the environment decided that this vote was a risk worth taking. ""A bill created by the old politics,"" says Perriello, ""was passed by the new politics.""
\
Well, yes, but as Perriello is the first to acknowledge, old politics operated right to the end.
\
Take the cases of Kratovil and Colorado's Betsy Markey, another freshman Democrat from a district Obama lost. Both represent significant numbers of farmers. Their votes weren't secured until the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minn., won last-minute changes protecting farm interests.
\
For Kratovil, one key was making sure that Maryland farmers, who already work under stringent state-imposed environmental standards, would receive the same benefits under the bill as farmers in states with less-demanding rules.
\
For Markey, major issues included helping rural electric cooperatives and protecting dairy farmers who feared the bill might impose a ""cow tax"" on cattle for producing methane by way of, shall we say, a thoroughly natural process.
\
Kratovil said he could not have supported a bill that hurt agriculture, ""which is huge as an economic engine vital to my district."" With the amendments, he was free to vote in line with his core campaign promises: to promote ""renewable fuel, to reduce our dependency on foreign oil, and to protect the environment,"" including the Chesapeake Bay.
\
But another factor is changing the political calculus: the rise of a substantial alternative energy business that encompasses wind and solar. For the first time, the political meaning of the word ""energy"" is not confined to oil and gas, even if old energy is still far more connected politically.
\
Among the employers in Markey's district are Vestas, a leading supplier of wind power, and Abound Solar, a spinoff of research at Colorado State University that manufactures photovoltaic panels.
\
Markey adds that a large strip of her district is one of the most promising parts of the country for producing wind energy, and ""this bill really helps our eastern plains.""
\
Underscoring the dawn of a new energy politics were the eight Republican votes cast in favor of the bill, notably those of Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Castle of Delaware. Both are considering campaigns for the U.S. Senate next year, and they may see a future that others in their party don't.
\
Still, for many potentially vulnerable Democrats who backed the bill, there will be short-run political pain. Perriello and Markey were among 14 House members targeted by the National Republican Congressional Committee for their votes. In Perriello's case, a tough television ad predicts huge increases in electricity prices.
\
Perriello is philosophical about the assault, though he says he's surprised that Republicans are ""using information they know is fundamentally wrong."" He plans to use the July 4th weekend in his district to talk about the urgency of energy independence and the potential for renewable energy jobs. Perriello's fate will be a test of just how new our politics have become.

We've been hearing a lot of criticism of Barack Obama in recent days from pro-Obama corners -- from celebrity investor Warren Buffett, from moderate conservative columnist David Brooks, from one of the Democratic Party's deepest thinkers, William Galston -- all along the same lines. Put aside your plans, announced in your budget, for national health insurance, for a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gases, for effectively abolishing the secret ballot in unionization elections. And, they might have added, for higher taxes on, and a reduction in, their charitable deductions to channel money away from charities and nonprofits and toward the government. Pay attention to the first thing on your platter and the nation's, Buffett and Brooks and Galston say: the financial crisis.
\
The answer Obama has given, in advance, is that we can solve our economic problems only by advancing these other programs. But the real answer came from White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel in November: ""Never let a serious crisis go to waste.""
\
None of the issues addressed in the Obama budget was in any way a cause of the financial crisis. We did not have a housing bubble collapse because we don't have a national health insurance program. We don't have toxic waste clogging the balance sheets of the banks and other financial institutions because of carbon emissions. The Bush tax cuts were not a proximate cause of the giant public debt being run up under the Toxic Assets Relief Program or the 2009 stimulus package.
\
Moreover, as Galston points out, the New Deal doesn't provide a precedent for the Obama budget. In his first months in office, Franklin Roosevelt concentrated on repairing a financial system that was in much worse shape than ours is today. Roosevelt got most of them open and running again. It was a couple of years later that the programs we remember the New Deal for were passed -- Social Security, the Wagner labor act, higher taxes on high earners. (Well, Roosevelt did sneak in repeal of Prohibition.) Even Roosevelt's first expansion of welfare rolls, at the end of 1933, was abruptly canceled when the snows melted in spring 1934.
\
There's another reason to put aside the Obama budget plans. We're in a severe recession, and each of his major proposals is going to stunt the growth of the private sector economy. But most of them -- national health insurance, forced unionization, higher taxes on high earners -- have the offsetting advantage, from Obama's point of view. They would ""spread the wealth around,"" even if there is less wealth to spread around.
\
The same cannot be said of cap and trade. It would take some $600 billion out of the private sector economy to avoid an environmental crisis that is supposed to arrive in -- oh, sometime around 2055. In other words, we are not dealing with here-and-now facts, as we are in the financial crisis, but with predictions based on theories ... theories that have not done a very good job of predicting the climate over the past decade (they said it would get warmer; it's gotten a little colder).
\
We are dealing here with something more like religion and less like science. We are told that all argument about global warming must end. We must have faith! But it is religion that asks us to have faith; science presents us with theories that can be tested by observation and produce replicable results -- and the results for 2055 aren't in.
\
We are told that we must repent of our misdeeds, for driving SUVs or (unless you're Al Gore or a Hollywood liberal) flying in private jets. And we are told that we must atone for our sins by paying more for every bit of energy we use and remembering to recycle.
\
It is religion that asks for repentance and offers rituals for atonement; science suggests ways we can adapt and cope with change. It makes sense to understand how the physical environment may be damaged by changes in climate and to prepare for repairs that may be needed, and we are already doing that. It makes no sense to cripple a struggling economy to prevent damage that may or may not occur many years from now.
\
Voters seem to understand that. Gallup reports that 60 percent of Americans say global warming will not pose a serious threat to them or their way of life in their lifetimes. Or as Stuart Taylor, another moderate critic of the Obama budget, puts it, when your house is on fire, you don't water the lawn.

"
25,"It was unfortunate this week that Republican partisanship in the U.S. Senate stifled important debate on what the U.S. should do about global warming. It was a head-in-the-sand tactic on an important issue that eventually has to be addressed.\At issue was the so-called cap-and-trade legislation that would impose significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. But instead of debating the issue and educating the Senate and the public, some lawmakers were more concerned about election year politics and obstructionist maneuvering. What a shame.\We don't know if cap-and-trade legislation is the right approach for America to take on the global warming issue. But the only way to find out is to have the debate.\Cap-and-trade would require producers of greenhouse gasses to pay for their emissions. Everyone agrees this would add to the cost of most things. And that is what scared off some senators from the debate.\But adding to the cost of items such as gasoline is only part of the story, and likely not the most important part. Depending on the exact approach used, much of the extra cost could be returned to consumers and actually lower their energy costs. In fact, such a proposal was introduced by Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker who has studied the issue extensively. Such a system also would produce a cleaner environment and speed up development of clean energy production. But for now, we won't know whether cap-and-trade is a viable approach because the debate was cut off.\Only steadfast members of the Flat Earth Society still doubt the reality of global warming. It is real, and it has to be addressed. But to do that, we must have the discussion. We must inform ourselves and our lawmakers. We must evaluate the trade-offs, the costs and the benefits of different ways of addressing the problem. And that is the job of Congress, if only it will do it.\Cap-and-trade legislation will be back next year. The political makeup of Congress could be different, and we will have a new president. We can only hope that obstructionist members of the Senate and the House will get their heads out of the sand and join in this important debate."

WASHINGTON -- After taking much heat from Republicans over the past several weeks, Democrats in Congress this week finally agreed to allow the congressional moratorium on offshore oil drilling to expire.
\
Rep. Lincoln Davis, D-Tenn., supported the lifting of the moratorium, but he has not been shy about criticizing Republicans for making drilling the centerpiece of the debate over energy policy, instead of a focus on alternative and renewable energy.
\
""They've been saying that if we lift the moratorium, then the price of gasoline would drop,"" Rep. Davis said. ""Well, let's see. If that doesn't happen, the public should question whether they were playing political games or if they were really trying to solve the country's energy crisis.""
\
WAMP RIPS GREENS ON OIL DRILLING
\
Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., said Democrats lifted the drilling moratorium to give their conservative members political cover as the election approaches.
\
""Politically, it may water down the issue somewhat, so we (Republicans) can't drive it as hard that we need new oil and gas supplies,"" he said.
\
Still, he said as long as extremist environmentalists continue to hold up new drilling through the legal system, the lifting of the moratorium will have a limited effect.
\
""It's not going to bring any oil to the marketplace anytime soon, if the lawsuits and the government are still in the way,"" Rep. Wamp said.
\
CORKER IS AMONG HILL'S WEALTHIEST
\
Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., made the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call's list of the ""50 Richest Members of Congress"" this year, coming in 15th with a minimum net worth of $19.19 million, according to his 2007 personal finance disclosure.
\
""To be a member of Congress, you need to either have a lot of money or have access to a lot of money,"" said Massie Ritsch, communications director for the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in Washington.
\
TVA NOMINEES TO REMAIN IN LIMBO
\
Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said Democratic leaders in the Senate have effectively run out the clock on confirming two of President Bush's nominees to the Tennessee Valley Authority board.
\
Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has pointedly refused to allow a confirmation vote on nominee Susan Richardson Williams, saying he wants more Democratic representation on the utility's board. Another nominee, Michael Bemis, has yet to be vetted by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
\
""I'm disappointed Sen. Reid has been so partisan over it,"" Sen. Alexander said. ""I'm going to keep trying.""
\
The new president would be able to nominate board members of his choosing after he takes office in January.
\
ALEXANDER PUSHES CAP & TRADE PLAN
\
At a global warming conference in Washington this past week, Sen. Alexander said a comprehensive cap and trade bill is unlikely to pass, and he suggested a ""sector by sector"" approach.
\
His proposal would set a cap on greenhouse gas emissions by utilities, create a low carbon fuel standards and refund to taxpayers any money raised through the selling of emissions allowances.
\
""This is much more likely to pass,"" Sen. Alexander said. ""It has no surprises, and it costs less.""
\
A cap and trade program would set emission caps on greenhouse gasses, and companies that emit less than their allotment would be able to sell their credits on the open market. Democrats have been pushing a sweeping cap and trade bill to cover all segments of the economy.

27,"harrop@projo.com\My magic wand is on the fritz, otherwise we'd have a big, new federal program to free America from its dependence on oil. Like other environmentalists, I'm sad that the calamity in the Gulf of Mexico hasn't spurred Washington to more vigorously promote America's exit from this curse.\The fault may lie with President Obama's timidity, a public scared by major new government programs or fossil-fuel interests flashing their campaign dough. Probably it's all three, but the bottom line is this: An all-out effort to unchain America from hydrocarbons is essential to national security, a healthy environment and economic prosperity in the 21st century. But it's not politically possible.\And so we must look at what's passable. Fortunately, there's one piece to the escape strategy that business leaders, military brass and the buying public all like -- and would create jobs. Most importantly, it has bipartisan support in Congress.\We speak of electric cars, specifically the ""Electric Vehicle Deployment Act of 2010."" Sponsored by Sens. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., the bill's goal is to electrify half of America's cars and trucks within 20 years. That, its backers say, would cut America's dependence on petroleum by a third. Similar legislation is before the House.\The Senate bill would name at least five communities to be models for electric-vehicle transportation. They would build stations where motorists could recharge their cars' batteries. Residents would be offered a $10,000 tax credit to buy electric cars. And the federal government would put $1.5 billion into research for improving electric-car technology.\Electric cars don't appear to be a very hard sell to those who would buy them. The first all-electric model, the Nissan Leaf, will hit the U.S. market at the end of the year. (The batteries will be made in Smyrna, Tenn.) But you won't be able to just pick one up, because the year's production is already sold out. More than two-thirds of the 19,000 preorders are from the United States.\The Chevy Volt will reach showrooms around that time. Its battery range of 40 miles is considerably smaller than the Nissan Leaf's 100 miles, but the Volt has a small gasoline engine to keep the car going if a recharging station is not handy.\In any case, more than 75 percent of Americans commute 40 miles or less a day. That means most of them could plug in their Volts at the end of the day and drive off fully charged in the morning.\Being both an environmentalist and a fan of high automotive performance can be awkward. But car makers are learning to put zoom into their fuel-efficient models. The Ford Fusion Hybrid, for example, gets 41 miles-a-gallon in the city, but can pull away from a stoplight at a respectable pace. ""Sustainable mobility solutions"" need not be as boring as they sound.\What about the source of the electric power? Although an all-electric vehicle puts out zero emissions, that is probably not true of the plant that provides the electricity. While California has moved its mix of electricity sources toward clean, renewable energy, other parts of America are still highly dependent on dirty, coal-powered plants.\However, electric cars cut global warming pollution even where coal supplies the power, according to a study by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash. That's because cars plugged in overnight employ unused capacity in the current electric system.\So let the brawl over cap-and-trade proceed. Outside of the oil business, most everyone seems enthusiastic about accelerating a move toward electric cars. Nothing should stop Congress from revving up the process. Right?"
28,"Science is overwhelming, so seek solutions on warming\We admit it. We have not traveled to Antarctica to collect climate change data. We have not developed our own computer models to analyze the impact of greenhouse gases.\Nor have we sampled ocean sediments or studied rainfall records through stalagmites in caves. We have not interviewed a single polar bear.\But neither did we poke our head out on a snowy day last week and assume that was all we needed to know about the hubbub over climate change. We did not consider a recent cold snap to be proof that global warming doesn't exist.\What we have done over the years is pay attention to what scientists say on global warming, just as we would rely on the advice of a physician, not a bartender, about a medical condition. Not being scientific experts, we do what most journalists do to get reliable information: Pay attention to people who know the issue best.\And scientists say in a recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, administered by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization, that global warming is real and that it is very likely being caused by human activity. That follows a similar report in 2001 from that group, but its conclusion is more emphatic now, and that's good enough for us. We believe them.\In fact, many experts insist it is time to get past the issue of whether global warming exists and on to the issue of what to do about it. They are right. Still, there are skeptics who insist global warming is nothing more than a myth.\Global warming is real. It is time to deal with it as reality. That won't be easy either. It will take major changes in habits to get this nation and the rest of the world to stop emitting the greenhouse gases that cause the problem. The world is waking up to the fact that the massive burning of fossil fuels in the last century has taken a damaging toll environmentally. It is not too late to remedy the problem, but it will take time, and it will take willpower.\Recent signs in Washington have some promise. President Bush is urging the nation to pursue a policy that will produce more alternative fuels. He comes late to the table, and his administration's ties to the oil industry have been bad for energy policy, but his acceptance of the need for new fuel sources is a nice development. The nation should support that call. A bill sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., calls for cutting emissions by two-thirds by the middle of the century. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., says the reduction should be even greater, by 80 percent. Even oil companies are beginning to back off from the controversy.\The nation must somehow get away from coal-fired power plants. It won't be easy, and it might be expensive. It might include difficult choices. It could include a sobering debate over whether to revisit nuclear energy. Mandatory limits on emissions are needed. A program to cap and trade emissions credits could be part of the answer.\What's most important now is that everyone should accept the science, admit the problem and spend time discussing the best way to combat global warming, which is far more responsible than pretending the problem doesn't exist."

\
WASHINGTON -- A draft of a climate bill that Senate Democrats formally introduced on Wednesday suggests that the legislation will include a more ambitious greenhouse gas emissions target than one passed by the House.
\
The measure, sponsored by Sens. Barbara Boxer of California and John Kerry of Massachusetts, seeks to achieve by 2020 a 20 percent reduction from 2005 levels of carbon dioxide emissions, compared with 17 percent in the House bill.
\
The House and Senate bills both include a long-term target of an 83 percent reduction by 2050.
\
The Senate bill will be the focus of a political and lobbying struggle, as industry groups, environmental lobbies, local government officials, universities and advocates for the poor all scramble for advantage in legislation that would rewrite the rules of the domestic energy economy.
\
The battle has exposed deep rifts within the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and other business lobbies, with companies leaving their trade organizations almost daily in disputes over climate change legislation. The Chamber of Commerce opposed the House bill and will probably work to weaken or defeat the Boxer-Kerry measure.
\
The bill would set up a cap-and-trade system to achieve the emissions targets, allowing industry and other entities to buy and sell permits within an overall emissions ceiling.
\
The House bill, which narrowly passed in late June, would establish a similar program.
\
But the Senate measure so far leaves a number of crucial questions unanswered, chief among them how the permits to emit carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases would be distributed to utilities, manufacturers, agribusiness and other interests.
\
The allocation of such permits, worth billions of dollars annually, was a subject of intense horse-trading in the House and is certain to touch off a major battle as the Senate debates its own version of the bill.
\
The Boxer-Kerry bill will be considered in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which Boxer heads. Several other Senate panels, including the Finance Committee, led by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., will also play a major role in whatever climate change debate the Senate engages in this fall.
\
Boxer intends to begin hearings on her bill on Oct. 20. The Finance Committee, where the permit-allocation issue and trade questions will be decided, is in the middle of the health care debate and appears to be in no hurry to take on another hugely contentious matter.

DALTON, Ga. -- Rumors of the death of American manufacturing have been greatly exaggerated, officials said Thursday at the 2011 National Manufacturing Summit.
\
But as industry claws its way back from a crippling recession, government policies threaten to strangle the recovery in its infancy, they argued.
\
During five hours of talk here Thursday, political and business leaders blasted what many called dangerous levels of regulatory interference by the federal government while praising the resilience of the American factory and its workers.
\
""Between 2001 and 2010, the value of our manufactured exports grew by 95 percent,"" Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle said. ""A great country that makes nothing won't be great for long.""
\
If energy use is any indication, manufacturing has managed to grow past pre-recession levels, power officials said, even if Georgia's 9.9 percent jobless rate last month remains above the U.S. average.
\
Industrial electricity and gas sales plunged during the recession. But Southern Co., reported a 7.8 percent jump in industrial electricity sales last year and AGL Resources said it has more than recovered from a nearly 35 percent drop in industrial sales of natural gas at the trough of the recession.
\
JOBLESS RECOVERY?
\
But productivity gains have allowed manufacturers to increase production in the latest economic cycle without bringing employees back to the shop floor. In metropolitan Dalton, for instance, about a third, or 23,000 of the area's 66,000 employed workers, are engaged in manufacturing. That's down by nearly 11,000 workers from the peak in 1999, although Dalton still has twice the share of its workers employed in manufacturing as the U.S .average.
\
U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., one of the sponsors of Thursday's summit, argued that overregulation is costing the economy $1.75 trillion a year, which is equal to two stimulus packages such as the one Congress adopted in February 2009.
\
Graves proposed that any regulation that will cost businesses over $100 million must first be approved by Congress to ""disable some overreaching government agencies.""
\
U.S. producers still make 21 percent of global manufactured products, or about $1.6 trillion of value, according to the National Association of Manufacturers. But that's some $150 billion less than the totality of regulations cost the country, according to Graves.
\
REGULATORY CHALLENGES
\
""When I talk to employers throughout this district and elsewhere, and I ask them what is the No. 1 area that inhibits job growth, it's without exception overregulation and the uncertainty of the regulatory environment,"" Graves said.
\
From the still-contentious national healthcare plan to the cap-and-trade proposal that stalled in Congress, many businessmen said they are afraid to make capital investments and hire employees until they know how much it is going to cost, he said.
\
Southern Co. CEO Tom Fanning said proposed new pollution controls on coal-fired power plants are likely to cost far more than the $10.9 billion annual expense estimated by the Environmental Protection Agency.
\
Electricity rates could rise by 20 percent because of the EPA rules over the next four years, hurting the competitiveness of U.S. industry, he said.
\
The price of installing natural gas pipelines has quadrupled over the past decade to an average of $4 million per mile for Southern Natural Gas, company President Norman Holmes said.
\
If legislators don't take a hard look at which laws are harming businesses and hindering production, ""our children and grandchildren will be challenged to achieve the standard of living we have enjoyed,"" said Werner Braun, president of the Carpet and Rug Institute.
\
Environmental and consumer groups, however, claim that savings in health costs and saved lives more than justify the expense to implement the new rules.
\
But sometimes those regulations go too far, said Chip Howalt, president of Textile Rubber and Chemical Co.
\
Howalt said the estate tax forced his company to split in two, and he expects health care costs to rise from the health insurance reform package adopted by Congress in 2010.
\
""Roughly 50 percent of second-generation companies fail,"" he said. ""All the things chemical manufacturers have to do annually to comply with regulations and keep up with the new ones being brought on are staggering.""
\
As private companies have cut costs to comply with regulations, the government's budget has ballooned, said economist Steve Moore, a member of the Wall Street Journal editorial board.
\
GOVERNMENT BORROWING SOARS
\
If government borrowing for the next 10 years increases at its current pace, it will outpace all U.S. borrowing from 1776 to 2005, he said.
\
""If we don't get this under control, we will face a national crisis,"" Moore said.
\
But educators, who supply the skilled labor necessary to work in an increasingly technical environment, worried that cuts to technical institutions and K-12 schools could hurt manufacturing.
\
""From the work force side, we've relied on a number of federal programs to support our students,"" said Ron Jackson, commissioner of the Technical College System of Georgia. ""We need at least some of them to stay in place for our students.""
\
Energy and carpet leaders called for a national energy policy, which would help move the country away from foreign oil and toward domestic sources of energy.
\
""The talk of oil getting to $200 to $300 per barrel is a frightening prospect because it could literally price our product out of the market,"" said Vance Bell, CEO of Shaw Industries, one of the nation's biggest carpetmakers.

Fervent. 1. Hot, burning, glowing, boiling. -- Oxford English Dictionary
\
WASHINGTON -- ""Fervently"" is how America will henceforth engage in talks on global warming. So said the president's climate change negotiator last week in Germany, at a U.N. conference on reducing carbon emissions. This vow was fervently applauded by conferees welcoming the end of what an Associated Press news story called the Bush administration's ""eight years of obdurate participation"" in climate talks.
\
Reducing carbon emissions supposedly will reverse warming, if it resumes after the current period without warming, a period that began, according to statistics published by the World Meteorological Organization, 11 years ago. Regarding the reversing, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has many ambitions, as outlined in a working group's 16-page ""information note"" to ""facilitate discussions."" For example:
\
""Tariffs can be lowered to grant special preference to climate-friendly goods, or they can be maintained at high levels to discourage trade in GHG (greenhouse gas)-intensive goods and services."" The working group says protectionism ""in the service of climate change objectives"" might virtuously ""shelter domestic producers of climate-friendly goods.""
\
Furthermore, using ""border carbon adjustment,"" a nation might virtuously ""impose costs on imports equivalent to that (sic) faced by domestic producers"" operating under a carbon tax. Or a nation with a cap-and-trade regime regulating carbon emissions by domestic manufacturers might require foreign manufacturers ""to buy offsets at the border equal to that (sic) which the producer would have been forced to purchase had the good been produced domestically.""
\
Cynics will see only potential for mischief by governments, including the U.S. government, using such measures to give a green patina to protectionism. Meanwhile, the U.S. government is having its own problems with one ""climate-friendly good"" that might not be. Last week The New York Times front page carried this headline: ""The Bulb That Saved the Planet May Be a Little Less Than Billed.""
\
The story recounted some Americans' misadventures with the new light bulbs that almost all Americans -- all but those who are filling their closets with supplies of today's incandescent bulbs -- will have to use after the phaseout of today's bulbs in 2014. (You missed that provision of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007?)
\
A San Francisco -- naturally -- couple emerged from Al Gore's movie ""An Inconvenient Truth"" incandescent with desire to think globally and act locally, in their home. So they replaced their incandescent bulbs with the compact fluorescents that Congress says must soon be ubiquitous. ""Instead of having a satisfying green moment, however,"" the Times reported, ""they wound up coping with a mess.""
\
Although supposed to last 10,000 hours and save, the Times says, ""as much as"" $5.40 a year in electricity costs, some bulbs died within a few hours. Some experts, reports the Times, ""blame the government for the quality problems,"" saying its push to cut the bulbs' prices prompted manufacturers to use inferior components.
\
Furthermore, some experts have written a guide saying the new bulbs require ""a little insight and planning."" The Times says that ""may be an understatement.""
\
The bulbs, says the Times, ""do not do well in hot places with little airflow, like recessed ceiling fixtures,"" and some do not work ""with dimmers or three-way sockets."" And: ""Be aware that compact fluorescents can take one to three minutes to reach full brightness. This is not a defect."" Well, if you say so. Because all fluorescents contain mercury, a toxic metal, they must never be put in the trash, so Home Depot and other chains offer bins for disposing of dangerous bulbs. Driving to one of these disposal points might not entirely nullify the bulbs' environmental benefits. Besides, the Times summarizes the Environmental Protection Agency's helpful suggestions for coping with the environmental dangers caused when one of these environment-saving bulbs breaks:
\
""Clear people and pets from the room and open a window for at least 15 minutes if possible. Avoid vacuuming. Scoop up larger pieces with stiff paper or cardboard, pick up smaller residue with sticky tape, and wipe the area with a damp cloth. Put everything into a sealed plastic bag or sealed glass jar. In most cases, this can be put in the trash, but the EPA recommends checking local rules.""
\
Worrywarts wonder what will happen when a lazy or careless, say, 10 percent of 300 million Americans put their worn-out bulbs in the trash. Stop worrying. What do you think? That Congress, architect of the ethanol industry and designer of automobiles, does not think things through?
\
Washington Post Writers Group
"
32,"
WASHINGTON -- If legislation were dirt, Democrats would have piled up a mountain of it over the past 18 months, digging themselves in a deep political hole in the process.
\
The House that Nancy (Pelosi) built continues to ramrod new policies through the legislative process, hoping the bustle will salve America's sour mood. Senate Democrats move a little more slowly due to different institutional rules, yet their hearts are in the same place: the more legislative production, the better.
\
That's what legislators do, after all. New laws are like seed corn, intended to grow public support.
\
But it's not working. The congressional majority keeps passing initiatives it says respond to the public's desire for ""change."" Yet the combination of current liberal initiatives and uncertainty about future policies now seriously hampers economic growth and business risk-taking. It's also taking a toll on congressional standing with voters.
\
Gallup reinforced this point last week, reporting that Congress' job-approval rate hovered near an all-time low of 20 percent.
\
Perceived liberalism in the lawmaking process may also affect Americans' ideological self-identification. Gallup issued a separate study recently, demonstrating a significant rise in the number of Americans describing themselves as conservatives since the 2008 election.
\
Near-record numbers now also say that the Democratic Party is ""too liberal.""
\
Congressional Democrats must have heavy heads not to hear and see all this. Weighed down with tin ears and political blinders, they think Americans want what they're selling.
\
True, some partisan Democrats and their media cheerleaders do. New York Times columnist Gail Collins swooned about Nancy Pelosi last week. Writing a love song fit for a Democratic National Committee rally, Collins gushed that the California Democrat was ""the most powerful woman in the country, the most fearless person on Capitol Hill and on track to be one of the most productive speakers in history.""
\
But independents worry that ""productive"" translates to ideologically indulgent, like playing political roulette with other people's money. In fact, Gallup tracking data on ideology shows a significant rise in conservatism among independents over the past two years. And some point to the Democratic agenda as a primary cause of this shift.
\
Michael Boland, a former senior House GOP leadership aide, who now runs Dome Advisors, a Washington-based research company for institutional investors, sent out an analysis to his clients last week that sums up how Democrats' hyperactive legislating and spending affects independent voters.
\
""What motivates Democrats to push an agenda that pushes the independents away?"" Boland asks. ""Democrats believe in their agenda. They believe it is why they were elected. They believe every one of their voters deserves his or her very own subsection in their city-size 2,000-plus page 'comprehensive' bills on federal stimulus spending, health care, energy, environment and banking. Democrats believe their body of work will boost their electoral prospects.""
\
In other words, every problem deserves a federal government fix using your money. Democrats reshaped the health care system, the student loan business, spent hundreds of billions on a stimulus bill, and passed massive cap-and-trade legislation in the House.
\
Their agenda is not only pushing independents away. It's also terrifying the folks creating jobs in this country: American businesses.
\
Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon CEO and chairman of the Business Roundtable, blistered the Democrats in a recent speech at the Economic Club of Washington.
\
""We have become somewhat troubled by a growing disconnect between Washington and the business community that is harming our ability to expand the economy and grow private-sector jobs in the U.S.,"" said Seidenberg.
\
Writing about the Seidenberg speech, The Wall Street Journal's Kimberly Strassel said the business community now suffers from a serious case of ""buyer's remorse"" when it comes to Democrats in Congress.
\
Democrats argue we can get the economy humming again if more people get government employment. That's an unsustainable and misguided goal.
\
CNBC's Jim Cramer concurred. ""With no employment growth, and a fear that Washington's anti-stock agenda will crimp the earnings of all kinds of companies across the board, the sense of doom and gloom, the Jimmy Carter-esque malaise, is almost palpable,"" he said.
\
Stock market jitters and volatility this past week support that verdict.
\
Yet it's more than just the legislative substance that bothers independents, business leaders and others. It's also the congressional style. House Democrats typically pass every major bill on near party-line votes.
\
Strategies like this may thrill Democratic partisans, but it leaves a majority wondering why the process is so divisive and polarized.
\
Slowing down and building more consensus would improve the Democrats' approval numbers. Yet that would mean modifying their agenda, a set of programs they want to enact before voters take away these politicians' shovels in November.

33,"
If it wasn't already, it is now reasonable to question each savory morsel of Al Gore's enviro-babble. Heck, go ahead and pitch that not-quite-dog-eared gift copy of ""An Inconvenient Truth"" into the recycle bin.
\
You see, Gore recently admitted that at least part of his green activism has hurt the country and was raw political opportunism.
\
No really, he said so. Speaking at a ""green energy"" conference in Greece, he renounced his early support for ethanol.
\
""It is not a good policy to have these massive subsidies for [corn-based] ethanol,"" said Gore, who in the '90s cast a tie-breaking Senate vote to uphold a requirement that ethanol be blended into the nation's fuel supply.
\
So, now that ethanol is getting $8 billion a year in U.S. subsidies -- subsidies that will not end even though Cap'n Planet himself admits they're bad policy -- he issues the equivalent of a ""My bad.""
\
The subsidies were ""a mistake,"" he said, according to Reuters news service. But, ""It's hard once such a program is put in place to deal with the lobbies that keep it going.""
\
Do tell.
\
Alas, U.S. solvency was not his chief concern when he was giving away the store to the farm lobby: He was focused on the manifestly more important objective of succeeding Bill Clinton.
\
""One of the reasons I made that mistake [supporting ethanol] is that I paid particular attention to the farmers in my home state of Tennessee, and I had a certain fondness for the farmers in the state of Iowa because I was about to run for president,"" he breezily admits, as the ethanol cancer continues to metastasize throughout our economy.
\
He even acknowledges that diverting so much corn to ethanol as a payoff to farm states raised the cost of food.
\
""The size, the percentage of corn particularly, which is now being [used for] first-generation ethanol definitely has an impact on food prices,"" he said. ""The competition with food prices is real.""
\
Yeah. So are damaged engines, reduced gas mileage and higher national debt, all brought to you by the magic of taxpayer-funded ethanol.
\
Equally real are Gore's lavish investments in ""green energy"" -- investments that will pay off with river barge loads of cash if Congress passes cap-and-trade or President Obama imposes similar nonsense by executive order.
\
I suppose there is still some technical difference between Washington and the Mafia, but the distinction gets harder to detect by the day.
\
ENDANGERED OBJECTIVITY
\
See if you can spot the difference, other than source and subject matter, between these passages:
\
* ""... Arab political movements such as Hamas that the U.S. government has designated as terrorist organizations."" -- The Associated Press
\
* ""A federal appeals court on Tuesday halted the killing of sea lions that had been feeding on endangered salmon along the Columbia River ... ."" -- the Los Angeles Times
\
Here's the inconsistency: When the U.S. government labels a radical Muslim terrorist group a ""terrorist organization,"" the media often insist on meticulously attributing that designation to the government -- as if there were room for doubt. Yet when the government has labeled a species endangered, the need for fussy attribution of that claim frequently disappears. We are simply to accept it as Truth -- on the order of ""Lemons are tart"" or ""Al Gore is brilliant"" -- that mankind is despoiling the environment and killing off species.
\
My, what selective skepticism.
\
I can't say whether salmon in the Columbia River will die out, and neither can the government, the Los Angeles Times or peckish sea lions. I can say, with painful certainty, that Hamas has the blood of innocent men, women and children on its hands -- and that those civilians were not unintended casualties of war but deliberate targets of attacks including bus bombings. That's not guesswork; Hamas takes eager credit for its butchery.
\
But while Hamas' status as a terrorist organization is posited as a matter for debate, the iffier question of whether environmentally correct salmon are dying off is treated as outside the realm of polite inquiry.
\
And it's not only Hamas that enjoys the benefit of undeserved media doubt. Recall the freakish statement by Steven Jukes, Reuters' global head of news, in a memo to staff soon after al-Qaida annihilated nearly 3,000 Americans: ""We all know that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter and that Reuters upholds the principle that we do not use the word terrorist ... .""
\
I'm not sure why he thinks we ""know"" any such thing, but tell you what: When we can all call terrorists ""terrorists"" -- without any need for attribution to some government department -- I'll admit that salmon are in trouble.
\
Until then, one man's endangered species is another man's supper.

Lamar Alexander will say during hearings on climate change legislation this week that the measure would cost jobs and stymie economic growth.\Hearings on the legislation, sponsored by Democrat Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts and Barbara Boxer of California, begin today before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\Alexander, a member of the committee, held a conference call Monday to preview the objections he will raise to the legislation.\His outlook is important beyond Tennessee because he is the third-ranking Republican in the Senate and the person in charge\of crafting and publicizing the GOP message on issues.\Alexander said he accepts that the climate is changing, largely due to man-made conditions.\""I don't have an issue with the problem,"" Alexander said. ""My problem is with the solution.""\The centerpiece of the Kerry-Boxer proposal is a plan to gradually reduce the carbon that could be emitted nationwide. It would allow companies that don't reach emissions targets to buy allowances from companies that meet the targets with room to spare. The idea is to use market forces to reduce overall carbon emissions.\The head of the Congressional Budget Office testified earlier this month that the House version of the cap-and-trade system would cut the nation's gross domestic product by 0.25 percent to 0.75 percent in 2020 and by 1 percent to 3.5 percent in 2050.\Congressional Democrats and others contend that the system would create green-energy jobs.\The GOP alternative\Alexander's four-point GOP alternative would:\* Build 100 nuclear plants in 20 years.\* Electrify half the nation's cars and trucks in 20 years.\* Explore offshore sources of natural gas.\* Invest in research to find ways to capture carbon generated by coal-fired utilities, make solar power more financially viable, improve battery technology, and deal with waste from nuclear power generation.\In addition to the cap-and-trade system, the 821-page Senate bill would promote energy conservation, encourage development of more nuclear power and alternative energy sources, and support research on advanced energy technologies.\Today, the committee will hear from top administration officials, including Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson.\The other two days will include testimony from numerous utility executives, environmental groups, academic experts, union leaders and business groups.\Contact Bill Theobald at wtheobal@gannett.com."
35,"To hear the 24-hour news establishment and conservative pundits and bloggers tell it, the concept of manmade global warming is melting under scientists' feet.\They point to the leaked e-mails from a British university in December that suggested climate scientists were discussing how to avoid public-information laws. They detail recent revelations that a key United Nations report on climate change contained flawed information, such as the assertion that Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035. They cap the discussion with results of a Gallup poll that finds that almost half of Americans believe global warming is overblown, and that two-thirds of respondents don't think climate change will affect them in their lifetimes.\These points are rolled together to make it appear that global warming is a hoax, and that people should continue to neglect or abuse the environment.\But Americans should not be fooled. These assertions are being distorted by those whose interests are served by the failure of proposed climate-change legislation and by our nation's continued overconsumption of disposable products and fossil fuels. And they don't mind impugning science in general by exaggerating the transgressions of a few.\Neither the substance of the stolen university e-mails nor the errors in the report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change refute decades of scientific research pointing to the proliferation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases emitted by cars, factories and power plants.\The problems lie with a lack of peer review for the body's work. The U.N. has moved to address that, arranging a review of the report by a group of top scientists chosen by the independent InterAcademy Council.\As for Gallup and other public-opinion polls showing greater doubts about global warming, they mainly serve to show the impact of the well-funded campaign to discredit climate science in the U.S., not any revelation about climate science itself.\And just as with polling about health-care reform, the headlines don't give a complete picture. Many of the same respondents who say they doubt global warming also say they support limiting greenhouse-gas and carbon emissions to boost energy independence and create clean-energy jobs.\Those practices also will reduce global warming's predicted impact on glaciers, low-lying population areas, and the world's plants and wildlife. And they are the chief arguments behind climate legislation supported by President Barack Obama that passed the House last summer but has stalled in the Senate. That bill has particularly been targeted by climate-change deniers since its centerpiece is a ""cap-and-trade"" program that they argue will be too costly to industries.\However, Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass.; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.,are working on a version that would apply separate controls to electric utilities, transportation and industry instead of a broad cap-and-trade approach, and still cut greenhouse emissions by\17 percent by 2020.\Their version also would expand offshore oil and gas drilling and provide some assistance for nuclear-plant construction -- neither endearing to environmentalists, yet this broad-based compromise may be the best way forward for the U.S. at this critical time.\The fight against very real global warming should proceed on a dual track, with government setting workable limits on big polluters and all Americans learning to conserve energy use and minimize waste. We can adopt these practices and listen to all sides about climate change, and be comfortable that we are doing the right thing."
36,"THE TENNESSEAN\Like me, you know that polls come a dime a dozen. You can find them on everything from what type of job you think the president is doing, to health care, to what type of automobile best suits your needs.\I took part in a conference call this past week on a poll that had been conducted recently, but before I tell you about it, let me ask you a few questions:\* Is global warming or climate change a major, moderate or minor problem, or not a problem at all?\* Do you believe environmental conditions will be worse for future generations?\* How much can federal, state and local governments, as well individuals like yourselves, do to reduce global warming?\* Are you willing to pay more for electricity to combat global warming -- perhaps an additional $10 per month?\* Do you support ""cap-and-trade"" proposals to lower greenhouse gas emissions?\* Would you be interested in purchasing gas-electric hybrid cars when replacing your current vehicle?\* Where do you get your information about heat warnings -- from television, radio, newspapers, the Internet, family, friends?\Pretty interesting questions, right? But again, how would you answer them?\The conference call I was on Wednesday morning had to do with a national poll of African-American views on global climate change and what to do about it.\The survey also asked the respondents their views on the ""cap-and-trade"" legislation that was passed earlier this year by the U.S. House of Representatives.\I'm sure the answers given in the survey will be similar to those some of you would give, but I thought I would share some of them with you today, since officials at the Washington-based Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, which conducted the survey, say African-Americans are underrepresented in the public debates on climate change and environmental issues generally.\Despite that, ""they are as aware of these issues as other groups in American society, and committed to action -- both personal and governmental -- to deal with the problems associated with climate change,"" the center said.\The survey of 750 adult respondents nationwide by the center, one of the nation's leading research and public policy institutions and the only one whose work focuses on issues of particular concern to African-Americans and other people of color, showed that a majority of African-Americans believe climate change (and global warming) is a major problem. A majority of African-Americans believe these problems will be worse for future generations.\They also believe, according to the survey, that global warming will have significant negative effects on public health and economic instability through severe weather events.\The survey showed, too, that majorities of African-Americans believe government at all levels can take actions to limit these problems. But they also believe individuals can help mitigate the effects of climate change -- and a majority of them ""recycle and purchase energy saving appliances and lightbulbs, while nearly half of them purchased products in the last year that were better for the environment even though the products were more costly than similar non-environmentally friendly items.""\Like all Americans, the Joint Center's survey showed that African-Americans are wedded to their cars, with about half of black households having two or more cars and only one-sixth of households carless.\The full report can be found at www.jointcenter.org/climate. Regardless of who you happen to be, why not take a look at the questions asked and see how you would answer them? I'm sure your answers will be similar to the survey respondents; that is, depending on your income and where you live.\Dwight Lewis is editorial page editor for The Tennessean.

Do you think your taxes are high enough already? Or do you like the idea of having a $2,000 ""anti-warming tax"" added for you to pay each year?
\
The Heritage Foundation does not think that is an idle question. Its analysis of President Barack Obama's proposed energy bill, say Heritage researchers Nicholas Loris and Ben Lieberman, ""is backed with more subsidies and mandates for unsuccessful, unproved energy sources. It also would raise taxes on reliable energy sources and sock consumers with a new global warming tax amounting to $2,000 a year for a typical household.""
\
The Heritage Foundation analysts say that instead of stimulating the economy, ""this government-centric approach would kill jobs and drive up energy prices for years to come.""
\
The legislation against which this warning has been given was introduced in Congress March 31 by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House Energy and Environment Subcommittee. Their goal is to impose ""cap and trade"" levies that are supposed to reduce carbon dioxide and slow global warming.
\
But, said Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Loris, ""The reality is that any carbon-capping plan is a costly energy tax in disguise -- raising energy prices and unemployment with little, if any, environmental benefit.""
\
Since we get about 85 percent of U.S. energy from fossil fuels, a Heritage Foundation study suggests that adding cap-and-trade costs would ""sap nearly $5 trillion from the nation's economic output and cost 400,000 to 800,000 jobs a year.""
\
We have heard a lot about the possibility of ""global warming."" Nearly everyone is ""against it."" But just a few years ago, we were warned that we were facing disastrous ""global cooling."" Climate goes in cycles. Which are we really facing now? How much influence does ""manmade"" activity have, and how much involves natural changes over which we have minimal control? The debate goes on.
\
But there really is no debate about the fact that if what Rep. Waxman and Rep. Markey propose becomes law, it would add tremendous costs. They would be hidden in all sorts of energy bills. But the ultimate price would have to be paid by all of us consumers, which the Heritage researchers suggest might be $2,000 per American household each year.
\
We'd better find out a whole lot more about the global warming theory and the very great tax cost of the Waxman-Markey plan before we let Congress impose something very expensive upon us all.
"
38,"On this day, the 39th observance of Earth Day, the debate over the environment has never been more promising, or more contentious.\New leadership in Washington has taken a 180-degree turn away from climate-change denial of the past administration and embraced scientific findings on global warming and the need to develop alternative energy sources.\However, the pushback by opponents also has grown more intense, with the flagging economy being used as a potent excuse not to expand environmental initiatives.\Yet, new programs and policies are progressing at the federal, state and local government levels:\* Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency set the stage for regulating carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases, saying car and factory emissions ""endanger public health and welfare.""\* Democrats in Congress are working on legislation to establish a ""cap-and-trade"" system, requiring industries to limit pollution or else trade credits to companies that do.\* In Tennessee, Gov. Phil Bredesen has proposed a clean-energy initiative that includes legislation to make state buildings and private homes more energy-efficient.\* Mayor Karl Dean's Green Ribbon Committee on Environmental Sustainability last week recommended 16 goals for Nashville, from developing a locally based food system, to ensuring every Nashvillian has non-motorized and mass-transit transportation options, to cleaning up the city's rivers and streams.\And where government has not acted, grass-roots groups, businesses and individuals are stepping up.\Yes, businesses. Contrary to what you may hear, much of the private sector has embraced green initiatives, with an eye toward sustainability. It's simply good business.\In Nashville particularly, a number of builders are moving to green construction practices, and others make a living by rehabilitating older buildings to make them safe and energy-efficient. Some companies are switching their fleets to hybrids and cutting back on trips altogether.\Look for sustainability practices to spread through the private sector slowly but surely. On the national and state levels, expect a fight. On Tuesday, Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee tried to block discussion of the cap-and-trade legislation, saying that Democrats are trying to move the bill too quickly without addressing costs.\But a middle ground can be reached. While some House Democrats want emission permits to be given free to some industries, President Obama, like GOP leaders, wants the legislation to require emission permits be auctioned, with proceeds offsetting the accompanying rise in electricity costs. On so important a matter, the two sides need to find a way to compromise.\In the Tennessee legislature, a number of bills are being considered that could harm water quality by relaxing rules on release of pollutants by coal and a handful of other industries. Since these bills seem destined for passage in the Republican-controlled houses, it must be up to the governor, or to concerned citizens groups, to reverse the course. These are simply bad bills, designed to benefit a few, but have the potential to harm many.\So on this Earth Day, consider that the planet's survival is balanced on two rails -- one that calls for broad governmental regulation that must have buy-in from the majority of the American public, and the other, the individual who tries to conserve and live ""green"" in their daily life.\Without one or the other, Earth will before long be hard-pressed to sustain humankind."

WASHINGTON -- The political collars continue to tighten around Blue Dogs and other Democrats representing Republican-leaning congressional districts.
\
Recent election results in Virginia and New Jersey, plus a bevy of opinion polls, suggest these vulnerable lawmakers face an increasingly hostile environment entering an election year.
\
At-risk Democrats are experimenting with different voting strategies to achieve political survival. Some support the White House, calculating that cozying up to the president and liberal interest groups will yield electoral dividends. Others are distancing themselves from a president rapidly losing altitude with swing voters. Time will tell which strategy works better.
\
Yet a return to normal voting patterns -- after GOP underperformance in 2006 and 2008 in some of these districts -- could swamp many Democrats next year, no matter how they position themselves.
\
Moderate-to-conservative Democrats in Congress always confront a tough balancing act. Many of their constituents oppose their party leadership's agenda. So they take their lumps -- either from their own caucus or from the folks back home. Blue Dogs wrestle with this form of political schizophrenia daily.
\
It used to be easier. President Bill Clinton, for example, understood the vulnerable Democrats' plight. He spoke of finding a ""third way"" and ""triangulated"" between Republicans and the most liberal elements of his own party. His rhetoric gave Blue Dogs a comfortable home.
\
During George W. Bush's presidency, these vulnerable Democrats regularly found solace in opposing the White House with conservative panache. Mr. Bush's tax cuts ""ran up the debt,"" he didn't ""pay for"" the Medicare prescription drug benefit, and the war in Iraq was too costly. Blue Dogs opposed the president without losing their conservative credentials.
\
Today it's more complicated. This White House does not proffer ""third way"" rhetoric. Obama also yields policy details to a congressional leadership more beholden to liberals. Progressive groups and bloggers make a lot of noise about Blue Dogs who oppose a ""progressive"" agenda.
\
Vulnerable Democrats either must embrace policies often unpopular in their districts, like health care legislation, cap and trade and even a big-spending stimulus proposal -- or appear like traitors in their caucus and face the wrath of liberal interest groups.
\
Veteran political analyst Jim Ellis, who writes a newsletter called PRIsm, notes that Blue Dogs split on the health care and cap-and-trade votes -- 17 supported both bills, while 18 opposed the two measures. (The other 17 divided their votes for and against).
\
Consider lawmakers such as Reps. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., Zack Space, D-Ohio, or Baron Hill, D-Ind. President Obama got less than 50 percent in their districts, yet all three supported both controversial measures. They hope these votes translate into high enthusiasm among Democratic activists in their districts.
\
Some think it might work. ""These lawmakers should be able to survive those votes if they do all the right blocking and tackling back home,"" a former Republican congressional chief of staff who worked for several vulnerable members told me. And the resources provided by a supportive White House and Democratic base would help the lawmakers do that.
\
Others make a different calculation. Some, like Reps. Bobby Bright, D-Ala., Parker Griffin, D-Ala., and Walt Minnick, D-Idaho -- whose districts gave Obama less than 40 percent of the vote in 2008 -- told their leadership ""no way."" But can that save them?
\
""It could if this is not a 'wave' election,"" the Republican chief of staff told me. ""But those districts that lean the other way are never safe from a national wave. In that scenario, it will be the letter next to their name (R or D), that will dictate their fate, rather than a single vote.""
\
Ellis agrees. He told me 15-20 seats may swing back Republican assuming 2010 just returns to normal electoral patterns. Some of these Democrats were elected in 2006 and 2008 -- years when the landscape tilted unusually against Republicans. How these lawmakers vote in Washington may matter less than who turns out on Election Day.
\
The Obama-Pelosi agenda is not doing vulnerable Democrats any favors.

40,"By THE DAILY NEWS JOURNAL\Sen. Lamar Alexander's proposal to shift toward nuclear power holds some merit, but it is also riddled with questions that Americans have been slow to answer.\Alexander recently said he believes the nation should build 100 nuclear plants over a 20-year period with the federal government stepping up grants to developers and increasing funding for disposal of radioactive waste.\The Republican senator from Tennessee pointed out that, even though nuclear facility safety has improved since disasters at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, no nuclear plants have been built in the nation in 30 years while Europeans have forged ahead with the technology.\Public opposition and expense, as well as a growing tide toward wind and solar energy, could prove to be stumbling blocks for Alexander's idea.\Groups such as Sierra Club, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Tennessee Environmental Council recently petitioned the Nuclear Regulatory Agency to stop TVA from opening a second reactor at its Watts Bar Plant in Spring City, contending design weaknesses in the reactor could pose a threat to the Tennessee River.\TVA also operates nuclear plants at Browns Ferry near Athens, Ala., and Sequoyah in Soddy-Daisy. The three plants contributed 6,900 megawatts of electricity to TVA's power grid, roughly 30 percent of its power and enough to serve 3 million homes in the Tennessee Valley.\Nevertheless, TVA's estimated cost to build the Bellefonte Nuclear Plant in Alabama climbed anywhere from $9.8 billion to $17.5 billion from $7.1 billion just a year ago, according to a recent report. TVA also wants to build a nuclear power plant on the Clinch River near Knoxville where it stopped working on a nuclear breeder reactor 25 years ago.\Even though Alexander called on the federal government to make federal loan guarantees of $18 billion to $50 billion for development, the funding wouldn't come close to providing enough money for 100 nuclear plants.\In addition, the Institute for Energy and the Environment and Vermont Law School determined 100 nuclear reactors would cost $1.9 trillion to $4.1 trillion more over time than more energy efficient and renewable sources.\The United States still hasn't figured out what to do with nuclear waste from spent fuel rods. Yucca Mountain in Nevada is being considered as a long-term burial location, but it has been facing opposition for more than 20 years.\The Not In My Backyard syndrome will always cause problems for nuclear power and disposal because people fear what could happen in case of an accident. Certainly, coal ash disposal isn't fool-proof, either, based on the environmental disaster at Kingston Fossil Fuel Plant in East Tennessee.\Nuclear power certainly has its place in the future of America's energy independence. But before the nation jumps into a plan for 100 plants over 20 years, it needs to make sure the regulations and technology are environmentally sound and that the rules don't change in the middle of the game and further drive up the cost.\More emphasis also needs to be placed on solar, wind and other alternatives that are finally gaining some attention in the marketplace of ideas. Windmills may not look pretty in the hills of East Tennessee, but they don't create nuclear waste, either.\Americans need to put as much of their brain power into the future of energy as they did into space exploration in the 1960s.\People depend on energy each day for basic needs. For too long, though, we took for granted the ability to flip on the light switch at night or turn up the thermostat to stay cool in the summer.\Alexander's nuclear ideas run counter to the cap-and-trade bill Congress is considering to cut pollution and increase energy independence. If his proposal is intended only to undermine President Obama's proposal, it loses a great deal of merit.\More than likely, America's answer to energy lies somewhere in between, with more research on nuclear, wind, solar and other sources that haven't even been considered yet, along with reductions in emissions from manufacturing facilities across the nation. Energy efficiency in homes and buildings will also play a crucial role in our future.\Before the nation moves wholly toward cap-and-trade or nuclear expansion, the technology and the consequences must be clearly defined.\------\Opinions in this space reflect a consensus of the discussion by The Daily News Journal Editorial Board. The Board includes Andrew Oppmann, president and publisher; Jimmy Hart, executive editor; Sam Stockard, opinion editor; Tim Davison, senior editor/digital and production; Michelle Russell, office manager; and Robert Sokalski, community member."

\
The Tennessee Valley Authority was created to harness the power of the Tennessee River and has invested the most money in its nuclear power plants.
\
But the majority of the electricity generated by America's biggest government utility comes from burning coal, which is igniting a political firestorm this year.
\
Changing political and global climates -- spurred, in part, by environmental problems at TVA's own coal plants -- are threatening some of the workhorses in the power stable of the federal utility. Coal may be TVA's most abundant and reliable power source, but it faces its biggest environmental challenge this year since TVA erected its first fossil plant 60 years ago in Johnsonville, Tenn.
\
New regulations from Congress, EPA and the federal courts could double the cost of TVA's coal-fired generation within the next decade and also push up generating costs at the seven coal power plants in Georgia operated by the Southern Co., according to utility officials and environmental regulators.
\
""Coal is our lowest cost and most abundant domestic energy resource for electricity production so it has been a mainstay of our generation for decades,"" TVA Chief Operating Office Bill McCollum said. ""Going forward though, there are a number of challenges that would indicate that the cost of coal generation is likely to be higher in the future.""
\
Unless TVA replaces its coal plants or consumers learn to use less power, average monthly electric bills could rise by more than $100 by 2020.
\
Mr. McCollum said energy production from fossil fuels faces a triple threat:
\
* A federal judge ordered TVA this year to install more than $1 billion of additional pollution controls at four of its coal plants.
\
* Congress is debating limits on carbon and mercury emissions from coal plants.
\
* EPA is writing new rules to require better handling of coal ash.
\
Complying with the each of the new rules likely will add to the capital and operating costs of TVA's coal operations, Mr. McCollum said.
\
""It's not clear yet where those costs will wind up,"" he said. ""The future is always uncertain, but it's a lot more uncertain right now.""
\
Critics of coal contend that TVA needs to retire some of its aging fleet of 59 coal-fired boilers spread out over 11 plants in three states.
\
""Some of TVA's oldest, dirtiest and least efficient coal units should have been phased out years ago and replaced with renewable power,"" said Stephen Smith, executive director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and a former member of TVA's Regional Resource Stewardship Council.
\
Matt Landon, a volunteer leader of a 4-year-old group fighting coal usage in East Tennessee -- United Mountain Defense -- blames coal plants for much of Tennessee's air pollution.
\
""From the cradle to the grave, coal is dirty and destroys our environment,"" said Mr. Landon, who was arrested by TVA police in March for trespassing on the site of a major ash spill in Kingston.
\
REPAIR OR REPLACE?
\
In its 76-year history, TVA has shut down only one coal plant -- the former Watts Bar Steam Plant in Rhea County. But TVA officials said the agency is studying whether it still makes sense to maintain and upgrade its oldest plants, including units in Johnsonville and Widows Creek which already are senior citizen age.
\
A federal judge has ordered TVA to install scrubbers on the six oldest units at its Widows Creek Fossil Plant near Stevenson, Ala., within the next five years.
\
Tom Kilgore, TVA chief executive officer, said the agency is studying the costs of installing the court-ordered pollution controls. To recover such an investment, the units normally would be expected to operate for at least another two decades.
\
But with growing concerns about the long-term future of coal, TVA may not want to invest more in its oldest and smallest fossil units.
\
""By 2025, we will have coal facilities that will be 75 years old,"" Mr. McCollum said. ""While those coal facilities have added tremendous value in terms of keeping power prices low for people in the valley for many years, it's kind of hard to imagine someone at TVA operating those coal plants when they get a whole lot older.""
\
TVA has spent $5.1 billion on pollution controls for coal plants since the 1970s to cut its emissions of carbon and nitrogen oxides by more than 75 percent.
\
John Myers, TVA's senior manager for environmental strategy and management, said the agency plans to spend another $3.7 billion over the next decade to install more coal scrubbers and other pollution control equipment.
\
Last year, the rate of sulfur dioxide emissions by TVA coal plants was nearly 11 percent below the U.S. average, while nitrogen oxide emissions during the ozone season were more than 18 percent below the national average for the amount of power the plants generate, according to TVA figures.
\
NORTH CAROLINA LAWSUIT
\
Nonetheless, a lawsuit from neighboring North Carolina claims the smog from TVA's coal plants is a public nuisance to the Tar Heel State and soon could force even more costly pollution upgrades by TVA.
\
A federal judge ruled and later affirmed a judgment against TVA this year that requires the utility to expedite installation of emission control equipment at four coal-fired plants. Most costly and challenging for TVA is the order for coal scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction devices at the John Sevier Fossil Plant near Rogersville and the Widows Creek.
\
TVA, which is challenging the ruling, contends it can't meet the schedule for installing scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction devices on its John Sevier plant without shutting down the plant for 20 months. TVA wants more time to make the upgrades.
\
""We've spent a lot to clean up the air and we're going to continue to spend a lot,"" Mr. Kilgore said. ""We have set a goal of getting at least 50 percent of our power from noncarbon sources (nuclear, hydro and renewable sources) by 2020.""
\
CARBON CHALLENGES
\
But that may not be enough if the U.S. Senate goes along with a U.S. House-passed cap on carbons adopted Friday.
\
By a vote of 219-212, the House adopted legislation to require the United States to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels. In the decade from 1998 to 2007, carbon dioxide emissions from TVA plants grew by more than 15 percent.
\
The House measure would require TVA and other utilities to use more renewable energy sources and, if unable to meet lower carbon emissions itself, buy carbon credits on an open market under the proposed cap-and-trade system.
\
Mr. Smith and other environmental leaders complain that the measure is watered down from President Barack Obama's campaign pledge to cut carbon emissions by 25 percent by 2025.
\
""Our analysis suggests that this bill would not help America make any progress towards that goal, at least through 2020,"" he wrote in recent blog.
\
But TVA officials said the measure will encourage the utility to look to energy sources other than coal in the future. Coal industry backers hope a method of carbon sequestration can be developed to bury carbon dioxide emission in underground caves and limit the greenhouse gases spewing from coal plants.
\
TVA has no plans to build any more coal plants, but it also has not defined any schedule for shutting down any existing coal units.
\
Over the next 18 months, TVA will develop a new Integrated Resource Plan to help the TVA board evaluate future energy options, Mr. Kilgore said.
\
COMPARING COSTS
\
The operating costs of electricity generation by TVA:
\
* Existing coal: 2.5 to 3.5 cent per kwh
\
* Nuclear: 2 cents per kwh
\
* Hydroelectric: 0.5 to 0.8 cents per kwh
\
* Renewable fuels: 5 to 30 cents per kwh

Critics of coal contend that TVA needs to retire some of its aging fleet of 59 coal-fired boilers spread out over 11 plants in three states.
\
""Some of TVA's oldest, dirtiest and least efficient coal units should have been phased out years ago and replaced with renewable power,"" said Stephen Smith, executive director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and a former member of TVA's Regional Resource Stewardship Council.
\
Matt Landon, a volunteer leader of a 4-year-old group fighting coal usage in East Tennessee -- United Mountain Defense -- blames coal plants for much of Tennessee's air pollution.
\
""From the cradle to the grave, coal is dirty and destroys our environment,"" said Mr. Landon, who was arrested by TVA police in March for trespassing on the site of a major ash spill in Kingston.
\
REPAIR OR REPLACE?
\
In its 76-year history, TVA has shut down only one coal plant -- the former Watts Bar Steam Plant in Rhea County. But TVA officials said the agency also is studying whether it still makes sense to maintain and upgrade its oldest plants, including units in Johnsonville and Widows Creek which already are senior citizen age.
\
A federal judge has ordered TVA to install scrubbers on the six oldest units at its Widows Creek Fossil Plant near Stevenson, Ala., within the next five years.
\
Tom Kilgore, TVA chief executive officer, said the agency is studying the costs of installing the court-ordered pollution controls. To recover such an investment, the units normally would be expected to operate for at least another two decades.
\
But with growing concerns about the long-term future of coal, TVA may not want to invest more in its oldest and smallest fossil units.
\
""By 2025, we will have coal facilities that will be 75 years old,"" Mr. McCollum said. ""While those coal facilities have added tremendous value in terms of keeping power prices low for people in the valley for many years, it's kind of hard to imagine someone at TVA operating those coal plants when they get a whole lot older.""
\
TVA has spent $5.1 billion on pollution controls for coal plants since the 1970s to cut its emissions of carbon and nitrogen oxides by more than 75 percent.
\
John Myers, TVA's senior manager for environmental strategy and management, said the agency plans to spend another $3.7 billion over the next decade to install more coal scrubbers and other pollution control equipment.
\
Last year, the rate of sulfur dioxide emissions by TVA coal plants was nearly 11 percent below the U.S. average, while nitrogen oxide emissions during the ozone season were more than 18 percent below the national average for the amount of power the plants generate, according to TVA figures.
\
NORTH CAROLINA LAWSUIT
\
Nonetheless, a lawsuit from neighboring North Carolina claims the smog from TVA's coal plants is a public nuisance to the Tar Heel state and soon could force even more costly pollution upgrades by TVA.
\
A federal judge ruled and later affirmed a judgment against TVA this year that requires the utility to expedite installation of emission control equipment at four coal-fired plants. Most costly and challenging for TVA is the order for coal scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction devices at the John Sevier Fossil Plant near Rogersville and the Widows Creek.
\
TVA, which is challenging the ruling, contends it can't meet the schedule for installing scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction devices on its John Sevier plant without shutting down the plant for 20 months. TVA wants more time to make the upgrades.
\
""We've spent a lot to clean up the air and we're going to continue to spend a lot,"" Mr. Kilgore said. ""We have set a goal of getting at least 50 percent of our power from noncarbon sources (nuclear, hydro and renewable sources) by 2020.""
\
CARBON CHALLENGES
\
But that may not be enough if the U.S. Senate goes along with a U.S. House-passed cap on carbons adopted Friday (or Saturday).
\
The U.S. House voted xxxxx to adopt a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions linked with global warming by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. To do that, the legislative proposal will require utilities to use more renewable energy and create a cap-and-trade system, in which polluters would be required to accrue buyable, sellable credits for all the greenhouse gases they produce.
\
Mr. Smith and other environmental leaders complain that the measure is watered down from President Barack Obama's campaign pledge to cut carbon emissions by 25 percent by 2025.
\
""Our analysis suggests that this bill would not help America make any progress towards that goal, at least through 2020,"" he wrote in recent blog.
\
But TVA officials said the measure will encourage the utility to look to energy sources other than coal in the future. Coal industry backers hope a method of carbon sequestration can be developed to bury carbon dioxide emission in underground caves and limit the greenhouse gases spewing from coal plants.
\
TVA has no plans to build any more coal plants, but it also has not defined any schedule for shutting down any existing coal units.
\
Over the next 18 months, TVA will develop a new Integrated Resource Plan to help the TVA board evaluate future energy options.

43,"Bush owns full blame for Iraq disaster\To the Editor:\I believe Charles Krauthammer's column, ""Iraqi culture, not U.S., is at fault,"" Nov. 18, is another attempt to shift blame for the Iraq disaster away from where it belongs -- the Bush administration.\***\First, it was the media's fault not finding good news in Iraq. Then, Cindy Sheehan demoralized the troops. Then, it was those few ""bad apples"" at Abu Ghraib. Now, the Iraqi people are to blame.\No, this buck stops with George W. Bush, who single-mindedly chose to remove a dictator who was the only stabilizing force holding Iraq together, despite warnings from many Middle East experts.\Bush's father, George H. W. Bush, warned our troops would be, ""an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land.""\Krauthammer offers ""not shooting looters"" and ""not taking out"" the Mahdi Army as our key mistakes. Would killing more Iraqis have made them trust us instead of their mosque, clan or militia?\The mistake was Bush allowing former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to refuse the originally requested 300,000 troops, intended to prevent looting and militias before they could start.\Krauthammer doesn't mention that the first improvised explosive device (IED) roadside bomb went off 72 hours after Bush allowed -- against the advice of commanders on the ground -- Paul Bremer to fire the surrendered Iraqi army.\Regardless, to use Colin Powell's ""Pottery Barn"" analogy; we not only own this broken pot, we own the entire trashed store Iraq has become.\Blaming the Iraqi people won't change that.\Joe Irrera\Nashville 37214\joe.irrera@comcast.net\There is truth\in political comics\To the Editor:\With regard to the letter, ""Comics page no place for political cartoons,"" Nov. 20, political cartoons definitely belong on the comic pages.\There is much truth in political cartooning as well as much cynical, satirical and stinging, humorous remarks.\In these sad and hypocritical times, we need not less humor but more. I can't tell you how often I laugh just to keep from crying.\George Bushulen\Nashville 37206\Westin would be\great for downtown\To the Editor:\I couldn't agree more with The Tennessean's editorial on the proposed Westin Hotel for Lower Broadway. I have been heartened by the community's outspoken support for this project over the past few weeks, and am excited about what final approval by the Metro Council would mean for Nashville. (""Build hotel tower on Lower Broadway,"" Nov. 17)\A Westin Hotel on Lower Broadway would not only be a sound economic and environmental investment in our city -- it would also help bring to life a severely underutilized block that has so much potential.\The Metro Planning Department's recently unveiled plan for downtown Nashville looks to achieve a dynamic downtown community that stays active beyond the 9-to-5 workday, and the Westin Hotel, with its condominium units, retail space and entertainment venues, would be a strong step in that direction.\I love the unique character of downtown Nashville, and would be even prouder to show it off to out-of-town visitors with a development like the Westin on Lower Broadway.\Jane Ferrell\Nashville 37205\theferrellsare@comcast.net\NCLB has started\to show good results\To the Editor:\According to your newspaper, Susan Ohanian, an educator, has a plan to stop ""No Child Left Behind."" What will she replace it with? The same old system which for 40 years has failed more students than the previous year? (""NCLB critic a hit with teachers,"" Nov. 19)\For as long as my 46 years can remember, the experts were saying the school system has been slipping in quality of education. For that 46 years there has been a parade of politicians who have told us they were going to fix schools.\No one did until President Bush came along. He produced a plan in response to the wishes of the people. Amazing how people will say, ""Do something,"" without giving guidance, only to complain about the fix.\Schools across our state have started showing positive results because of ""No Child Left Behind.""\Susan Ohanian said ""No Child Left Behind"" was not funded. That is why we need to stop the program. Maybe the $8,000 per student that we have been paying for was funding enough.\Maybe her group has another agenda and would rather bash Bush than teach. This system has started to show results.\This is one time that staying the course would be a good idea.\Wesley Witten\Smyrna 37167\Global warming\isn't a left-wing idea\To the Editor:\I would like to commend The Tennessean for its recent editorials regarding global warming and the reality of its effects.\The scientific community has moved well beyond the possibility of two sides to this issue; the findings are conclusive that the accelerated warming we are experiencing is unprecedented in recorded history and are already delivering consequences that touch us all.\In the context of our recent elections, I am hopeful that our policymakers will recognize their constituents' demand for a healthy, sustainable environment and vote without fear to address this country's harmful practices. Voters indicated nationwide that ""business as usual"" is no longer acceptable. With the new balance of power in our state and in Washington, D.C., the time is prime to address climate change in a bipartisan manner that makes sense for the environment and for the economy.\This issue of global warming is too often misconstrued as a left-wing issue only radicals could embrace. In reality, the answer to combating global warming relies on the business sector in a way that allows for even more economic growth. Market-based solutions like cap and trade -- already at work in Europe -- will actually open up new markets and revenue streams for farmers, manufacturers, bankers and others within the American economy.\Thank you again for your dedication to issues that matter.\Lindsay Craig\Nashville 37209\Global warming\is just media hype\To the Editor:\Global warming, now conveniently called climate change to better suit the data, has just as many opponents as it has proponents. The United Nations wants the United States to ratify the Kyoto Treaty so as to wreak havoc on our economy.\Don't put on your hard hats -- the sky is not falling. The concept of global warming/climate change is media hype that cannot stand up to the scrutiny because of old, insufficient data.\Steve Moore\Cookeville 38501\Having income tax\isn't good answer\To the Editor:\It amuses me to hear the comments of people like letter writer Matt Hooper (""Elvis is dead; income tax issue far from it,"" Nov. 18) and his friends at the Tennesseans for Fair Taxation.\If they are so naive to believe that instituting a state income tax will be a long-term replacement for the sales tax, then I have some swamp land in Louisiana that I'd like to sell them.\Any alleviation in the sales tax would only be temporary, and eventually all working Tennesseans would be saddled with both forms of taxation.\Did I mention that the swamp land is under water?\Mike Young\Nashville 37221\DUI sensors in cars\could have defects\To the Editor:\The proposal to install breathalyzers in all cars with a kill switch to prevent operation really got my attention. (""DUI fight moves toward alcohol sensors in all cars,"" Nov. 20)\First, there is no excuse for requiring teetotaler motorists to pay for such a device.\Second, to suggest that it would be similar to air bags is totally false because releasing an airbag accidentally does not disable the car. And there have been numerous recalls for airbags that deploy improperly.\Our inclination to sue someone for whatever really turns me off, but I'm sure that I would be looking for a lawyer if my car were disabled by a defective sensor when I was driving my wife to the hospital. And it would seem appropriate to include MADD in the proceedings.\Bob Strobel\Hendersonville 37075\ONLINE EXTRA\'Ziploc security'\keeps Americans safe\To the Editor:\The letter, ""Ziploc security is nonsense,"" Nov. 22, is proof that TSA should add an IQ test to security procedures. No, we have not experienced ""a massive number of deaths from liquid explosives,"" but only because of the hard work and perseverance of foreign and domestic security forces.\Letter writer Sheri Reynolds seems oblivious to the confirmed, coordinated attempt in London several months ago. Last I heard, several suspected terrorists were in jail because they were in the implementation stage of using liquid explosives to cause a ""massive number of deaths.""\No, we have not had ""multiple shoe-bomb disasters,"" but we have at least one acknowledged attempt that was thwarted by the courage and action of passengers in flight.\Personally, I am on a plane at least once every week, and must deal with security procedures in Nashville and elsewhere. Of course, none of us enjoy taking our shoes off every time we pass through security. Purchasing special travel-size liquids and placing them in a separate Ziploc bag is certainly a nuisance. Alternatively, checking your bag adds time to both the start and end of a trip. While the procedures at security can be time-consuming, the rules are extremely clear (check the TSA Web site), and they are in place for our own safety. In addition, I have found the TSA personnel to be extremely friendly, patient and helpful in the process.\To anyone who complains about the security process, I remind you -- I'm not sure how you could forget -- that thousands of people have indeed died as a result of criminal acts made easier by inadequate security procedures. So, if the nuisance of removing your shoes, placing your liquids in a Ziploc bag, or checking your bags is simply unbearable, please explore driving, taking the bus or walking.\Terry Shirey\Nashville 37205\Learn history before\enacting English-only\To the Editor:\The fall of Rome occurred because it could not raise an army; the people no longer believed in the idea of Rome (""History demonstrates need for dominant language,"" Nov. 19)\After hundreds of years of corruption and abuse, the people did want to fight for Rome. For centuries Rome flourished with a multitude of languages, diversity of people and ideals. Revisionists would have us believe that Rome only allowed one language, one culture. Rome was not only bilingual; it was multilingual. Before we pass English first, we should learn history first.\Or we will repeat the same mistakes.\Mario Ramos\Nashville 37023\mario@mrvisa.com"

Voters' message should be clear
\
I hope voters of Virginia and New Jersey sent a message to the rest of the country and Americans' love affair with its socialist president is now at least slightly shaken.
\
After 10 months in office, he has managed to put the country in the largest deficit in its history, has demonstrated his inability to act on sending additional troops to confront our enemies, and made overtures which were rebuffed by Iran and North Korea.
\
While tramping around the globe (and the country), Mr. Obama never passed up the opportunity to apologize for America, which is a disgrace.
\
Unemployment, which his administration insisted would never exceed 8 percent, now stands at 10.2 percent, and the recovery he touted exists only in his mind. He's done nothing to effectively stimulate the economy and create jobs, other than jobs created in the government sector.
\
His cap-and-trade proposal and health care reform will further impact American small business that has been the engine of our economy for over 200 years.
\
When was the country last in such dire straits? Think Jimmy Carter. But then again, now Carter won't go down in history as our country's worst president, and for that he should thank Mr. Obama.

Improve the home to aid education
\
It is impressive that Bill Frist and others are directing the SCORE initiative to improve education in Tennessee. The ""solutions"" mentioned -- data study, strong leadership, improved teaching and higher standards -- are arguably incrementally effective and have been in play for a while. Schools are full of well-trained professionals (go visit one if you don't believe this) who stay on top of teaching and research trends, and will do virtually anything to help kids succeed.
\
Tennessee's schools are not failing the students (except that perhaps there needs to be more technical high schools with different graduation requirements). The real truth is that, despite school improvements, socioeconomic problems seem to have increased even faster, and almost any educational professional will tell you that dropping out and failing is strongly tied to socioeconomic characteristics of student's home lives.
\
Poverty is by far the major affector, but other powerful influences include divorce, crime, neglect or abuse, substance abuse, teen pregnancy and adherence to aberrant subcultural norms that do not value respect for others or education nor instill a work ethic. The most important step in helping young people succeed in school is to improve the home environments of children.

Time for leaders to stop hypocrisy
\
Hard times are everywhere. Republican state Rep. Glen Casada said it is time to look at cutting the per diem pay of state legislators.
\
Republican U.S. Congressman Zach Wamp said it is time to impose term limits on Congress.
\
This staunch Democrat agrees with both ideas. I think it is time for our leaders to put their mouths where their money is; cut through the hypocrisy and do the right thing.
\
They can begin in the state House of Representatives by phasing out their pension plans. Retirement pensions should be reserved for full-time workers.
\
Congress almost enacted term limits several years ago. With all the notorious lawbreakers this august body of lawmakers has produced lately, is there any doubt that we could attract a better quality legislator with term limits?
\
Gubernatorial candidates can do their part, too; give the voters your position on the issues. Ward Cammack is the only one who has taken the time to do this. And would it be asking too much for just one out of the 10 candidates for governor to campaign for a State Bank of Tennessee if he or she gets elected?

Correct injustice on discrimination
\
Congress is currently considering the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. This will make it illegal to fire someone for simply being lesbian, gay or transgendered. Statistically, there is only a small chance that this even applies to you, the reader.
\
The hardest part in gaining equal rights for a minority group is relying on the majority to care enough to correct the injustice. Believe it or not, they're your average looking neighbors, your friend at work, that person in the grocery store or at the post office. Sometimes they're even part of your family.
\
They simply want to live without fear of being fired from their jobs.
\
Federal law protects workers against discrimination based on race, gender, religion, etc., but not based on sexual orientation.
\
In 29 states, it's legal to fire otherwise-qualified employees because they are lesbian, gay or bisexual.
\
ENDA ensures that employees are judged for their performance, not for who they are.
\
So please, give this some thought. Whether you believe that being gay is right or wrong, you must believe that it is wrong to fire someone from a job for no other reason than who they are in love with and choose to spend their lives with.
\

The article (Nov. 7) by Jacqueline Koch regarding a shooting at an area park is obviously just a fabrication. Everyone knows the wise municipal fathers have banned guns from such venues, therefore no such shooting could possibly have occurred. Only a low-life criminal would even consider violating such an edict from on high. The Times Free Press should be ashamed to publish such a blatant impossibility.

Leaders pit groups against each other
\
After watching with angst the debate in Congress regarding health care, I finally heard one lone congressman say the magical words that pierced the magic bubble of liberalism. I paraphrase: ""With government overseeing, we can curb people's lifestyle habits regarding smoking and food intake."" Do you see the pattern here?
\
People are so disenfranchised with American politics because of this very mentality. Politicians pit one group of people against another in the name of what's good for us to distract us from what's wrong in Washington. Washington can tax premiums of insurance policies, cut Medicare, tax sweets and cigarettes and still not have utopia as they see it.
\
All they will accomplish is more animosity among us while they slide in the back door and steal our civil liberties and squander our money. The groups to pit against each other are us, our money and the inept, bankrupt federal government.

45,"A Senate vote this week on mercury emissions was a victory for the Bush administration and a loss for the environment.\The Senate defeated 51-47 a resolution to void rules imposed in March by the Environmental Protection Agency. Those rules called for reductions in mercury emissions but are far too weak. They allow for a cap-and-trade system where polluters can buy credits from other plants that are below allowable levels of mercury. The EPA guidelines come with a national cap and a ceiling for each state, but the system leaves ""hot spots"" of mercury pollution where public health is at stake. Mercury especially can cause serious neurological harm to young children. Because of the location of plants and emissions blown in from elsewhere, Tennessee is vulnerable.\Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander was one of nine Republicans who voted with 37 Democrats and one independent in favor of the measure sponsored by Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vt., and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. It is sad that Sen. Bill Frist was not as willing to stand up for principle on this health issue as his state colleague.\Opponents of the Senate resolution said it would cost too much to make the crackdown on mercury tougher. So they buckled to the power industry. Their position is an acknowledgement, however, that technology exists to curb dangerous mercury pollutants. So the ability is there, just not the will.\This isn't the first time the Bush administration has dealt the nation a bad hand on an important environmental issue. But it is disheartening to see members of the Senate, who should know better, go along with the administration's misguided strategy. The nation will suffer from the decision. o"
46,"Fresh start on clean air bill\One way to clear the air in America would be to destroy the myth that partisanship kills environmental legislation.\Last week, a bill based on President Bush's Clear Skies Initiative was killed by a tie vote in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The voting, however, wasn't strictly on party lines. And outside the committee, all kinds of bipartisan cooperation on clean air is under way in the Senate.\The White House bill sets caps on emissions. It also expands the ""cap and trade"" policy, which allows industries to buy and sell the right to exceed pollution caps. Yet the bill has drawn fire for not pushing limits aggressively, for allowing mercury pollution to be traded and for not covering carbon-dioxide emissions.\Sen. Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I., joined Democrats on the committee in opposing the legislation. He and Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., have a bill that moves more quickly than the president's to cut emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is a Republican who has joined them.\Independent Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont has an even stricter bill with sponsors like Sens. Joe Lieberman, a Democrat, and Susan Collins, a Republican, signed on.\That bipartisan commitment was on full display in Tennessee last week when two former U.S. senators from the state addressed a conference on air quality in Knoxville. Both former Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Howard Baker hailed the cross-party cooperation that created the clean air act in the first place. Baker, a Republican, and Sen. Ed Muskie, a Democrat, drafted that first bill, as Gore recalled.\Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist should recognize this state's leadership's long tradition of cooperation across party lines that has scorned expedient solutions and produced worthy legislation. Without it, Americans can't begin to clear the air."
47,"nbeadle@jacksonsun.com\Roger Moore tries to decode clues found in pits of clay to West Tennessee's distant past.\What he has found so far, he argues, counters the widely held belief that carbon dioxide is a principal cause of global warming.\Moore, a 58-year-old paleoclimatologist who lives in Milan, presented his research at the North American Paleontological Convention at the University of Cincinnati on June 22. He said the conference went well and he met others doing similar work.\Moore has an undergraduate and master's degree from University of Tennessee Martin and a Ph.D. in paleontology from Mahasarakham University in Thailand.\For four years he studied the structure of fossilized leaves found in clay pits in Henry County and western Kentucky, comparing them to leaves from the plants' modern relatives in Florida.\Moore said the fossils are essentially long records of what the environment surrounding the plant was like.\Common scientific thought on global warming blames the phenomenon on the increased presence of greenhouse gases, which trap heat and thus raise temperatures. A principal greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, which is emitted from cars, power plants and other human activity.\Based on his research, Moore argues that carbon dioxide levels shown by the fossils do not appear to be much higher than they are now.\""It certainly can't explain subtropical conditions in Tennessee"" in the far past, Moore said. ""It would take much, much higher concentrations of (carbon dioxide) to create a greenhouse situation. ... So there is some other explanation out there.""\He said there could be a wide variety of explanations, such as cyclical increases and decreases in the intensity of solar radiation or potentially that the Earth cycles through heating and cooling periods.\Moore, a former businessman who entered science as a second career, said his argument confronts whether new regulations that could have a profound economic and personal impact on Americans' lives are needed to reduce carbon dioxide.\Last week, the U.S. House narrowly passed ""cap-and-trade"" legislation that would limit emissions while allowing companies to trade allowances on pollution.\Such legislation is supported by President Barack Obama and, if it becomes law, could result in higher prices for fuel and electricity. Republicans have labeled it a national energy tax.\""Do we have a valid reason to even be worrying about (carbon dioxide) based on modern readings and modern outputs?"" he asked.\Moore noted that he does not try to date his fossils, calling typical methods of divining the age of ancient objects as ""myth,"" but said they could be as much as 38 to 40 million years old.\He also is concerned about the meteorological effects of increased carbon dioxide and whether it could play a role in drought.\""Is there a (carbon dioxide) level that's out there that can cause rainfall changes?"" Moore asked. ""I can't address it too much. That's where, when you publish a paper, it says, 'This requires additional study.'""\Those interested in learning more about Moore's research can contact him by e-mail at paleo1moore@gmail.com.\Visit jacksonsun.com and share your thoughts.\- Nicholas Beadle, 425-9763"
48,"
It is not the intention of Americans to send any of our U.S. jobs to India or Communist China. But if we're not careful, we may do that.
\
We've heard of ""cheap labor"" in some foreign countries. But in this case, the problem is not payrolls but carbon dioxide.
\
President Ed Feulner of the highly respected, independent, Washington-based Heritage Foundation, warns us that last year, the Environmental Protection Agency issued an ""Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking"" that could have a tremendously negative effect on American jobs. It involves regulation of carbon dioxide emissions.
\
Did we say ""regulation""? Mr. Feulner notes that in 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide may be considered a pollutant as defined by the Clean Air Act. The notice of EPA rule-making and its supporting documents runs to 18,000 pages! How's that for ""regulation""?
\
""CO2, of course, is a naturally-occurring gas,"" Mr. Feulner reminded in a recent column. ""It's produced whenever a person breathes and, yes, whenever we use any sort of fossil fuel. Driving a car, mowing a lawn, boiling a cup of water, even flipping on a light switch (thus using electricity generated in CO2-emitting power plants) produces carbon dioxide.""
\
All of this is of current interest because we don't want any increase in ""greenhouse gases"" that might adversely affect our environment.
\
But what about affecting our economy?
\
""A study last year from The Heritage Foundation predicted CO2 regulations could cost up to 800,000 jobs per year in some years,"" Mr. Feulner noted. ""Even in a 'good' year, our economy could lose more than half a million jobs every year from 2015 through 2026. (These are net job losses, by the way. The Heritage estimate takes into account all the 'green' jobs the government is supposedly going to create, and still shows hundreds of thousands of lost jobs each year.)""
\
The result of excessively strict anti-CO2 regulations could put as many as 3 million people out of work, Mr. Feulner observes: ""That's because business owners, faced with a massive carbon tax, would pack up and move their plants to China, India or some other location where the government doesn't impose exorbitant costs.""
\
Mr. Feulner explains, ""As Heritage energy expert Ben Lieberman testified before Congress, the trouble starts as soon as the (cap and trade) bill's provisions take effect in 2012. 'For a household of four, energy costs go up $436 that year, and they eventually reach $1,241 in 2035 and average $829 annually over that span. Electricity costs go up 90 percent by 2035, gasoline by 58 percent, and natural gas by 55 percent by 2035. The cumulative higher energy costs for a family of four by then will be nearly $20,000.' ""
\
It should be obvious that we do not want to permit hazardous or otherwise harmful emissions. But we also do not want to rush in, with less than clear and definite information, to unwise actions that would do drastically harmful things to our economy and our way of life.
\
We obviously need to be sure of our science, be aware of the economic consequences, and develop practical ways to reduce and avoid any really damaging emissions -- all without ruining our American economy and American way of life, while Communist China and India increase objectionable emissions.

This state's major cities look filthy and backward in the report.\The good news, however, is it doesn't take long to figure out exactly why Tennessee's major cities score so poorly on carbon emissions, and in many cases it is already known what has to be done to correct the problem. The issue now is to what degree this state and the rest of the country will have the will to do the right things on environmental issues.\A report by the Brookings Institution, including analysis from the Southern Environmental Law Center, recently found that all four of Tennessee's major urban areas have some of the largest carbon footprints in the country.\In the list of 100 largest city areas, Nashville ranked sixth in the nation among the worst carbon emitters. Knoxville ranked as 10th worst, Chattanooga 13th and Memphis 24th. The list made Tennessee the state with more metropolitan areas with a significant carbon footprint than any other state. Further, the study showed that Southern cities tend to have the worst numbers on emissions. The worst in the nation was Lexington, Ky.\The results might leave the impression that the density of population causes the amount of carbon emitted. But the study proved differently, finding that cities in the South had more carbon intensity than New York, Chicago or Los Angeles. When you look at the characteristics of the Southern cities in the report, a major telltale sign emerges: sprawl. Nashville certainly knows sprawl.\The study looked at emissions from cars, trucks and residential energy consumption. Tennessee is especially prone to score poorly by those measures. An abundance of interstate highway traffic, including many heavy trucks, can be found, and there is very little mass transit. The South is known for urban areas where commuters travel extensively from locations outlying the urban core. And the region has seen enormous population growth in recent years. Southerners burn a lot of gas, and they use a lot of energy in their homes' heating and cooling units. The South has benefited for decades in terms of low-price energy, but time has shown that the environmental cost of using coal-fired power plants is high.\The question becomes what to do about carbon emissions, but it's not as though nobody knows. In fact, it's well known what would help. The most immediate answer is mass transit. People are beginning to warm to mass transit as a personal economic option as a way to hold down fuel bills. It happens to also be a smart environmental move.\Another factor that doesn't get enough attention is the need to move more freight from trucks onto trains. Strategists are looking at efficient ways of using containers on rail lines to alleviate the heavy reliance on long-distance trucking. That raises issues of whether enough rail exists to handle the volume.\The statistics that put Southern cities among the worst polluters are painful to digest, but there is reason to be optimistic. Not so long ago, it was difficult to get many policy makers even to believe that greenhouse gases are a problem. Currently, more people are acknowledging the problem and focusing on how to tackle it. So progress is being seen.\Congress failed this month to pass a bill on global warming designed to establish a cap-and-trade system on emissions. There are signs that that bill will come back next year. In time, carbon emissions can be dramatically reduced. Such solutions are at least in sight, in great part because so many people understand the issues now, genuinely care about the environment and want to solve the matter. That should be cause for encouragement, frustrating though these issues have been."
50,"President Barack Obama seems intent on going it alone these days. Whether it's NSA surveillance programs, patently unconstitutional recess appointments (which will soon go before the Supreme Court) or an executive order unilaterally implementing the DREAM Act, the president seems increasingly hell-bent on using presidential power to avoid consulting with Congress or the public.\A new entry was added to that list Tuesday, when Mr. Obama delivered a speech at Georgetown University, announcing that he is ordering the Environmental Protection Agency to craft rules that regulate carbon emissions from coal power plants. While the details of the plan remain murky, it's clear that the costs of the new regulation will be onerous - particularly to existing plants that will have to undergo costly retrofitting. As is inevitably the case with such regulatory exercises, those costs will end up being pushed onto consumers. They will also, of course, bleed the coal industry of jobs.\Any hopes that the administration's approach may be temperate are quickly dispelled by the memory of Mr. Obama, as a candidate in 2008, pledging to create an environment in which coal power - the nation's leading and cheapest source of electricity - is made so expensive that producers are driven into bankruptcy.\It bears remembering that this administration previously attempted such a sweeping reordering of the nation's energy production with the cap-and-trade bill it vigorously promoted during the president's first few years in office. The potential costs of that plan were so oppressive (the equivalent of a 15 percent tax hike, according to the Treasury Department) that it failed to win public favor or pass out of a Congress controlled entirely by Obama's Democratic allies. Most politicians would have regarded that result as a stop sign. For Mr. Obama, it apparently indicated only a detour.\Despite glib assurances by the president and his ideological allies that climate change is a potentially apocalyptic menace, the reality is decidedly more complex. In order to make the case for aggressive action, one must make a series of increasingly specific contentions: that global warming is occurring; that its effects are unambiguously baleful; that it is, at least in part, man-made; that there are government actions that can reverse its course; and that the benefits of those actions outweigh the costs.\If President Obama believes each of those assertions, he should make the case to Congress and the nation, not just a friendly audience on a college campus. If, as in the past, he fails, so be it. A fundamental reordering of the nation's economy cannot be undertaken simply as a matter of executive prerogative. The logic of governing a democracy has to be something more sophisticated than ""because I said so.""\- Orange County (Calif.) Register\ID_Code: DA-306270003"
51,"The giant tire maker Bridgestone announced Wednesday it plans to donate nearly 6,000 acres of forested land it owns in Middle Tennessee to a nonprofit conservation group.\The site, about 80 miles east of Nashville in White County, will be managed as a protected nature reserve and potential carbon bank by the Nature Conservancy.\Noted for its biodiversity, the land on the Cumberland Plateau is home to rare species like the peregrine falcon, Eastern slender glass lizard and barking tree frog. The reserve will also be used to protect and restore the shortleaf pine tree, which has been lost in the region to logging. Company and conservancy officials are calling the land the Bridgestone Nature Reserve at Chestnut Mountain, named after the area's highest peak.\It is the largest gift in the 40-year history of the Nature Conservancy in Tennessee.\""The Cumberland Plateau is one of those iconic regions in the state that we've identified as critically important for conservation,"" said Terry Cook, state director for the Nature Conservancy in Tennessee. ""We're honored they're trusting us with the future of this property.""\The Nature Conservancy plans to sell carbon credits on the site to companies participating in the voluntary carbon offset market. In these markets, companies measure the environmental impact of their operations — from coal burned to generate electricity at office buildings, for instance — and determine how much greenhouse gas emissions would have to be ""offset"" to make up for the impact.\In the case of a forest, offsets take the form of avoiding deforestation. When forests are burned or cleared, large amounts of carbon are released into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.\The Nature Conservancy will preserve enough forest on the land to offset, over decades, 90,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions associated with Bridgestone America's new 30-story office tower in downtown Nashville. Bridgestone is voluntarily taking this step as part of its corporate social responsibility initiative, company officials say, and is not being compelled to do so. Some states and other countries have a mandated ""cap and trade"" market system.\""We think it's important for us to walk the walk,"" said Chris Karbowiak, the chief administrative officer for Bridgestone Americas. ""We needed to make sure this property is preserved for generations to come.""\Setting aside trees equivalent to 90,000 tons of carbon is one of the deed restrictions with the land transfer, said Cook from the Nature Conservancy. The organization, and any future land owners, will also be prohibited from building any new roads, subdividing the property, erecting any new buildings, developing a landfill, or injecting fluid into the ground.\The Nature Conservancy will be allowed, however, to sell some of the trees to logging operators. They plan to follow harvesting guidelines set by the nonprofit Forest Stewardship Council. Land managers will likely replant cleared areas with shortleaf pine, Cook said.\Through logging and selling of carbon credits, the group hopes to defer costs associated with managing the land. Any leftover proceeds could be used to buy more land on the Cumberland Plateau, Cook said.\The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation will monitor the property to ensure it's preserved. Also, the state has been in talks with Nature Conservancy and Bridgestone officials about opening some of the preserve to public access. It could have hiking trails, primitive campsites, and some limited horse trails, Cook said.\Located near the town of Sparta, the land was purchased in the 1970s by Firestone, one of the predecessors of Bridgestone. Along with 10,000 adjacent acres, it was meant to be used for employee retreats and as investment property. But the land sat mostly unused for decades. Today, there's a small conference facility on site that is maintained by a caretaker and his small crew. They also oversee forest maintenance.\Bridgestone gave the other 10,000 acres to the state in two sections — some in 1998 and 2000. It's now managed as the Bridgestone-Firestone Centennial Wilderness Wildlife Management Area.\Reach Mike Reicher at 615-259-8228 and on Twitter @mreicher."
52,"Whether Gov. Haslam's reluctance to expand TennCare under Affordable Care Act is due to fear of political backlash, or a genuine inability to chart a clear course of action, it is creating a costly financial burden for Tennesseans as indicated by The Jackson Sun's daily statistical ""Misery Meter.""\A potentially workable alternative should be actively considered. A suitable model would be the plan currently being considered in Virginia, tentatively labeled ""Marketplace Virginia,"" which is similar to the private option approach taken in Arkansas.\Under this plan, the state would subsidize private insurance premiums using the $2 billion annually from the federal government initially offered for expanding Medicaid.\Haslam, in rejecting the government program, has consistently said he believes Tennessee can do better. Our neighboring states appear to have moved from dialogue to action in seeking to provide the best possible health care for the uninsured segment of the population.\With coverage for as many as 300,000 citizens of Tennessee hanging in the balance, it is time for Haslam and the General Assembly to stop procrastinating and get something accomplished.\Roger J. Schomburg\Savannah\Constituents should take note of Fincher accepting corporate farm welfare\I read with great interest Carley Appleton's recent letter to the editor concerning the hypocrisy of Congressman Stephen Fincher. Fincher's hypocrisy has been a topic of national news for some time now.\My father was a small farmer (and there are still a few out there) so I understand the importance of subsidies to farmers. However, when these large subsidy payments are being made to a United States representative, his constituents should take notice. The blatant hypocrisy of Fincher's action --- voting to cut welfare dollars for folks who need them most while personally accepting government welfare dollars in the form of farm subsidies --- is remarkable.\I've read many books about the Civil War over the years, and one particular fact has struck me as fascinating. During slavery, the majority of poor white people roundly supported the rich, white slave owners, even though they had nothing in common with them. It seems like not much has changed. Working and non-working poor and middle-class people, who have absolutely nothing in common with corporate business or rich business owners, often vote as if they did.\It also is worth noting again that religious beliefs have no place in politics, nor should an individual cast his or her vote assuming a candidate is a Christian. A truly Christ-like person will do the right thing in both his personal life and in business matters. You can't legislate morality. We should know that by now.\Lesia Rushing\Collierville\Democrats are the cause of do nothing Congress\In his State of the Union address, President Obama said he would work around Congress, if necessary, to accomplish all the wonderful things he wants to do for us. This is hardly late-breaking news. He has been working around Congress in every way possible since first taking office, using executive orders and Environment Protection Agency regulations. When even a Democrat-controlled House and Senate couldn't stomach his cap-and-trade proposal, he used EPA regulations to implement parts of it, and more of the same is coming this year. Obama declared his intention to keep fossil fuel and coal-fired utilities as expensive as possible, and that's promise he has kept.\As to the inaction of Congress, Sen. Harry Reid has refused to bring dozens of House-passed bills up for a Senate vote, to allow his Democratic colleagues in the Senate to avoid taking stands that might irk their constituents. Do nothing Congress, thy name is Harry Reid, and thy mentor is Barack Obama.\Perry Boling\Humboldt"
53,"By SCOTT BRODEN SBRODEN@DNJ.COM\-- Scott Broden, 615-278-5158\U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, an ardent opponent of the federal government's $787 million stimulus plan, told business professionals Wednesday that Americans will get through the economic crisis by making ""a shared sacrifice.""\""We will get it right,"" Corker said. ""Our best days lie ahead.""\A Republican from Chattanooga, Corker traveled to Murfreesboro to speak at a Rutherford County Chamber of Commerce lunch at Stones River Country Club. He also appeared at a function in Columbia later on where he addressed concerned General Motors workers and others about the future of the Spring Hill GM plant.\The Tennessee senator told the Murfreesboro audience he's concerned about children and grandchildren having to pay back what will end up being a $1 trillion debt when interest is counted.\Although some in Tennessee may benefit from a $4.2 billion cut of the stimulus package, Corker believes the legislation doesn't do enough to address the financial and housing issues that sparked the crisis.\""It's not going to fix the problem,"" Corker said.\Audience member Lee Moss, chief executive officer and chairman for Murfreesboro based Mid-South Bank, agreed.\""We're trying to solve the symptoms vs. the core issues,"" Moss said. ""Ultimately, until we find ways to provide adequate incentives to home buyers, we won't get the economy jumpstarted because it has to start with housing.""\Moss noted that the large banks are being careful with the loans to meet the requirements of federal regulators.\""I'd love to see Congress and regulators on the same page,"" Moss said.\Corker said part of the problem is that America's four largest banks are hoarding loans from Congress and former President George W. Bush. These institutions -- Bank of America, Citibank, Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan -- are hoping to stay afloat, but their reluctance to make the money available to others is hurting the economy, added Corker, who serves on the Senate's banking committee.\Audience member David Edwards, a Murfreesboro City Council member and a vice president and commercial lender at Middle Tennessee-based Pinnacle Financial Partners, agreed that these banks, which hold 38 percent of all assets in the country, are making it difficult for the financial market because of the bad debts they've taken on.\""They have to be very judicial,"" said Edwards, noting how negative consequences occur when major banks hoard money. ""It's a bit of a Catch-22.""\Corker also discussed his concerns about General Motors and Chrysler wanting more money from Congress and the president without taking steps to streamline costs.\""The only way for these companies to be successful is for shared sacrifice,"" said Corker, noting that the unions, managers and shareholders must be willing to accept cuts.\The senator also said he opposes a proposed ""Employee Free Choice"" bill that promotes unions recruiting enough new members to establish collecting bargaining power.\""To even call it that is crazy,"" said Corker, who'd rather keep the employee secret ballot process to determine if a factory or office will have union representation.\If unions can pressure employees to join, this will cause a major change in the balance of power between management and labor, Corker said.\""I'm fearful about what might happen,"" he said. ""It would set our country back decades.""\Corker also said he opposes a confusing cap and trade proposal being placed on carbon emissions from businesses in an effort to protect the environment.\""What it really is, is a tax on you,"" said Corker, noting the higher energy costs will be passed onto consumers at the gas pump or through their electric bills.\The senator instead favors a more transparent carbon tax that the government can't collect for revenues and must ""send every penny back to the American people."""

\
In December, the nations of the world agreed once again to do nothing about climate change.
\
And just as the science of climate change is clearer than ever, so too, are the politics: Whether led by President George W. Bush or Barack Obama, the United States is thwarting meaningful action on climate change. As people around the world lose faith in the U.S. government, it's long past time for individual Americans to think rationally -- about both science and economics. It's time to act with compassion toward those whose lives are already being affected by climate change.
\
Following the closing of the United Nations climate talks in Cancún, Mexico, I shared an airport shuttle with a woman from South Africa. Delegates from every country except Bolivia had just agreed again to delay action on everything from carbon emissions reductions to funding adaptation projects in developing countries, where the impacts of climate change are most severe. She's disappointed: ""They agreed last night that they were pleased to be going home,"" she said.
\
Adapting to climate change isn't about saving the environment, she says. It's about economics and survival. But the American people tell their leaders not to act, she says. In a democracy, after all, elected leaders carry out the wishes of citizens.
\
That wasn't the first conversation I had in Cancún with someone baffled by U.S. behavior. Time and again, whether riding the bus, standing in security lines or eating dinner, I met people from across the world who asked me what is happening in America.
\
They do not understand why the U.S. government has for 20 years challenged a binding international agreement to cut carbon emissions, mitigate the impacts of climate change and help developing nations deal with drought, rising seas, or floods that destroy infrastructure. Despite the actions of my government, I try to explain that many Americans do care about climate change.
\
States like California are trying to lower greenhouse gas emissions and create incentives that help both businesses and regulators by reducing emissions and boosting the clean energy economy. A new rule in New Mexico ensures that soon the state's polluters will have to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by three percent a year from 2010 levels. And the state approved a separate proposal paving the way for participating in a cap-and-trade plan under which 11 states and Canadian provinces have agreed to establish a regional, market-based emission reduction program.
\
In November, eight municipalities -- Boston, Cambridge, Grand Rapids, Florida's Lee County, Flagstaff, Miami-Dade, San Francisco and Tucson -- received funding from a nonprofit organization to participate in a program to help local governments prepare for climate-change impacts that already are occurring. Four states have statewide action plans to deal with climate change; others are studying its impacts and economic consequences.
\
In the United States, the significant action on climate change -- whether state laws mandating the use of renewable energy or municipal improvements to public transportation systems and bike routes -- is happening at a local level. But it's not nearly enough. Citizens need to urge the federal government to act. And we each have work to do within our own lives.
\
Most of the people I met in Cancún have already accepted that the U.S. government will never lead on climate change. But they still wonder why the American people fall for the histrionics of industry-funded climate change deniers when the science of climate change is clear. They are waiting for Americans to pay attention to the rising seas, the Amazon's burning forests and the glaciers melting from mountains across the globe. They are waiting for citizens to demand that the United States become a responsible member of the international community.
\
But they're not going to wait for long. That became painfully clear to me as I headed toward the airport with the South African passenger.
\
""Everyone used to want to be like America,"" she said. ""I think that is not the case anymore.""

55,"Staff Writer\Sen. Lamar Alexander is pushing a plan for Congress to reinstate - at least temporarily - a rule a federal court shot down in July that called for reducing emissions at coal-fired plants in\28 states.\""The more we've learned about the impact of sulfur and fine particles on people with asthma and respiratory disease, the more concern there is,"" Alexander said. ""We want to send a signal to TVA and other utilities to stay on the path.""\He and Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, held a roundtable discussion last week with a few representatives of environmental groups, industry and states to look at options Congress might consider for such legislation.\The Clean Air Interstate Rule, nullified by a U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., had intended to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide beginning in 2009 and sulfur dioxide in 2010.\The first of those chemical compounds is a building block for lung-irritating ozone; the second results in acid rain, haze and tiny airborne particles.\The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had estimated that the rule, intended to deal with the pollution that wafts across state lines in the eastern portion of the country, would prevent 17,000 premature deaths by 2015.\TVA was among the electric utilities in the process of adding controls to cut its emissions to meet the law. Officials at the federal agency, which provides electricity throughout Tennessee and parts of six other states, have said they intend to continue.\""We're very committed to the program we've already started, which is basically what our CAIR plan is,"" Barbara Martocci, a TVA spokeswoman, said Tuesday. ""We're going to move forward.""\Under the interstate clean air plan, TVA plants with nitrogen oxide controls would use them year-round, not just in the warm months when ozone forms and spikes in the presence of sunlight.\That will begin next month, Martocci said. Scrubbers will begin operation in December to make the Bull Run plant cleaner and in 2010 at the Kingston plant and 2012 at John Sevier, all plants in East Tennessee, she said.\The state of North Carolina, which sued in 2006 to make TVA reduce its emissions that drift into and through the Great Smoky Mountains, has\questioned the agency's resolve without legal requirements.\The lawsuit charges that pollution from TVA plants makes residents ill, causes deaths, damages the environment and harms tourism in North Carolina.\TVA officials deny the contentions.\Both parties filed final documents on Monday in the lawsuit. It's up to U.S. District Judge Lacy Thornburg to decide.\'A path forward'\Vickie Patton, deputy general counsel of the national Environmental Defense Fund, said Alexander and Carper's plan would be ""a path forward for protecting our kids' health.""\Power companies could get ""certainty so that they can roll up their sleeves and begin planning to make investments in a way that protects human health while maximizing efficiencies and minimizing costs,"" said Patton, who took part in last week's meeting.\""If we're thoughtful about protecting human health and putting in place sensible policies, we can help address the burden of high gas costs on American families by pioneering new plug-in technologies for our cars.""\The discussion included not just reinstating part of the interstate clean air rule, but making it a temporary bridge while law is strengthened and expanded to include reductions of the neurotoxin mercury, which can end up in waterways and fish, and carbon, which adds to global warming.\Both are released by coal-fired power plants.\The same district court in Washington had in February vacated an EPA rule to limit mercury through a cap-and-trade program.\Congress urged to act\Counties and cities are in a bind trying to meet tightened air quality standards, and congressional action could benefit all, Alexander said.\""I don't know how they can meet standards if utilities aren't required to do this,"" he said.\""If we're going to use coal, which we have to, it's got to be clean coal. It's 60 percent of all our electricity today and is with us for the foreseeable future.""\Bob Tuke, a Nashville attorney who is Alexander's Democratic opponent in the November election for U.S. Senate, said a stop-gap rule is needed but said what disappoints him is that Alexander hasn't done more before this.\He said Alexander has undermined environmental policies by siding repeatedly with the Bush administration. Alexander has consistently opposed tax credits for wind technology, which could help provide cleaner energy.\""We need to look at the air quality altogether,"" Tuke said.\Contact Anne Paine at 615-259-8071 or apaine@tennessean.com."
56,"The slow march to socialism in Washington has become an all-out dash.\In an effort to befuddle and bedazzle the American people, we have been subjected to endless comparisons to the Great Depression while they offer up the government as the only solution to all of our ills. The reality is, of course, this recession is not nearly as bad as the recession of 1982, and we all made it through that one just fine.\What makes this recession so different is the unprecedented response from the government. This ""stimulus"" package that's being foisted upon this country grows by the day. We now know that this bill contains mountains of pork; everything from $550 million for contraception to $150 million for honeybee insurance. To put it in perspective, this stimulus package is larger than the gross domestic product of Australia.\While we watch the looters trying to persuade us to break out the checkbook, they're trying to slip their slimy hands into our back pockets. One example is the cap-and-trade scheme coming out of the U.S. Senate. Barbara Boxer, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, is pushing for a carbon offset program for businesses. Industries would be limited to a certain amount of carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide is, of course, the harmless gas that we all exhale and plants use it to make oxygen. Instead of capping true pollution, Boxer and her colleagues are proposing capping CO2. Any company that went above the limits would have to buy offsets from companies that aren't over the limit. It's a way to redistribute corporate wealth. It makes as much sense as sin offsets or trash offsets. You can sin as much as you want or throw as much trash out the window as you like, as long as you pay someone else who's not doing it. It's a money grab, plain and simple.\Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., is proposing an alternative. He favors a carbon tax. This is where these same industries that go over the CO2 limit would pay a tax to the government. The government, ostensibly, would issue rebates to consumers who are directly affected by that particular industry raising its prices. Corker's heart is in the right place. He truly believes the Senate will pass something and he'd rather it be a tax that comes back to the people. But, there's a third option. Oppose it all!\I suggested to Sen. Corker that he point out that the earth has actually been cooling since 1998 and that a growing number of scientists are now changing their minds about manmade global warming. Corker doesn't want to fight them on the science; he wants to fight them on policy. But the science is what really matters.\Retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John Theon has now come out as a skeptic. Theon was James Hansen's boss at NASA. Hansen, of course, is the father of all this global-warming hysteria. Theon now admits that Hansen ""embarrassed NASA"" with all of his wild claims. Theon says, ""Climate models are useless. Thus, there is no rational justification for using climate model forecasts to determine public policy."" Yet, that's exactly what Boxer and the global-warming alarmists in Congress are doing.\I couldn't get an answer out of his office as to whether Corker believes in all this global-warming claptrap. If he doesn't, I can't see how creating a new tax on something that is, at best, inconclusive, is constructive.\It all comes down to a fundamental difference in principles. Either you believe the government is the solution to all of our economic woes, or you believe in the free market. Either you believe this global-warming nonsense, or you don't. There comes a time when our elected officials must vote based on their principles. These are not issues of compromise. These are issues where people of principle show us what they're made of. We're counting on the conservatives left in Washington to stop this socialist steamroller.

57,"By Chuck Raasch\TENNESSEAN WASHINGTON BUREAU\WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama told wealthy donors in Florida on Monday that his critics have a ""selective memory"" about what he has accomplished in his first nine months in office.\The president took credit for pulling the economy back from ""the brink of a meltdown,"" citing a $787 billion economic stimulus package that he said has resulted in the largest investments in energy, research and education in history, and the biggest spending on infrastructure since the interstate highway construction of the 1950s.\""Not only did we steer the economy away from potential catastrophe,"" he told donors at Miami's Fontainebleau Hotel, ""but we also laid the groundwork now for making sure that our kids are going to be able to compete in an international, global marketplace.""\The president may be correct in claiming his critics have political amnesia. But unemployment -- which may be the most important barometer of the 2010 elections -- keeps inching up toward 10 percent, with economists predicting it will stay there for some time.\And a year after he was elected president, Obama still faces five challenges that, cumulatively, are no less significant than what confronted him in January:\* The economy. While Obama argues that taxpayers pulled banks and Wall Street back from a financial precipice, concerns over unemployment and government deficits have ballooned. In Florida, unemployment has topped 11 percent.\In polls, Obama is getting mixed marks on the economy so far. The public does not share his belief that the bailout has worked. Some of the more controversial government actions of the last year -- primarily the bailout of big banks and automakers -- began under his predecessor, George W. Bush. But the longer Obama is in office, the more those issues become his.\""Only about one in three people believe the stimulus has helped the economy, so there is not a great sense that that has saved things,"" said pollster Scott Rasmussen, who surveys public attitudes daily. ""People also have overwhelming resentment toward the bailouts and the takeover of the auto companies, and would undo those in a second.""\* Health care. The president is correct in saying Congress is closer to reforming the nation's health system than at any time in recent memory. But there remain substantial obstacles to passage of something that meets his goals of cheaper, more widespread coverage.\Some think a plan announced Monday by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that would give states the right to opt out of a so-called government-run ""public"" health insurance option might pass, but it's not clear whether moderate Democrats and Republicans will support it.\Some liberals have been upset that Obama has not stood more steadfastly behind a public option. More than any other issue, the prolonged health-care debate has exposed tensions between liberals and centrists in the Democratic Party.\* The environment. The administration's push to tax polluters, central in ""cap and trade"" legislation, has been overshadowed by the health care debate. It's also drawn concentrated opposition from business and industry, whose leaders say any tax increases would devastate a reeling economy.\Public opinion on the legislation is split. The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press reports a significant drop in the number of Americans who say there is solid evidence that global temperatures are rising, from 44 percent in April 2008 to 35 percent in a poll taken Sept. 30-Oct. 4. Pew's Andrew Kohut said he suspects that part of the drop is due to the public's overwhelming focus on economic worries.\* Afghanistan. The commanding general in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, has asked for tens of thousands more troops to defeat the Taliban and stabilize the country. Obama has balked, and critics say his unwillingness to push forward with the request puts troops at risk and makes the U.S. look indecisive in a war that Obama himself has said the U.S. must win.\Recent polls show the country split almost in half on whether to send more troops.\So no matter what Obama ultimately decides, half the country will be against it. Anti-war liberals are watching this decision closely to see whether this president will confront them on a vital war-and-peace question.\""Independents and Democrats as well are pretty edgy about Afghanistan,"" Kohut said.\Obama may have gotten a boost last week when NATO ministers endorsed more troops and aid for Afghanistan.\* The political climate. Despite campaign pleas to get beyond the politics of divide and conquer, Obama has largely abandoned that peace offering. His emissaries have fiercely attacked Fox News as an arm of the Republican Party, gone after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in the health-care debate, and depicted Republicans as ""the party of no"" almost since he came into office.\Obama ""has made some progress (on economic issues), but as long as we are close to 10 percent unemployment and people are worried about spending and things like that, you are not going to get a big turnaround,"" Kohut said.\Contact Raasch at craasch@gannett.com, follow him at http://twitter.com/craasch or join in the conversation at http://www.facebook.com/raaschcolumn)"

(Her peers) must be impressed with her.""\According to Nolan, because about half of Tennessee's congressional delegation has never held political office, Black's political prowess may serve her well.\""She knows the drill of how a legislative body works,"" he said.\The Ways and Means Committee has jurisdiction over taxation, tariffs and other revenue-raising measures as well Social Security, unemployment benefits, Medicare, enforcement of child support laws and foster care and adoption programs. All bills regarding taxation must first go through this committee.\Black will join the ranks of eight U.S. presidents - two of which, Andrew Jackson and James K. Polk, hailed from Middle Tennessee - and eight vice presidents who have served on that committee. Recently retired U.S. Rep. John Tanner formerly represented Tennessee on the committee.\Black says the privilege of being chosen as only one of two incoming freshmen for the committee will enable her to work on keeping her campaign promises of decreasing spending and creating a job-friendly environment.\""We need to stop borrowing money and putting our children into debt,"" she said.\""Businesses have told me they are not growing because there is so much uncertainty there with additional taxes with cap and trade and additional expenses with health care. The government is not giving assurances that there's stability, and they want that.""\A registered nurse, Black was elected to Tennessee's House of Representatives in 1998 to represent Hendersonville and Gallatin. Six years later she defeated Jo Ann Graves for the 18th District seat in the state Senate.\Perhaps the closest race of her career came in the August Republican primary for Bart Gordon's seat when she defeated her closest opponent, Lou Ann Zelenik, by a single percentage point. Gordon announced his retirement after 25 years in the U.S. House in December 2009.\Black is one of 13 women who will be sworn in today.

There is much in the House cap-and-trade energy bill that just passed that I absolutely hate. It is too weak in key areas and way too complicated in others. A simple, straightforward carbon tax would have made much more sense than this Rube Goldberg contraption. It is pathetic that we couldn't do better. It is appalling that so much had to be given away to polluters. It stinks. It's a mess. I detest it.
\
Now let's get it passed in the Senate and make it law.
\
Why? Because, for all its flaws, this bill is the first comprehensive attempt by America to mitigate climate change by putting a price on carbon emissions. Rejecting this bill would have been read in the world as America voting against the reality and urgency of climate change and would have undermined clean energy initiatives everywhere.
\
More important, my gut tells me that if the U.S. government puts a price on carbon, even a weak one, it will usher in a new mind-set among consumers, investors, farmers, innovators and entrepreneurs that in time will make a big difference -- much like the first warnings that cigarettes could cause cancer. The morning after that warning no one ever looked at smoking the same again.
\
Ditto if this bill passes. Henceforth, every investment decision made in America -- about how homes are built, products manufactured or electricity generated -- will look for the least-cost low-carbon option. And weaving carbon emissions into every business decision will drive innovation and deployment of clean technologies to a new level and make energy efficiency much more affordable. That ain't beanbag.
\
Now that the bill is heading for the Senate, though, we must, ideally, try to improve it, but, at a minimum, guard against diluting it any further. To do that we need the help of the three parties most responsible for how weak the bill already is: the Republican Party, President Barack Obama and We the People.
\
This bill is not weak because its framers, Reps. Henry Waxman and Ed Markey, wanted it this way. ""They had to make the compromises they did,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, ""because almost every House Republican voted against the bill and did nothing to try to improve it. So to get it passed, they needed every coal-state Democrat, and that meant they had to water it down to bring them on board.""
\
What are Republicans thinking? It is not as if they put forward a different strategy, like a carbon tax. Does the GOP want to be the party of sex scandals and polluters or does it want to be a partner in helping America dominate the next great global industry: ET -- energy technology? How could Republicans become so anti-environment, just when the country is going green?
\
Historically speaking, ""Republicans can claim as much credit for America's environmental leadership as Democrats,"" noted Glenn Prickett, senior vice president at Conservation International. ""The two greatest environmental presidents in American history were Teddy Roosevelt, who created our national park system, and Richard Nixon, whose administration gave us the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency."" The elder George Bush signed the 1993 Rio Treaty, to preserve biodiversity.
\
Yes, this bill's goal of reducing U.S. carbon emissions to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 is nowhere near what science tells us we need to mitigate climate change. But it also contains significant provisions to prevent new buildings from becoming energy hogs, to make our appliances the most energy efficient in the world and to help preserve forests in places like the Amazon.
\
We need Republicans who believe in fiscal conservatism and conservation joining this legislation in the Senate. We want a bill that transforms the whole country not one that just threads a political needle. I hope they start listening to green Republicans like Dick Lugar, George Shultz and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
\
I also hope we will hear more from Obama. Something feels very calculating in how he has approached this bill, as if he doesn't quite want to get his hands dirty, as if he is ready to twist arms in private, but not so much that if the bill goes down he will get tarnished. That is no way to fight this war. He is going to have to mobilize the whole country to pressure the Senate -- by educating Americans, with speech after speech, about the opportunities and necessities of a serious climate/energy bill. If he is not ready to risk failure by going all out, failure will be the most likely result.
\
And then there is We the People. Attention all young Americans: Your climate future is being decided right now in the cloakrooms of the Capitol, where the coal lobby holds huge sway. You want to make a difference? Then get out of Facebook and into somebody's face. Get a million people on the Washington Mall calling for a price on carbon. That will get the Senate's attention. Play hardball or don't play at all.

"
60,"
The Tennessee Valley Authority says it may cost $800 million to clean up the coal ash spill at its Kingston power plant. Burning coal to make electricity is a major reason East Tennessee has unhealthful air. And coal-fired power plants produce 40 percent of the carbon that America contributes to climate change.
\
So why burn coal?
\
In his inaugural address, President Barack Obama said, ""We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories."" Such renewable power will make a contribution, but here are several reasons why we will be using coal -- cleaner coal -- to make electricity for the foreseeable future.
\
First, we need a lot of electricity and we have plenty of coal. The United States uses 25 percent of all the world's electricity, and coal produces half of what we use. (It produces 60 percent of what we use in the TVA region). ""Renewable energy"" from wind, solar and geothermal sources produces 3 percent. According to TVA, an independent study estimates that if we put giant wind turbines on the maximum number of ridges in the TVA region, it would still produce only about 3 percent of the electricity customers need.
\
Second, the United States is the Saudi Arabia of coal. We don't have to import it from unfriendly nations that might hold us hostage.
\
Third, electricity from coal is much cheaper than energy from the wind and sun. That matters, for example, to the 10 percent of Nashville Electric Service customers who said in December they could not afford to pay their electric bills even with TVA's relatively low rates. It matters to Volkswagen and its suppliers when they decide whether to put jobs in Chattanooga -- or in some other state, or overseas.
\
Fourth, coal is reliable. Coal plants can operate almost all the time. On the other hand, the wind blows only when it wants to -- about one-third of the time nationally, and less in the TVA region.
\
Fifth, it takes large amounts of low-cost, reliable electricity to produce renewable energy of the kind we hope we can rely on more in the future. For example, the new billion-dollar plant making solar power materials in Clarksville -- like the new solar plant announced recently for Bradley County -- needs 120 megawatts to operate. This is one-fourth the production of a typical coal plant.
\
Finally, we already know how to burn coal cleanly -- with the exception of carbon. TVA has done a good job of getting rid of nitrogen pollutants but is just getting started on sulfur and mercury. There is a proven technique to recapture carbon and store carbon underground, but that is not yet, and may never be, a commercially viable method for most coal plants.
\
Nevertheless, the National Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group, supports coal plants if carbon is recaptured because coal burned cleanly will help the United States and other countries move more rapidly to deal with climate change.
\
Former Vice President Al Gore says recapturing carbon from coal plants is ""too imaginary to make a difference."" I disagree. I believe we are more likely to recapture carbon from coal burning than we are to operate our huge economy on the wind, sun and heat from the Earth.
\
So how do we act boldly to increase energy independence, provide more jobs and deal with climate change?
\
* Full speed ahead on conservation and efficiency. TVA customers lead the country in using the most electricity per capita, which means we waste a lot.
\
* Build more nuclear power, which today produces 70 percent of all U.S. carbon-free electricity.
\
* Convert half our cars and trucks to electric power over 20 years. This will reduce carbon and cut by one-third the billions of dollars we send overseas to buy foreign oil. We can do this without building one new power plant if we plug in at night when demand is low.
\
* Find more natural gas and oil. New supplies of natural gas will keep manufacturing jobs from going overseas and will keep residential heating and cooling prices affordable. Even if we electrify half of our vehicles, we should be using our own oil for the other half instead of sending billions overseas.
\
* Put pollution-control equipment on all coal plants.
\
* Double federal spending for energy research and development in order to launch four ""mini Manhattan projects"" to figure out how to recapture carbon from coal burning, make solar power cost-competitive with coal, reprocess waste from nuclear plants so it can be more easily stored, and make advanced biofuels from crops we do not eat.
\
* Put carbon caps on coal-fired power plants and fuel. Capping power-plant smokestacks and vehicle tailpipes (and giving all revenue gained from this back to those who pay higher energy prices) will limit 70 percent of carbon emissions, avoid capping or limiting small business and manufacturing, and cost much less than an economy-wide ""cap and trade"" program.
\
This agenda is comparable to President John F. Kennedy's challenge that we land a man on the moon in 10 years: It's one we can accomplish. On the other hand, an agenda that relies mostly on renewable energy anytime soon, as President Obama proposes, would be as unrealistic as it would have been for President Kennedy to propose that we land a man on Mars in 10 years.

Headline creates a false impression
\
If the results of a national poll showed that 20 percent of respondents believe that the earth is flat, would your story have begun with the headline ""Is the Earth flat?""
\
Somehow, I doubt it. That issue was settled a long time ago.
\
Yet, that's essentially what you did in reporting on a poll that showed that a surprising number of people believe that President Obama is a Muslim, which, of course, he isn't.
\
When your newspaper writes a headline, ""Is Obama Muslim?"" all it does is create the impression that the issue isn't settled, that there might be some hard evidence that indeed President Obama might actually be a Muslim. And that feeds into the well-honed Republican strategy of trying to paint the president as something other than a ""real"" American.
\
The subhead -- ""Locals say move on to more pressing issues"" -- adds more fuel to the fire by suggesting that even if Obama is a Muslim, it's really not worth talking about.
\
While the story was reasonably well balanced and straightforward, the headline was misleading and created a false impression.

There's good news on comics front
\
There was good news and more good news in Executive Editor J. Todd Foster's column this Sunday. The first good news was that the comic strip ""Cathy"" is being canceled by its writer. The second good news was that ""Pickles"" will be its replacement. ""Pickles"" is a good choice. I predict ""Pickles"" will soon be one of the Chattanooga Times Free Press readers' favorite daily comic strips.
\
The editorials in the Times Free Press usually discuss peripheral issues like education, politics and environment. Only occasionally will an editorial stray into more vital topics. Sunday's column was one of those important commentaries. After all, what captures the public's attention more than the comics page?
\
We all want our local paper to achieve greatness. In that spirit, I'm nominating my choices for the ""bottom four"" comics -- four inane and unfunny candidates that I hope the editors will not wait for their writers to cancel: ""Pearls Before Swine,"" ""Pooch Cafe,"" ""Get Fuzzy"" and ""Mother Goose & Grimm."" I hope other readers will join me in commenting on this worthwhile effort.

Volunteers' aid a touching display
\
I worked with about 100-150 other volunteers helping the college freshmen move into the dorms at UTC one day last week. Having plenty of time to think, as the job at hand was 99 percent physical labor, I decided that much of society is about self and about the stuff that self has or can accumulate.
\
But as I worked, I thought about the people who were there. Many I knew and many I did not know, but as everyone got engaged in the job at hand and as the day progressed, three of the workers stood out to me enough for me to write about.
\
The first one was David Barker, who took the day off from his established medical practice. Who knows how much money he did not make that day? His wife, Mary, was also involved in the task; therefore their three young children had to stay with their grandmother.
\
Also, young Megan Ayres handled a two-wheeler all day that was taller than she was, up and down the stairs. She hardly spoke at all, never complained.
\
All I can say is what hearts these young people have for their fellow man and how they touched this old man's heart.

Keep conservatism under golden dome
\
Voters in Georgia have two clear choices in the November gubernatorial election. One, Roy Barnes is a liberal Democrat, fired by the voters eight years ago, who would be at home with Obama and his cohorts. The other, Nathan Deal, is a conservative Republican, very highly rated by the American Conservative Union (ACU.)
\
Federal Election Commission (FEC) receipts show Barnes has donated $5,800 to Obama's election campaigns since 2004. He has directly assisted the radical leftist to office. In addition, Barnes gave $4,800 to Friends for Harry Reid last year. Reid was one of the prime movers, as Senate majority leader, in passing ObamaCare.
\
Mr. Deal, during his 17 years of service in Congress, attained a lifetime rating by ACU of 90 for his conservative votes. This included voting against ObamaCare; to extend elimination of the estate tax (death tax) through 2011; and against cap and trade, which would greatly increase electricity bills.
\
In addition, Deal has an A-plus lifetime rating by numbersusa.com for his work to reduce illegal immigration. He introduced legislation years ago to eliminate birthright citizenship for children born to illegal aliens.
\
Georgia voters should elect Nathan Deal to keep conservatism under the golden dome.
\
Remember in November.

End Muslim immigration
\
Muslims and Muslim hijackers are a greater threat to the U.S. than illegal immigration. Like Australia and New Zealand, who have recognized the threat to their countries, we too must end Muslim immigration. Why?
\
First, because Muslims hate Christians and Jews in the same murderous way Hitler hated the Jews. Further, Muslims do not integrate into societies other than their own. And hating democracy, they insist on Sharia law.
\
The Quran teaches that those who do not convert to Islam should be killed. Read the foreign press! Islam approves of lying to further its cause. Muslim men are permitted to beat their wives and children and to stone women caught in adultery, while men go free.
\
Islam has infiltrated every facet of American society, our Secret Service agencies included, with the purpose of subjugating us in the same manner they have cowed Europe into silence.
\
I urge all to write to Gov. Bredesen to end Muslim immigration into Tennessee, specifically to not allow mosques to be built, because they are not just places of prayer, but they teach hatred for America and are used to hide radical jihadists.

Chill out over global warming
\
After shoveling 3 inches of ""global warming"" off my driveway Saturday, I was heartened to read Dr. Gary Gill Bible's carefully reasoned, factually supported column (""Cooling the rhetoric,"" Jan. 31) challenging the prevailing global warming consensus.
\
I'm not a scientist, but Dr. Bible's data seem to confirm that weather and climate go through cycles; if we wait long enough, they will change again.
\
The unequivocal, herd-like mentality within much of the scientific and political communities would have us believe global warming claims are irrefutable. A few decades ago, ""experts"" in those same communities voiced fears of global cooling. Remember the subzero temperatures that refrigerated much of the nation in 1977 and 1978?
\
The Feb. 1 newspaper confirmed we just had the area's biggest snow since the famous '93 blizzard. Record subfreezing temperatures and snowfalls have hit many parts of the world. For global warmers, is this ""an inconvenient cold""?
\
As stewards of this place called Earth, we should value the environment and do all we can to avoid polluting it -- because it's the right thing to do. At the same time, a ceasefire to unequivocal, politically correct assertions of global warming would be welcome. Chill out, people!

It is Sunday, Jan. 31. I was at home on Lookout Mountain. I was warm and life is good. The power was on and the streets were passable.

This actually happens every day because we are fortunate to have, in our small community, government that works. We elect fellow citizens and pay reasonable taxes that are used in a community that works.
\
It works because we have dedicated elected fellow citizens and wonderful city employees. We talk to each other and we respond to each other's needs. When we have disagreements, we discuss them in a fair and civil manner and respect each other's opinions. As a result, we live in a community that most of us believe can't be beaten.

Prepare students better for college
\
I have high admiration for Jack Murrah (current chairman of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission), who has made so many contributions to our community and our state. But his op-ed article in Tuesday's newspaper suggests that THEC may be part of the problem, not the solution.
\
Commenting on collaboration between Chattanooga State and UTC, he writes: ""The time has come to lay aside differences about standards and work for the greater good of students.""
\
I heard frequent complaints from faculty, when I formerly served as provost, that students who received A's in developmental math and English courses at community colleges could not pass college-level courses in those subjects at UTC. As a professor, I have seen it with my own eyes.
\
Mr. Murrah correctly identifies the goal as increasing degree production, not necessarily increasing graduation rates (they are not the same thing). We can do that by relaxing academic standards. But how would that work for the greater good of students? Surely we can find a better approach.
\
Perhaps we could start by asking why high school graduates are not prepared to do college-level work.

I hear reports that every man, woman and child in America owes $45,000. That is probably an average year's salary for many workers. Those who make more are fortunate.

63,"By SCOTT BRODEN SBRODEN@DNJ.COM\-- Scott Broden, 615-278-5158\The latest energy bills being debated in Congress will create or cost jobs and clean or damage the environment, depending on whom you ask.\U.S. Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Murfreesboro, believes the American Clean Energy and Security Act approved by the House will bring 4,479 new alternative energy jobs to his 6th Congressional District in Tennessee.\""This is more than a climate bill,"" said Gordon, chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology. ""This is an energy independence and jobs bill. We don't want to be hostage to foreign sources of energy.""\Republican U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, however, announced a new plan Monday that calls for building 100 nuclear power plants in 20 years instead of approving the House energy bill.\In an address at the National Press Club, Alexander described the House plan as the ""high-cost solution to clean energy and climate change,"" according to a news release from the senator's office.\""Its economy-wide cap-and-trade and renewable energy mandate is a job-killing, 100-billion-dollar-a-year national energy tax that will add a new utility bill to every American family budget. The House plan will raise utility bills and send jobs overseas looking for cheap energy. The Republican Senate plan will lower utility bills and create jobs,"" Alexander stated.\Gordon, though, sees the House legislation's goal of regulating and reducing carbon dioxide pollution as a way to create blue-collar jobs in renewable energy. It calls for a 17 percent reduction of emissions from 2005 levels by 2020, pushing America to invest in renewable energy such as solar and wind.\""This bill will help us produce more domestic sources of energy, so we won't have to be held hostage to OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and other cartels that continue to raise our gas prices,"" Gordon said.\Gordon's position is also being challenged by Bedford County Republican Dave Evans, who hopes to unseat the incumbent in the November 2010 election.\Evans said the Senate should reject what he calls the ""cap-and-tax bill"" because it will lead to job losses from businesses faced with higher fees and possible taxes for gas and electricity emissions.\""It will raise the energy rates in America, and that's passed onto the user, which could be business, small business, individuals,"" said Evans, a Wartrace resident.\The higher fees will be passed on to consumers or cause small businesses to shut down, added Evans, who is retiring as a major general from the U.S. Army Reserves after a 40-year military career.\To avoid higher energy costs, larger businesses might relocate operations to Mexico, Canada or overseas countries, added Evans, a Persian Gulf War veteran.\Evans said he supports exploring alternative energy but not regulations that will put America at a disadvantage with China, India and other emerging economies.\""We need to bring jobs back to America and not continue to see them relocate to where they do not have such stringent controls,"" said Evans, who bases his information from the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""We can achieve initiatives and work on having cleaner air without enacting legislation that further fuels the move of jobs to other countries.""\Evans noted that unemployment in the 6th District has reached 10.3 percent in Rutherford County and 15.7 percent in Marshall County.\""We know the people of Tennessee are hurting,"" said Evans, who was raised in a rural part of Putnam County near Cookeville. ""We need to look at bringing manufacturing jobs to America and certainly Middle Tennessee where we are being impacted so greatly. Let's not ignore the current needs of America.""\Evans questions the environmental motivation behind cap emissions legislation.\""There are many experts who don't think we are experiencing the global warming threat that Al Gore is warning against,"" Evans said. ""It will cost jobs here in Tennessee, and it will ultimately raise taxes to pay for it.""\Gordon acknowledges that the bill will raise energy bills, but mentions that a nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates it will cost the average American family $175 annually, or about $15 per month more, by 2020. The estimates do not include how utility companies can upgrade their energy grids or homeowners can take steps to make their homes and appliances more energy efficient.\The congressman suggested the bill can create jobs just as Nissan's plans to create 1,300 jobs to build electric cars and batteries in Smyrna will lead to 9,000 other supplier jobs.\Sen. Alexander, however, said in the news release that nuclear power is a way to address concerns about emissions without raising taxes or causing energy price increases.\Alexander said that while nuclear power produces only 20 percent of America's electricity, it produces 70 percent of carbon-free, pollution-free electricity. He said that 100 nuclear plants would double U.S. electricity production from nuclear power in 20 years, making it about 40 percent of all electricity production.\""Add 10 percent for sun and wind and other renewables, another 10 percent for hydroelectric, maybe 5 percent more for natural gas,"" the senator stated, ""and we begin to have a cheap as well as clean energy policy.""\""We should want an America in which we create hundreds of thousands of 'green jobs,' but not at the expense of destroying tens of millions of red, white and blue jobs,"" he added.\""In other words, it doesn't make any sense to employ people in the renewable energy sector if we are throwing them out of work in manufacturing and high tech. That's what will happen if these new technologies raise the price of electricity and send manufacturing and other energy-intensive industries overseas searching for cheap energy. We want clean, new, energy-efficient cars, but we want them built in Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, not Japan and Mexico.""\Evans also questioned whether Gordon and other members of the Democratic-controlled House rushed the legislation without studying it just as he said Congress did with the $787 billion stimulus funds earlier this year.\Leaders in Washington need to listen to voters, make sure legislation is right and learn about its ramifications before enacting it, Evans said.\""That would be responsible,"" he added\Gordon, though, said he and his staff did study more than 1,500 pages of the legislation before voting for it on June 22. This included a 300-page amendment that came out about 20 hours before passage.\""We read the entire bill and various sections more than once,"" said Gordon, a sixth-generation resident of this region. ""I'm certainly not going to do what I don't think is in the best interest of Middle Tennessee."""

""While that is disappointing, I do get the sense that my colleagues in the Senate HAVE learned a great deal over the past year, and for that reason, we have a far better chance to be able to work in a bipartisan fashion to implement good policies that will stand the test of time.""\Congressman Zach Wamp\WASHINGTON -- Congressman Zach Wamp issued a statement following President Barack Obama's State of the Union address:\""Since controlling the White House and Congress for the past year, the liberal Democrats in Washington, D.C., have increased the deficit by more than 300 percent to $1.4 trillion. Simply implementing a budget freeze measured against last year's record levels of spending will do little to curb the ballooning deficit. It is time to return to fiscal sanity.\""Our country can no longer accept these spending policies. House Democrats, in one year of reckless federal government spending, passed $787 billion in stimulus funds, two government spending bills totaling more than $855 billion and increased non-defense spending by 12 percent. This doesn't include all of their new spending priorities for 2010 or expanding entitlement programs that impose additional mandates on state and local governments.\""The Congressional Budget Office has released its projections that the United States will have a $6 trillion total budget deficit over the next decade. The Wall Street Journal described this $6 trillion aggregate debt as, 'a level that many economists worry is unsustainable in the long run, and could lead to a currency shock, inflation, crippling interest rates or other economic maladies.'\""The public rightfully has major concerns with the rapid growth of government. We should work to implement responsible policies that decrease our national debt and properly manage the entire federal budget, including mandatory and entitlement programs, and limit our debt in future years.""\Kerry Roberts, 6th District candidate\SPRINGFIELD -- Sixth District Congressional candidate and Certified Public Accountant Kerry Roberts issued the following statement after President Obama's State of the Union address:\""In President Obama's first year in office, his economic policies have resulted in increasing unemployment, unsustainable deficits, and record-breaking national debt. Tonight, in his State of the Union address President Obama promised to pass his healthcare plan, pass a jobs-creation bill, and make economic recovery his ""number one"" priority.\""As a CPA and small business owner, I know that you can't solve a spending problem with more spending or a debt problem with more debt. Our President needs to quit promising things he can't deliver and, instead of spending money he doesn't have, fight for lower taxes so the American people have the freedom to spend their money as they see fit. Having more money in our pockets will have an immediate impact on the families and small business owners in Middle Tennessee. We need jobs, not more government bureaucracies that waste our hard-earned dollars.""\State Sen. Jim Tracy, 6th District candidate\State Sen. Jim Tracy, R-Shelbyville, responded to President Obama's State of the Union address.\""The Obama Administration and Democrat controlled Congress are taking our country down a path of no return. Spending is out of control and government regulating our health care is not the answer. Tonight President Obama's words rang hollow. Congress needs to get back to the basics and use a good dose of common sense.""\Tracy is small business owner, former teacher and coach, and former TSSAA & NCAA basketball referee. He has been married to his wife, Trena, for 33 years, and they have three sons. Jim and Trena live in Shelbyville and attend Fairlane Church of Christ, where Tracy is an active member and Deacon. He is a 1978 graduate of The University of Tennessee Martin with a degree in Agriculture Education.\Lou Ann Zelenik, 6th District candidate\Lou Ann Zelenik, candidate for Congress in Tennessee's 6th Congressional District, reacted to President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech with the following statement:\""I was pleased to hear the president's emphasis on jobs this evening. In meeting with so many families and business owners across the 6th District, no issue carries more importance to Tennesseans than the lack of available jobs. Earlier this month, another 80 Tennessee families learned their source of income was closing in Smith County. Unfortunately career politicians are just now coming to the table to address this critical issue.\""While they are attempting to take over our health care, and impose job killing Cap and Trade legislation, there is real suffering out there that they rarely bother to see. While the politicians are late to the party on jobs, I am glad they have finally taken notice of the most critical issue in the 6th District.\""The president's proposals to freeze spending at 2010 levels might be a good headline but it will do little to create jobs in Tennessee. Just in the first nine months, Congress has borrowed more than in the last 30 years. As I have campaigned across our district since October, I have called for the unspent portions of the stimulus bill to be repealed and redirected to targeted tax cuts that will allow businesses in Tennessee to spend that money hire more people and give our economy the real boost it needs to get back on track."""

Riverbend language is a disappointment
\
As two loyal Riverbenders, we're always there come rain or shine, no matter the main stage star of the night.
\
We look forward to this week from year to year; so, imagine our surprise and disgust when the most anticipated (aka disappointing) star of the night on Thursday introduced a young friend of his, who turned out to be a rapper who uses X-rated words in his ""music."" We thought that all performers had been screened and advised that this is a family venue! We were told by friends later that some previous acts had been asked to leave the stage for this reason. So what happened? Were there no officials of the festival there that night?
\
Please! keep our festival the family event it has always been.

Cartoon confuses libertarian views
\
Clay Bennett's June 20 cartoon depicting a lifeguard letting swimmers drown because he's a libertarian is a poor analogy showing Mr. Bennett's misunderstanding of the libertarian philosophy of governance.
\
Libertarians are not anarchists desiring no government at all. Libertarians believe the government should protect the life, liberty and property of its citizens from threats such as murder, rape, theft, foreign invasion, etc. Therefore Bennett's libertarian lifeguard should be portrayed as vigorously saving the swimmers from drowning because that's the role of a lifeguard, just as libertarians believe government should do its job to protect citizens' basic liberties.
\
A socialist lifeguard, however, would spend his time on one side of the pool dictating who should and shouldn't be swimming the butterfly stroke while other swimmers drown behind him. After all, socialists in power bring government to do what it shouldn't be doing at the expense of what it should be doing.

Obama politics ruining lives
\
Well now, our president has his own Katrina! Despite his harsh and frequent criticism of President Bush as a result of his response to Katrina, this president has shown himself to be a failed leader!
\
I guess being a community organizer in Chicago didn't prepare him for organizing the federal government's efforts to help stop the oil leak in the Gulf, prevent permanent damage to the environment, or assist in clean-up of our Gulf shores.
\
The president is the leader of the country, and while he cannot be expected to be an expert in dealing with problems, he's expected to show leadership and assemble experts among the various government agencies, and the outside private sector as well. Obama has shown no leadership and instead has used this environmental disaster to push his ""cap and trade"" agenda. How shameful, and disappointing, most especially to the people of the Gulf Coast, whose lives are being ruined while he plays politics.
\
I saw a bumper sticker that said ""Had Enough? Vote Democratic."" It may be time to remove it now, rather than to continue to display ignorance in light of all that this president has done, and what he has failed to do to protect our country.

Action gives police a bad name

Concerning Saturday's front-page article about Aline Wright. Mrs. Wright was suffering stroke symptoms and her husband, Eric, drove her to the Erlanger emergency room. The article states that Chattanooga Police Officer James Daves arrested Eric because he drove through two red traffic lights. Unfortunately, it is occasions like this that give police officers a bad name. Again, what has happened to common sense?

Some pet owners part of problem
\
How timely and telling the two newspaper articles involving pets in Chattanooga appeared on the same day (June 16).
\
One featured an animal welfare group rescuing mistreated animals from a pet store (not an uncommon occurrence).
\
The other (a letter to the editor) expressed concern that this same group could not qualify as a ""low-killl"" shelter.
\
As long as 5 million (yes, million) unwanted dogs and cats are euthanized in this country's shelters and pounds each year, the only way a facility can be ""no-kill"" is to turn away additional homeless animals when kennel capacity has been reached. And since being fed and caged long-term is no way for an animal to live, some shelters qualify as ""slow-kill.""
\
Once again the messenger gets the blame for a problem perpetuated by people who fail to have their pets spayed or neutered. Remember, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem!

God bless people who serve homeless
\
The Salvation Army serves coffee and worship to the homeless six days a week. God bless them! The homeless know what time to be there, so within five minutes before they open, people gather around the door like a group of zombies who are hungering, not for flesh, but for coffee.
\
There is a man who comes by the Community Kitchen once a week. He passes out cheeseburgers. When you see a herd of people stampeding toward his car, you know it's the cheeseburger man. No one seems to know his name; he is only known as the cheeseburger man.
\
There is a place where no tree grows called the tree. Sometimes a church organization will bring food to feed the homeless there. You know when and where by the stampede of people.
\
And then, there is the park ... some herd, some stampede. There are also individuals who come by and pass out sandwiches, drinks and fruit.
\
How many of these homeless take time to really say thank you? I for one, along with many others, want to say God bless you and thank you.

What is the problem here? The help is out there! Why aren't we accepting it? Are we so powerful that we don't need help from anyone? Is that the government's mindset? Well, get a clue! We need all the help we can get! We are not weak by letting others help us! Heaven knows we've helped other countries enough! Let's cash in on some favors!

Don't believe liberals' promises
\
Did you pick up on Obama's EPA comment the day after the election? When asked if he would do something about terrible EPA rulings that don't really help the environment but cost lots of money and cause enormous harm to the economy, his excuse for no action was that there is a court ruling.
\
When we elect liberals, they appoint far-left judges whose rulings will be extreme left wing. The last Supreme Court judge has been quoted as in favor of using international law in some cases. This is what we get when we are too quick to believe the liberal promises. They will control each detail of life if they can. So we end up with a miserable life with no individual freedom at all.
\
On another front, according to the reports, the Obama administration has presented Israeli's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a plan for Israel to cede its rights to eastern Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley to the Palestinians. It would then lease the areas from the Palestinians for a time. After that limited time, the land would then be under total Arab control.

Election a call to change policies
\
The Republicans should not be too hasty crowing about the election results. Republicans won only because they were not Democrats. President Obama has done nothing about jobs -- the key issue for American voters.
\
As Phillip Dennis noted, this election told the Democrats that they did not approve of expanded government programs with large price tags such as bailouts, the stimulus bill, Cash for Clunkers, cap and trade and ""ObamaCare.""
\
President Bush was a spender, but President Obama has outspent him!
\
The Democrats mistook their victory in 2008 as a mandate to lead America into a European style of social democracy. The Republicans should not take this election as a victory, but as a wake-up call to return to the tea party policies of smaller government, balanced budget and fiscal responsibility. Leave the American small businesses alone and they will bring our jobs back.

City still held back by homelessness
\
I watched and read with interest the recent documentation and historical journal, ""Chattanooga's Heroic Drive: The History of a Renaissance."" It is the story of Chattanooga's ""Phoenix-like rise"" out of urban decay and the ""Dark Days"" of visible pollution to become a nationally noted, midsized city. Hundreds of millions of dollars and considerable political effort have gone into making Chattanooga a ""gem of the South."" We should all be proud of the accomplishments.
\
Problem is, there is one huge caveat that comes with this pride of ownership. When I have driven downtown on recent cold evenings and see the numbers of homeless people huddled in Miller Park and at the library, I cannot help but think that our ""Dark Days"" are still at hand.
\
Time is ""now"" for the people of Chattanooga, especially our political and corporate leadership, to pull out all the stops and end homelessness and poverty in Chattanooga. Only when this happens, will Chattanooga be a great city, a truly blessed, risen Phoenix.

Drug-testing idea good step to take
\
The Cleveland Board of Education should be commended for considering random drug testing for voluntary extracurricular activities. With the raging drug problem in Tennessee, it's important for everyone with the ability to influence kids to do so in a positive way. The school system is in a crucial authoritative position that can really deter kids from doing drugs, especially when something they love is at stake.
\
The board's desire to make sure the program they choose to implement is effective and covered financially shows their dedication to the cause. A haphazard program certainly will not do anything to help, but a program that is well thought out can make a big difference by providing students extra incentive to avoid drug use in favor of focusing on the extra-curriculars.
\
Yes, it involves record keeping, financing and defining terms, but this shouldn't discourage the board. With some creative approaches, these problems can be solved. Perhaps charging a small fee for each extracurricular activity to help offset the costs of the testing or finding an organization to donate counseling services. Hopefully the tests would deter students from using drugs and the number needing counseling would be small. The benefits would far outweigh the perceived burdens of this program.

Road closure creates hazards
\
Re: ""Ridgeside offers welcoming locale"" (letter, Nov. 5). The Chattanooga side of North Seminole Drive, sealed off by Ridgeside, is now hazardous. The arbitrary road closure does not incorporate a turnaround design. Neighbors have witnessed several fire engines trapped; I witnessed a paramedic treating a patient as the ambulance driver tried with difficulty to turn around. Would a few minutes delay make any difference to a stroke patient? Hmm.
\
When visitors, delivery trucks and residents park in the middle of the now ""dead"" end, the mail carrier has to get out of her truck to deliver mail; the garbage truck cannot turn around and therefore must roll backwards toward a hairpin turn and return backwards in order to service both sides of the street; and the big brush truck must try to maneuver backwards uphill.
\
The questionable legality of the truncation of North Seminole Drive is diminished by a larger issue: the questionable judgment of cutting off a through street with no regard for the safety and well-being of the community at large.

Monitor activities of U.S. leaders
\
After nearly two years of change we cannot believe in, American patriots had enough and voted en masse to turn a corrupt progressive government out. As President Obama reminded us in one of his many let-them- eat-cake lectures, ""elections have consequences.""
\
Take these two things from this election.
\
This was not an endorsement of the Republican Party but rejections of the progressive big government spend-and-tax policies of both parties.
\
Defenders of our Constitution must never go to sleep again; we must continue to monitor the activities of those in Washington, for they cannot be trusted.
\
Today our republic is roughly divided between two separate groups.
\
One group feels that the government should provide for their every need but they should not be asked to contribute toward their well-being or for the benefits the government provides. They have ""no skin in the game.""
\
The other group believes that each individual is responsible for themselves and their families. They work hard to obtain a better life for their loved ones. They do not mind paying fair taxes or giving a hand up to those who are truly needy, but of late our patience wears thin.

"
67,"
I am really encouraged by President Barack Obama's commitment to clean energy and combating climate change. I just have three worries: Whether he has the right policies, the right politics and the right official to sell his program. Other than that, things look great!
\
Last week, House Democrats, with administration support, introduced a 600-page draft bill on energy and climate. The center of it is a plan to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions through a complicated cap-and-trade system. These people have the very best of intentions, but I wish they would step back and ask again: Can cap-and-trade pass? Will it really work? And is it the best strategy, with all the bureaucracy it will require to monitor, auction emissions permits and manage the trading?
\
Advocates of cap-and-trade argue that it is preferable to a simple carbon tax because it fixes a national cap on carbon emissions and it ""hides the ball"" -- it doesn't use the word ""tax"" -- even though it amounts to one. So it can get through Congress. That was true as long as no one thought cap-and-trade could ever pass, but now that it might under Obama, opponents are not playing hide the ball anymore. In the past two weeks, you could hear a chorus of Republicans, coal-state Democrats, right-wing think tanks and enviro-skeptics all singing the same tune: ""Cap-and-trade is a tax. Obama is going to raise your taxes and sacrifice U.S. jobs to combat this global-warming charade, which many scientists think is nonsense. Worse, cap-and-trade will be managed by Wall Street. If you liked credit-default swaps, you're going to love carbon-offset swaps.""
\
Some of the refrains from this song have a very catchy appeal. They could easily kill this effort. So, if the Obama team cares about the ""ends"" of a stronger America and a more livable planet, as much as the ""means,"" I hope it will consider an alternative strategy, message and messenger.
\
Strategy: Since the opponents of cap-and-trade are going to pillory it as a tax anyway, why not go for the real thing -- a simple, transparent, economy-wide carbon tax?
\
Rep. John B. Larson, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, has circulated a draft bill that would impose ""a per-unit tax on the carbon-dioxide content of fossil fuels, beginning at a rate of $15 per metric ton of CO2 and increasing by $10 each year."" The bill sets a goal, rather than a cap, on emissions at 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050, and if the goal for the first five years is not met, the tax automatically increases by an additional $5 per metric ton. The bill implements a fee on carbon-intensive imports, as well, to press China to follow suit. Larson would use most of the income to reduce people's payroll taxes: We tax your carbon sins and un-tax your payroll wins.
\
People get that -- and simplicity matters. Americans will be willing to pay a tax for their children to be less threatened, breathe cleaner air and live in a more sustainable world with a stronger America. They are much less likely to support a firm in London trading offsets from an electric bill in Boston with a derivatives firm in New York in order to help fund an aluminum smelter in Beijing, which is what cap-and-trade is all about. People won't support what they can't explain.
\
Message: Climate change is a real threat to a healthy planet Earth -- the only home we have. But because the worst effects are in the future, many Americans have more immediate concerns. That is why our energy policy should be focused around ""American renewal,"" not mitigating climate change. We need a price on carbon because it will stimulate massive innovation in the next great global industry -- ET -- energy technology. In a warming world with huge population growth, clean power systems are going to be in huge demand. The scientific research and innovation needed for America to dominate ET the way it did IT could be the foundation for a second American industrial revolution, plus it would tip the whole planet onto a greener path. So American economic renewal is the goal, but mitigating climate change would be the great byproduct.
\
Messenger: The administration's carbon tax spokesman -- the one who should sell this to the country -- should be the president's national security adviser, Gen. James Jones, not the environmentalists. The imposing former head of the Marine Corps could make a powerful case that a carbon tax is vitally necessary to stimulate investments in the clean technologies that would enable the U.S. to dominate ET, while also shifting consumers to buy these new, more efficient and cleaner power systems, homes and cars.
\
He could make the case that the country with the most powerful clean-technology industry in the 21st century will have the most energy security, national security, economic security, healthy environment, innovative companies and global respect. That country must be America. So let's stop hiding the ball and have a strategy, message and messenger that tell it like it is -- and make it so.

"
68,"
It is early evening on Capitol Hill, and I am sitting with Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, who, along with Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Sen. Joe Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, is trying to craft a new energy bill -- one that could actually win 60 votes.
\
What is interesting about Graham is that he has been willing -- courageously in my view -- to depart from the prevailing GOP consensus that the only energy policy we need is ""drill, baby, drill.""
\
What brought you around, I ask? Graham's short answer: politics, jobs and legacy.
\
We start with politics. The Republican Party today has a major outreach problem with two important constituencies, ""Hispanics and young people,"" Graham explains:
\
""I have been to enough college campuses to know if you are 30 or younger this climate issue is not a debate. It's a value. These young people grew up with recycling and a sensitivity to the environment -- and the world will be better off for it. They are not brainwashed. ... From a Republican point of view, we should buy into it and embrace it and not belittle them. You can have a genuine debate about the science of climate change, but when you say that those who believe it are buying a hoax and are wacky people you are putting at risk your party's future with younger people. You can have a legitimate dispute about how to solve immigration, but when you start focusing on the last names of people the demographics will pass you by.""
\
So Graham's approach to bringing around his conservative state has been simple: avoid talking about ""climate change,"" which many on the right don't believe. Instead, frame our energy challenge as a need to ""clean up carbon pollution,"" to ""become energy independent"" and to ""create more good jobs and new industries for South Carolinians."" He proposes ""putting a price on carbon,"" starting with a very focused carbon tax, as opposed to an economywide cap-and-trade system, so as to spur both consumers and industries to invest in and buy new clean energy products. He includes nuclear energy, and insists on permitting more offshore drilling for oil and gas to give us more domestic sources, as we bridge to a new clean energy economy.
\
""Cap-and-trade as we know it is dead, but the issue of cleaning up the air and energy independence should not die -- and you will never have energy independence without pricing carbon,"" Graham argues. ""The technology doesn't make sense until you price carbon. Nuclear power is a bet on cleaner air. Wind and solar is a bet on cleaner air. ... The future economy of America and the jobs of the future are going to be tied to cleaning up the air, and in the process of cleaning up the air this country becomes energy independent and our national security is greatly enhanced.""
\
What would most help him bring around his GOP colleagues? The business lobby. ""The Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers need to tell my colleagues it is OK to price carbon, if you do it smartly,"" he says.
\
Sure, Graham's strategy will give many greens heartburn. I don't agree with every point. But if there is going to be a clean energy bill, greens and Democrats will have to recruit some Republicans. Graham says he's ready to meet them in the middle. ""We've got to get started,"" he says, ""because once we do, every CEO will adopt a carbon strategy, no matter what the law actually requires."" And for those Republicans who think this is only a loser, Graham says think again: ""What is our view of carbon as a party? Are we the party of carbon pollution forever in unlimited amounts? Pricing carbon is the key to energy independence, and the byproduct is that young people look at you differently.""
\
Look at how he is received in colleges today.
\
""Instead of being just one more short, white Republican over 50,"" says Graham, ""I am now semicool. There is an awareness by young people that I am doing something different.""
\
Five more GOP senators like him and we could have a real energy bill.
\
""We can't be a nation that always tries and fails,"" Graham concludes. ""We have to eventually get some hard problem right.""

\
Texas is burning. Our best croplands in Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri have been underwater since June. Hurricane Irene has devastated Northeast communities. People along the Mississippi, in Tuscaloosa, and Joplin are still recovering from Biblical floods and killer tornadoes. All this -- 10 weather disasters in eight months each costing more than $1 billion -- is on a scale never seen in U.S. history.
\
In another time, when government, political parties and the media weren't corporate subsidiaries, such a cataclysm would have been a call to arms and national sacrifice. Instead the climate change deniers at Exxon and FOX, in Congress and at the White House are winning the day.
\
President Barack Obama is becoming as big of a fossil fuel booster as George W. Bush. Obama has launched a run on Western coalfields on federal lands that could double U.S. carbon emissions. He's opening fragile Arctic waters to oil exploration and has delayed plans to cut power plant carbon emissions.
\
Now Obama is considering approval of the 1,661-mile Keystone XL pipeline, running from the Canadian tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico. This oil project could hurt the economy and environment, and threaten your children's future. Here's how:
\
Oil companies lie: Big oil says Keystone XL uses long-proven, safe technology. This is a lie. It uses largely untested technology. Tar sands oil is a heavier, thicker, dirtier crude, piped under higher pressure than in conventional pipelines. High pressure means oil doesn't leak slowly, but spouts in geysers.
\
The pipeline could leak: Oil companies claim a long history of pipeline safety. Another lie. There are 100 significant conventional U.S. pipeline spills annually, reports the New York Times. New high-pressure tar sands pipelines have already breached in Michigan (840,000 gallons), near Chicago (250,000 gallons), and in Alberta (1.3 million gallons).
\
Keystone XL could be the ultimate terrorist target: Why construct a pipeline that, if attacked, would harm our nation's energy supply and our food and water supply? The Keystone pipeline would run atop the Midwest's Ogallala Aquifer, crucial for heartland crop irrigation. Blow it up, or let it leak, and you disrupt 830,000 barrels of oil per day, poison groundwater and wreck our best farms.
\
Climate change is real, and the Keystone pipeline is a dangerous game changer: The Canadian tar sands are the largest untapped oil repository on earth, and could be a major climate change accelerator. Top NASA climate scientist James Hansen says this: ""The tar sands of Canada constitute a deadly threat to our planet.""
\
You might never get to use any of that oil: Big oil says tar sands oil is for U.S. consumption, but when pressed whether it might sell the oil to the highest bidder -- say, China -- oilmen declaim the idea, but they never say they won't.
\
Your kids deserve a safe future: Nature, unlike Big Oil, does not lie. The weather is changing for the worse. There is solid scientific proof that humans are causing that change, and very real concern that continued denial will mean many more billion dollar-plus storms and droughts, which could wreck our economy.
\
It's time for a national carbon tax that puts responsibility where it belongs -- on America's fossil fuel producers and energy hogs. It's time to end fossil fuel subsidies and tax breaks, and pass them on to green energy companies. It's time to end two wars, bring our troops home, and put them to work repairing and protecting flood and drought-susceptible communities. That means more, not less money, for FEMA and other disaster recovery programs. It means preparedness, not sailing blindly into the climate change storm.
\
Lastly, we need leaders willing to confront the climate change emergency. Rick Perry is not that leader. Barack Obama could be if he boldly rejects the Keystone XL pipeline.

WASHINGTON -- ""Fervently"" is how America will henceforth engage in talks on global warming. So said the president's climate change negotiator last week in Germany, at a U.N. conference on reducing carbon emissions. This vow was fervently applauded by conferees welcoming the end of what an Associated Press news story called the Bush administration's ""eight years of obdurate participation"" in climate talks.

Reducing carbon emissions supposedly will reverse warming, if it resumes after the current period without warming, a period that began, according to statistics published by the World Meteorological Organization, 11 years ago. Regarding the reversing, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has many ambitions, as outlined in a working group's 16-page ""information note"" to ""facilitate discussions."" For example:
\
""Tariffs can be lowered to grant special preference to climate-friendly goods, or they can be maintained at high levels to discourage trade in GHG (greenhouse gas)-intensive goods and services."" The working group says protectionism ""in the service of climate change objectives"" might virtuously ""shelter domestic producers of climate-friendly goods.""
\
Furthermore, using ""border carbon adjustment,"" a nation might virtuously ""impose costs on imports equivalent to that (sic) faced by domestic producers"" operating under a carbon tax. Or a nation with a cap-and-trade regime regulating carbon emissions by domestic manufacturers might require foreign manufacturers ""to buy offsets at the border equal to that (sic) which the producer would have been forced to purchase had the good been produced domestically.""
\
Cynics will see only potential for mischief by governments, including the U.S. government, using such measures to give a green patina to protectionism. Meanwhile, the U.S. government is having its own problems with one ""climate-friendly good"" that might not be. Last week The New York Times front page carried this headline: ""The Bulb That Saved the Planet May Be a Little Less Than Billed.""
\
The story recounted some Americans' misadventures with the new light bulbs that almost all Americans -- all but those who are filling their closets with supplies of today's incandescent bulbs -- will have to use after the phaseout of today's bulbs in 2014. (You missed that provision of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007?)
\
A San Francisco -- naturally -- couple emerged from Al Gore's movie ""An Inconvenient Truth"" incandescent with desire to think globally and act locally, in their home. So they replaced their incandescent bulbs with the compact fluorescents that Congress says must soon be ubiquitous. ""Instead of having a satisfying green moment, however,"" the Times reported, ""they wound up coping with a mess.""
\
Although supposed to last 10,000 hours and save, the Times says, ""as much as"" $5.40 a year in electricity costs, some bulbs died within a few hours. Some experts, reports the Times, ""blame the government for the quality problems,"" saying its push to cut the bulbs' prices prompted manufacturers to use inferior components.
\
Furthermore, some experts have written a guide saying the new bulbs require ""a little insight and planning."" The Times says that ""may be an understatement.""
\
The bulbs, says the Times, ""do not do well in hot places with little airflow, like recessed ceiling fixtures,"" and some do not work ""with dimmers or three-way sockets."" And: ""Be aware that compact fluorescents can take one to three minutes to reach full brightness. This is not a defect."" Well, if you say so. Because all fluorescents contain mercury, a toxic metal, they must never be put in the trash, so Home Depot and other chains offer bins for disposing of dangerous bulbs. Driving to one of these disposal points might not entirely nullify the bulbs' environmental benefits. Besides, the Times summarizes the Environmental Protection Agency's helpful suggestions for coping with the environmental dangers caused when one of these environment-saving bulbs breaks:
\
""Clear people and pets from the room and open a window for at least 15 minutes if possible. Avoid vacuuming. Scoop up larger pieces with stiff paper or cardboard, pick up smaller residue with sticky tape, and wipe the area with a damp cloth. Put everything into a sealed plastic bag or sealed glass jar. In most cases, this can be put in the trash, but the EPA recommends checking local rules.""
\
Worrywarts wonder what will happen when a lazy or careless, say, 10 percent of 300 million Americans put their worn-out bulbs in the trash. Stop worrying. What do you think? That Congress, architect of the ethanol industry and designer of automobiles, does not think things through?

SAN JOSE, Costa Rica -- Hmmm. You think it's a coincidence? Costa Rica is one of the very few countries to have abolished its army, and it's also arguably the happiest nation on earth.
\
There are several ways of measuring happiness in countries, all inexact, but this pearl of Central America does stunningly well by whatever system is used. For example, the World Database of Happiness, compiled by a Dutch sociologist on the basis of answers to surveys by Gallup and others, lists Costa Rica in the top spot out of 148 nations.
\
That's because Costa Ricans, asked to rate their own happiness on a 10-point scale, average 8.5. Denmark is next at 8.3, the United States ranks 20th at 7.4 and Togo and Tanzania bring up the caboose at 2.6.
\
Scholars also calculate happiness by determining ""happy life years."" This figure results from merging average self-reported happiness, as above, with life expectancy. Using this system, Costa Rica again easily tops the list. The United States is 19th, and Zimbabwe comes in last.
\
A third approach is the ""happy planet index,"" devised by the New Economics Foundation, a liberal think tank. This combines happiness and longevity but adjusts for environmental impact -- such as the carbon that countries spew.
\
Here again, Costa Rica wins the day, for achieving contentment and longevity in an environmentally sustainable way. The Dominican Republic ranks second, the United States 114th (because of its huge ecological footprint) and Zimbabwe is last.
\
Maybe Costa Rican contentment has something to do with the chance to explore dazzling beaches on both sides of the country, when one isn't admiring the sloths in the jungle. Costa Rica has done an unusually good job preserving nature, and it's surely easier to be happy while basking in sunshine and greenery than while shivering up north and suffering ""nature deficit disorder.""
\
What sets Costa Rica apart is its remarkable decision in 1949 to dissolve its armed forces and invest instead in education. Increased schooling created a more stable society, less prone to the conflicts that have raged elsewhere in Central America. Education also boosted the economy, enabling the country to become a major exporter of computer chips and improving English-language skills so as to attract American eco-tourists.
\
I'm not anti-military. But the evidence is strong that education is often a far better investment than artillery.
\
In Costa Rica, rising education levels also fostered impressive gender equality so that it ranks higher than the United States in the World Economic Forum gender gap index. This allows Costa Rica to use its female population more productively than is true in most of the region. Likewise, education nurtured improvements in health care, with life expectancy now about the same as in the United States -- a bit longer in some data sets, a bit shorter in others.
\
Rising education levels also led the country to preserve its lush environment as an economic asset. Costa Rica is an ecological pioneer, introducing a carbon tax in 1997. The Environmental Performance Index, a collaboration of Yale and Columbia universities, ranks Costa Rica at No. 5 in the world, the best outside Europe.
\
This emphasis on the environment hasn't sabotaged Costa Rica's economy but has bolstered it. Indeed, Costa Rica is one of the few countries that is seeing migration from the United States: Yankees are moving here to enjoy a low-cost retirement. My hunch is that in 25 years, we'll see large numbers of English-speaking retirement communities along the Costa Rican coast.
\
Latin countries generally do well in happiness surveys. Mexico and Colombia rank higher than the United States in self-reported contentment. Perhaps one reason is a cultural emphasis on family and friends, on social capital over financial capital -- but then again, Mexicans sometimes slip into the United States, presumably in pursuit of both happiness and assets.
\
Cross-country comparisons of happiness are controversial and uncertain. But what does seem quite clear is that Costa Rica's national decision to invest in education rather than arms has paid rich dividends. Maybe the lesson for the United States is that we should devote fewer resources to shoring up foreign armies and more to bolstering schools both at home and abroad.
\
In the meantime, I encourage you to conduct your own research in Costa Rica, exploring those magnificent beaches or admiring those slothful sloths. It'll surely make you happy.

There is much in the House cap-and-trade energy bill that just passed that I absolutely hate. It is too weak in key areas and way too complicated in others. A simple, straightforward carbon tax would have made much more sense than this Rube Goldberg contraption. It is pathetic that we couldn't do better. It is appalling that so much had to be given away to polluters. It stinks. It's a mess. I detest it.
\
Now let's get it passed in the Senate and make it law.
\
Why? Because, for all its flaws, this bill is the first comprehensive attempt by America to mitigate climate change by putting a price on carbon emissions. Rejecting this bill would have been read in the world as America voting against the reality and urgency of climate change and would have undermined clean energy initiatives everywhere.
\
More important, my gut tells me that if the U.S. government puts a price on carbon, even a weak one, it will usher in a new mind-set among consumers, investors, farmers, innovators and entrepreneurs that in time will make a big difference -- much like the first warnings that cigarettes could cause cancer. The morning after that warning no one ever looked at smoking the same again.
\
Ditto if this bill passes. Henceforth, every investment decision made in America -- about how homes are built, products manufactured or electricity generated -- will look for the least-cost low-carbon option. And weaving carbon emissions into every business decision will drive innovation and deployment of clean technologies to a new level and make energy efficiency much more affordable. That ain't beanbag.
\
Now that the bill is heading for the Senate, though, we must, ideally, try to improve it, but, at a minimum, guard against diluting it any further. To do that we need the help of the three parties most responsible for how weak the bill already is: the Republican Party, President Barack Obama and We the People.
\
This bill is not weak because its framers, Reps. Henry Waxman and Ed Markey, wanted it this way. ""They had to make the compromises they did,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, ""because almost every House Republican voted against the bill and did nothing to try to improve it. So to get it passed, they needed every coal-state Democrat, and that meant they had to water it down to bring them on board.""
\
What are Republicans thinking? It is not as if they put forward a different strategy, like a carbon tax. Does the GOP want to be the party of sex scandals and polluters or does it want to be a partner in helping America dominate the next great global industry: ET -- energy technology? How could Republicans become so anti-environment, just when the country is going green?
\
Historically speaking, ""Republicans can claim as much credit for America's environmental leadership as Democrats,"" noted Glenn Prickett, senior vice president at Conservation International. ""The two greatest environmental presidents in American history were Teddy Roosevelt, who created our national park system, and Richard Nixon, whose administration gave us the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency."" The elder George Bush signed the 1993 Rio Treaty, to preserve biodiversity.
\
Yes, this bill's goal of reducing U.S. carbon emissions to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 is nowhere near what science tells us we need to mitigate climate change. But it also contains significant provisions to prevent new buildings from becoming energy hogs, to make our appliances the most energy efficient in the world and to help preserve forests in places like the Amazon.
\
We need Republicans who believe in fiscal conservatism and conservation joining this legislation in the Senate. We want a bill that transforms the whole country not one that just threads a political needle. I hope they start listening to green Republicans like Dick Lugar, George Shultz and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
\
I also hope we will hear more from Obama. Something feels very calculating in how he has approached this bill, as if he doesn't quite want to get his hands dirty, as if he is ready to twist arms in private, but not so much that if the bill goes down he will get tarnished. That is no way to fight this war. He is going to have to mobilize the whole country to pressure the Senate -- by educating Americans, with speech after speech, about the opportunities and necessities of a serious climate/energy bill. If he is not ready to risk failure by going all out, failure will be the most likely result.
\
And then there is We the People. Attention all young Americans: Your climate future is being decided right now in the cloakrooms of the Capitol, where the coal lobby holds huge sway. You want to make a difference? Then get out of Facebook and into somebody's face. Get a million people on the Washington Mall calling for a price on carbon. That will get the Senate's attention. Play hardball or don't play at all.

73,"By Chas Sisk\THE TENNESSEAN\As the state tries to reap the benefits of a growing solar industry that could bring thousands of new jobs and billions in new investment, the massive projects also bring with them environmental challenges in the form of intensive manufacturing operations that will draw a tremendous amount of electricity from the state's power grid used to run sprawling chemical reactors.\With just two investments -- Hemlock Semiconductor Group near Clarksville and a similar Wacker Chemie AG plant near Chattanooga -- Tennessee is poised to become a nationwide leader in the production of polysilicon crystals, the basic building block for the solar industry. Together, these plants will cost at least $2.2 billion to construct.\Meanwhile, the state also is pitching a third site in West Tennessee for solar, and it is putting together plans to build a $35 million ""solar institute"" at Oak Ridge National Laboratory that will research the industry.\At least at the outset, these solar companies' demand for electricity may actually increase the state's dependency on polluting, coal-fired power plants operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.\The plants also raise possible environmental and safety hazards, as potentially dangerous chlorine-based gases and liquids are heated to temperatures exceeding 3,600 degrees, then stored and recycled.\Many officials have been quick to describe these plants as ""green,"" based on the fact that the materials they produce will eventually be used to make solar panels that can curb the nation's dependence on coal and natural gas.\But the state's budding solar sector also is an outgrowth of its established chemicals industry. The companies themselves cite access to cheap and reliable power and proximity to chlorine suppliers as main reasons for putting their plants in Tennessee.\Keeping these plants safe and economically viable will require strict enforcement of state and federal laws, scientists and environmentalists say.\The state itself also bears a financial risk. Besides extending $100 million or more in direct subsidies and infrastructure improvements, the state has promised to cover the cost of any carbon offsets that the plants may need, if the U.S. Congress passes a cap-and-trade plan to combat global warming.\""I think the reason we got the plants was Tennessee promised them we'd hold them harmless from whatever federal environmental regulation there would be,"" U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper said in an interview soon after the investments were announced. ""We need to be getting a handle on that.""\Supporters acknowledge those challenges but are quick to say the costs are worthwhile. With very little solar panel production in the United States right now, the state is poised to get in on the ground floor of an industry with nearly boundless potential, they say.\""The governor talks about these plants as being the anchors around which we're going to develop a whole industry,"" said Matt Kisber, the state's commissioner for economic and community development. ""Landing Hemlock and Wacker together is a transformational opportunity for Tennessee.""\Strategy was departure\Tennessee's bid to become the center of the solar industry started not quite two years ago, when Gov. Phil Bredesen asked Kisber and Reagan Farr, the state's revenue commissioner, to come up with a strategy to promote the green energy sector. The strategy represented a departure for the state, which for more than two decades has focused its efforts on heavy manufacturing, particularly the automobile industry.\Tennessee, however, had some assets it could use to its advantage. A central location makes it convenient to other markets, and a system of subsidies and tax credits for job training and infrastructure improvements meant companies could build a plant and reap a profit more quickly.\The state also had a portfolio of large industrial sites near railroads, highways and high-tension power lines operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.\It's that last element that is perhaps the most important for the solar industry. The raw material used in solar panel production is polysilicon, a purified form of silicon that is cut into thin wafers and covered with glass. Polysilicon is made from quartzite, one of the most common rocks on the planet, but making it requires heating the quartzite to more than 3,600 degrees in a massive electric arc furnace, then refining it for more than a week.\Another asset has been Tennessee's well-developed chemicals industry. Breaking quartzite down into pure silicon means exposing it to some kind of catalyst. Usually this is a chlorine-based chemical, such as hydrochloric acid.\In announcing its investment in February, Germany-based Wacker said that the East Tennessee presence of its chlorine supplier, Olin Corp., helped clinch its decision to locate its $1 billion polysilicon plant in Bradley County, 30 miles northeast of Chattanooga.\The two Tennessee plants will be among the first in the nation dedicated solely to producing polysilicon for the solar industry.\The market for polysilicon is uncertain, and prices have fluctuated wildly, along with other energy prices during the recession. But demand for polysilicon is expected to grow, as states and the federal government take steps to encourage the instillation of solar panels, said Cai Steger, an economist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.\Solar has quick payoff\Environmental groups, such as the NRDC, have embraced solar enthusiastically. Besides being renewable, solar panels have a quick payoff. Studies show that within two to four years a solar panel turns out more power than was used to create it, and the greenhouse gas emissions from production of a solar panel are 80 percent to 90 percent less than those turned out by a coal plant.\But no solar power will be used to produce polysilicon in Tennessee, at least initially. Neither Hemlock nor Wacker has committed to purchase power from green energy sources. Instead, they will buy electricity from TVA, which generates most of its power from coal, dams and nuclear plants.\The state's third potential solar site, in Haywood County in West Tennessee, could feature a solar array. To encourage development there, officials in the Bredesen administration have asked the federal government to approve roughly $30 million in stimulus funding for construction of a solar array. That request is still under review.\The source of Hemlock and Wacker's power is not just an environmental matter. It also could have an impact on the state budget.\A state law passed last year says that Tennessee will pay for any carbon-emission taxes placed on solar plants like the Hemlock and Wacker facilities through a federal cap-and-trade system. The law places no limit on how much the state will pay out.\State officials say the law was needed to persuade Hemlock and Wacker not to locate outside the United States, where there is not a threat of a carbon tax. They say they plan to lobby Congress to carve out an exception for plants that make solar and green energy generation equipment.\""Governor Bredesen is a budget-minded guy ... so I'm confident he's looked at that,"" Cooper said in an interview last week. ""It's important to keep in mind that Congress hasn't approved the carbon tax, so that part of the increase may not apply.""\Safety records are good\A second challenge is handling the chemicals needed to make polysilicon.\Generally, the polysilicon industry's environmental and safety record has been good, said Seth Kaplan, the head of the climate advocacy group at the Conservation Law Foundation in Boston. Although polysilicon production for the solar industry is relatively new, the material has been produced in large quantities for the semiconductor sector for decades, with few incidents.\But that may be the result of tight regulation, Kaplan said.\""You are potentially dealing with stuff that you've got to do right,"" he said. ""And for whatever reason, silicon production previously has tended to be located in places with pretty rigorous systems for dealing with that, places like California, Massachusetts and Germany.""\The state will spend millions to train workers for the solar industry. Hemlock alone is expected to receive $5 million for job training, and $6.4 million will be used to create a chemical technology program at Austin Peay State University, where 150 to 175 students a year will be trained in proper handling of chemicals and heavy equipment. Hemlock will contribute $2 million to that program.\Because their product has to be so pure, silicon producers have an incentive to run clean, efficient operations that minimize safety and environmental hazards, said Robin Reed, the Austin Peay chemistry department chairman.\Hemlock and Wacker say they plan to recycle the chemical byproducts from their operations. Hemlock says its final discharge is a salty brine that can be handled by the city sewer.\But Reed said the jump to solar production also provides an opportunity to improve the state's environmental laws.\""The state has its ability to go above and beyond what the federal government has done,"" Reed said. ""Personally, I would like to see Tennessee step up its efforts in terms of its stewardship of the environment and chemicals handling.""\Meanwhile, work has already begun on Hemlock's facility in Montgomery County. Three miles east outside Clarksville, bulldozers are flattening a 1,200-acre farm, preparing the ground for an October start on construction.\Eight hundred people will work at the plant once it opens, and perhaps thousands more from spinoff facilities.\""Look at Spring Hill, what Saturn did for them, and what Fort Campbell has done for our community,"" Clarksville Mayor Johnny Piper said.

75,"
There is only one meaningful response to the horrific oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and that is for America to stop messing around when it comes to designing its energy and environmental future. The only meaningful response to this man-made disaster is a man-made energy bill that finally would put in place an American clean-energy infrastructure that would set our country on a real, long-term path to ending our addiction to oil.
\
That is so obviously the right thing for our environment, the right thing for our national security, the right thing for our economic security and the right thing to promote innovation. But it means that we have to stop messing around with idiotic ""Drill, baby, drill"" nostrums, feel-good Earth Day concerts and the paralyzing notion that the American people are not prepared to do anything serious to change our energy mix. This oil spill is to the environment what the subprime mortgage mess was to the markets -- both a wake-up call and an opportunity to galvanize a constituency for radical change that overcomes the powerful lobbies and vested interests that want to keep us addicted to oil.
\
If President Obama wants to seize this moment, it is there for the taking. We have one of the worst environmental disasters in American history on our hands. We have a public deeply troubled by what they've seen already -- and they've probably seen only the first reel of this gulf horror show. And we have a bipartisan climate/energy/jobs bill ready to be introduced in the Senate -- produced by Sens. John Kerry, Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham -- that would set a price on carbon and begin to shift us to a system of cleaner fuels and greater energy efficiency, and unlock an avalanche of private capital to the clean energy market. U.S. industry is ready to act and is basically saying to Washington: ""Every major country in the world, starting with China, is putting in clear, long-term market rules to stimulate clean energy -- except America. Just give us some clear rules, and we'll do the rest.""
\
The Kerry-Lieberman-Graham bill is an important step in that direction. It is far from perfect. It includes support for more off-shore drilling, nuclear power and concessions to coal companies. In light of the spill, we need to make this bill better. At a minimum, we need much tighter safeguards on off-shore drilling. There is going to be a lot of pressure to go even further, but we need to remember that even if we halted all off-shore drilling, all we would be doing is moving the production to other areas outside the U.S., probably with even weaker environmental laws.
\
Somehow a compromise has to be found to move forward on this bill -- or one like it. But even before the spill, this bill was in limbo because the White House and Senate Democrats broke a promise to Graham, the lone Republican supporting this effort, not to introduce a controversial immigration bill before energy. At the same time, Obama has kept his support low key, fearing that if he loudly endorses a price on carbon, Republicans will be screaming ""carbon tax"" and ""gasoline tax"" in the midterm elections.
\
Bottom line: This bill has no chance to pass unless Obama gets behind it with all his power, mobilizes the public and rounds up the votes. He has to lead from the front, not the rear. Responding to this oil spill could well become the most important leadership test of the Obama presidency. The president always has had the right instincts on energy, but he is going to have to decide just how much he wants to rise to this occasion -- whether to generate just an emergency response that over months ends the spill or a systemic response that over time ends our addiction. Needless to say, it would be a lot easier for the president to lead if more than one Republican in the Senate was ready to lift a finger to help him.
\
If we settle for just an incremental response to this crisis -- a ""Hey, that's our democracy. What more can you expect?"" -- we'll be sorry. You can't fool Mother Nature. She knows when we're just messing around. Mother Nature operates by her own iron laws. And if we violate them, there is no lobby or big donor to get us off the hook. No, what's gone will be gone. What's ruined will be ruined. What's extinct will be extinct -- and later, when we're finally ready to stop messing around, it will be too late.

It is rare that business, labor and farming interests have a common position on any issue. In Tennessee, however, representatives of these groups are on the same side in opposition to President Clinton's proposals on a global warming treaty. This article is by Jim Neely, president of the Tennessee AFL-CIO Labor Council; Carter Witt, president, Tennessee Association of Business; and Flavius Barker, president, Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation.
\
So much has been debated on the issue of global warming recently that it's hard to know for sure what and whom we should believe. There are people who support efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions -- often labeled as left-wing environmentalists who are seeking reductions at any cost.
\
Then there are people who oppose the current proposal -- these people often being labeled as ``polluters'' and ``big business.'' But the truth of the matter is that both sides have the best intentions for the world in which we live. Everyone can at least agree that we want to protect the environment. It is the process by and the cost at which we achieve this that is the center of the current debate.
\
The process includes an ongoing debate focusing on whether or not global warming is actually occurring -- it seems scientists can argue either side convincingly. Now we are faced with entering into a binding commitment to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Quite a big leap to take without having completed research that would fill in a lot of the gaps between fact and fiction.
\
Here are the facts about the current proposal: The process proposed by the president, unveiled on Oct. 22, asks for mandatory caps by industrial nations on greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, at 1990 levels by 2008-2012, with further reductions after that.
\
It asks for a $5 billion program to encourage energy efficiency and develop new energy technologies that would have to be approved by Congress. For countries that can't meet emission caps, an international pollution trading system would be established where countries could buy pollution credits from countries that are below caps.
\
Finally, developing countries like Mexico, China and India must agree to participate in future reductions before the United States would commit to binding obligations. What this all means, in terms of how, how much and exactly when, is unclear.
\
So, the president is asking Americans to buy an expensive insurance policy without first understanding either the risks or the costs. With the treaty on global climate scheduled to be signed this month, there is little time for American consumers to know what they're being asked to buy into without having addressed critical questions which scientists say will take at least another five years to answer.
\
Here's what is at risk:
\
According to recent studies, businesses will be greatly affected. Total output in the U.S. (GDP) would decline $228 billion below the baseline, and total output in Tennessee (GSP) would drop $4.2 billion below the baseline. American workers will be hurt because it lets our economic competitors like India and China off the hook and creates programs which would require U.S. industries to pay for modernizing their foreign competitors. As a result, the U.S. would lose 1.8 million jobs and Tennessee would lose 35,400 jobs.
\
American consumers would be adversely affected. If new taxes are enacted to meet the standards, that would significantly impact the overall level of output as well as the composition of output in the state. Hardest hit in the state would be apparel and transportation businesses due to the projected shift in these industries to overseas producers. Wages and salaries would also fall under the imposition of a carbon tax. Rising costs must be offset by lower real wages as economies attempt to retain their competitive position.
\
Energy prices would rise dramatically. Gasoline prices could rise by as much a 50 cents per gallon. The consumer price for food is projected to escalate substantially faster than the baseline projection. Under the carbon limit scenario, food prices would be 9.5 percent higher than the baseline in 2010.
\
Tennesseans would be faced with the possibility of a significant decline in tax revenue and would be projected to lose a considerable share of manufacturing jobs. Combined with the lower tax revenues, this would represent a significant decline in the support Tennessee could provide its unemployed.
\
This action would hurt American consumers by driving up costs on everything from fuel to most consumer goods -- and it still wouldn't cut greenhouse gas emissions, because it fails to address definitively how developing countries, which will account for the largest growth of greenhouse gases in the future, will be required to participate.
\
The truth is, we need to fully understand the issues before forcing new taxes and regulations down United States citizens' throats. We also don't need to pass standards that won't effectively protect the environment. The process has just begun. Let's all take some time to sort through the facts and fiction.

77,"Growing up in rural, southeastern Tennessee, Sage Kafsky recalls her early love of forests, public lands and ""the beauty of the world around us.""\While attending Middle Tennessee State University, Kafsky learned about politics and the environment. More recently, she developed an admiration for the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, whose defiance before the most powerful business and political leaders on the planet became the face of a new generation fighting climate change.\But Kafsky, 23, comes at climate change from a different vantage point from many of her generation's more liberal peers.\While many of them have embraced the Green New Deal and its proposed massive shift in federal spending to create jobs and hasten a transition to clean energy by 2050, Kafsky embraces the American Climate Contract, a self-described response to the Green New Deal for the political right.\It was unveiled last month by the American Conservation Coalition, for which Kafsky volunteers.\She and other young activists want their political elders in the Republican Party to acknowledge the real challenges of global warming and support policies to address them, without sacrificing traditional GOP principles like market competition and limited government.\They have issued their manifesto in a presidential election year, when the stakes couldn't be higher. While President Donald Trump remains a resolute climate change denier, there is a wide consensus among scientists, and also in the military, that climate change is happening now, causing higher temperatures and heat waves, sea-level rise, increasing frequency of extreme rains, wetter and more intense hurricanes, and longer droughts.\""I 100% believe in climate change,"" Kafsky said in a telephone interview from her home in Ducktown, Tennessee, in the southern Appalachian Mountains, where she works as a paraprofessional in an elementary school. ""I believe in people like Greta, who are having their voice, saying this is a major issue and we need to fix it.""\But, Kafsky said, ""how to get there gets lost in translation"" amid political polarization, even though ""we have similar goals in mind.""\In the South and across much of the United States, one way to try to tell a Republican from a Democrat is to invite a discussion about climate change.\Pew Research Center polling in February found a growing number of Americans say tackling climate change should be a top priority for the president and Congress. But that change in views is mostly among Democrats: roughly 4 out of 5 say dealing with climate change should be a top priority, compared to just 1 out of 5 Republicans, Pew found.\Climate change wasn't always so divisive.\In 2008, for example, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and former Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, famously sat on a couch in front of the U.S. Capitol, declaring they both agreed the country needed to take action on climate change. And they did it for Al Gore, the former vice president and global warming evangelist from Tennessee, who became conservatives' climate-change punching bag\Today, young climate activists led by Thunberg and the Sunrise Movement — a grassroots youth climate action group that formed after Trump's 2016 election — are the defiant voice for the climate, calling for a transformation of the global economy. They are carrying out global student strikes and persuading mayors to declare climate emergencies.\The demographics of climate politics are shifting, said Ed Maibach, professor and director of the George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communications.\While young Democrats and their parents and grandparents are ""more or less all apoplectically concerned"" about the climate, he said, a new report from the George Mason center and the Yale Program on Climate Communication identifies how young Republicans are becoming emboldened by the issue. In contrast to older Republicans, they have become more accepting of the human causes of climate change, rejecting the climate science denial that has taken hold in the party, Maibach said.\""The more young Democrats get involved in the issue, the more young Republicans get pulled along,"" he added.\Both parties will have plenty to debate this year as voters in November decide whether to give Trump and his fossil fuel agenda another four years. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, the former vice president, has described the Green New Deal as ""a crucial framework"" for climate action as he tries to convince climate voters he's a true believer.\The American Conservation Coalition was founded in 2017 by Benji Backer, a 22-year-old from Appleton, Wisconsin, who was already a veteran in national political circles.\In 2014, at 16, Backer delivered a fiery speech at the influential American Conservative Union conference, defending former Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker's bitter and successful battle against unionized teachers and declaring it ""OK to stand up to those on the left that would scream us into quiet submission.""\But in September, he testified before Congress with Thunberg, arguing that ""we cannot regulate our way out of climate change.""\The group and its climate contract have supporters ranging from natural gas lobbyists and libertarians to conservation and energy efficiency groups.\One of them is the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Colorado-based clean-energy think tank founded by physicist Amory Lovins. The institute's Paul Bodner, who worked on energy and climate in the White House for President Barack Obama, is on the coalition's advisory board. He hopes he can help the young conservatives find their voice on climate issues.\The institute, he said, agrees with the Green New Deal's ""call to action"" and shares its vision of ""radical decarbonization of the U.S. economy,"" but also agrees with the coalition's ""focus on unleashing market forces.""\The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank, also supports the young conservatives.\""When we see historically controversial policies that are pushed through by one party in a very politicized or polarized manner, those policies are more at risk of being undone, or vilified, at some point in the future,"" said Sasha Mackler, the center's director of energy projects. ""For policies to be enduring over the long term, which is really what we need for a climate solution to be effective, bipartisanship is essential.""\The young conservatives' contract makes no mention of the 2016 Paris climate agreement, with its goal of limiting rising global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Nor does it share the sense of urgency expressed by scientists, who, in 2018, concluded that the world had about 12 years to get on a path toward zero carbon emissions by 2050.\Instead, the contract merely acknowledges the need to ""move towards the goal of global net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.""\The Green New Deal envisions a rapid transition to a carbon-free economy, promising jobs and economic security and explicitly supporting an economic transition in communities that have long lived on incomes from fossil fuel industries.\By contrast, the contract modestly calls for ""targeted investment and regulatory streamlining;"" increasing clean transportation; creating a more energy-saving electrical grid; maximizing carbon storage in forests and farms; planting trees; supporting nuclear power; and establishing private-public partnerships.\""We would rather not get caught up in debates on targets that are too much for one side of the aisle or the other,"" said Danielle Butcher, chief operating officer of the American Conservation Coalition. ""We view this not as a silver bullet to climate policy.""\The contract also does not recommend a carbon tax, which some moderates and Republicans have begun to embrace as a way to put a price on carbon and steer the economy toward a lower-carbon future.\""We want to focus on the steps we can take right now,"" Butcher said.\The contract's modest scope is its failing, critics counter.\Fighting climate change and economic injustice go hand-in-hand, said Sofie Karasek, a spokeswoman for the Sunrise Movement, which has rallied around the Green New Deal.\""A lot of young people have grown up with the fear of the climate crisis, and we already lived through 'the great recession,' and remember what that felt like,"" Karasek said.\What's needed are ""bold solutions from the government at the scale of the problems we face, and right now (with the COVID-19 pandemic) we are facing a great depression while also staring down the barrel of climate change,"" she said. ""We don't have time to talk about private-public partnerships or whatever.""\In Tennessee, Kafsky points to retiring U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander, 79, as an example of political moderation. Kafsky credits Alexander with acknowledging climate change while ""pursuing legitimate options (that) will lay the groundwork for others.""\Alexander berated the Green New Deal as ""an assault on cars, cows and combustion."" But he also advocates for a new Manhattan Project for Clean Energy, with heavy federal investment in clean energy and nuclear technology research to reduce carbon emissions. It's a nod to the original Manhattan Project that built the first atomic bomb, work that was done in part at the federal energy lab in Oak Ridge.\But in Washington, D.C., it has been Kentucky's Mitch McConnell, 78, the coal-friendly Senate Republican leader since 2006 and majority leader since 2015, who has, in effect, been setting the Republican legislative agenda on climate.\For example, he led the opposition to Obama's climate and coal policies, then backed Trump on pulling out of the Paris agreement. Last year McConnell went out of his way to force Democrats to make a premature and what he hoped would be a politically damaging vote on the Green New Deal, while not offering alternative climate legislation.\McConnell is up for reelection to a seventh term in November. A spokesman declined to comment on the young conservatives' efforts, except to say that the way to address climate change ""is through technology and innovation.""\But words alone may not be enough for the GOP's new generation.\In McConnell's hometown of Louisville, a new member of the American Climate Coalition, Benjamin Myles, said that he's frustrated by any Republican elder who does not take climate change seriously, including McConnell.\""There is definitely frustration for myself and younger people who look at this issue and see the Republican Party, especially older GOP members, just ignoring it instead of offering an alternative,"" said Myles, a junior at the University of Louisville studying political science and economics.\""Our political system is all about providing multiple options,"" Myles said.

79,"eugenerobinson@washpost.com\WASHINGTON -- How is it possible that BP chief executive Tony Hayward hasn't been fired? At this point, how can anyone believe a word the man says? If he told me my mother loves me, I'd want a second source.\Hayward has apologized for his one lapse of candor -- the now-famous whine last Sunday that ""I'd like my life back."" It must be a nice life indeed: According to Forbes, Hayward's total compensation from BP in 2009 was about $4.6 million. The Louisiana fishermen who've been put out of work by the oil spill are accustomed to getting by on considerably less.\Within hours, though, Hayward's foot was firmly lodged in his mouth yet again. The effort to contain the oil and keep it away from the Gulf Coast has been ""very successful,"" he told the Financial Times. ""Considering how big this has been, very little has got away from us.""\This sunny assessment came as television networks broadcast images of oil-soaked Louisiana marshes, where hazmat-suited workers -- who said they were under orders from BP not to talk to the media, on pain of getting fired -- were trying to sop up the mess with what looked like rags, as if this were a gargantuan kitchen mishap. Meanwhile, mousse-like clumps of ""weathered"" oil were being washed onto beaches in Alabama, and authorities in Florida were watching the approach of a menacing, oily sheen. Scientists have not even begun to assess the potential long-term effects of the oil spill on human health, marine life and coastal ecology. Carol Browner, the president's chief adviser on energy and the environment, said that the Deepwater Horizon incident is already the worst environmental disaster in United States history.\Give yourself another pat on the back, Tony.\And as for those giant underwater oil plumes that scientists and journalists keep discovering? Hayward denies they exist. His position is that of a philanderer caught in the act by an irate spouse: ""Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?""\Somebody, please, give the man his life back.\But once that's done, let's turn our ire on the real villains. This exercise will require a mirror.\An accident like the Deepwater Horizon blowout was bound to happen sooner or later. There are nearly 4,000 oil rigs off the Gulf Coast, and those pumping most of the crude are in deep waters -- where, as we now know, state-of-the-art safety procedures are inadequate. President Obama's moratorium on deep-water drilling will last only long enough for some sort of technological band-aid to be devised. Then we'll crank up the drills once again.\We know that our dependence on oil is ultimately ruinous, yet we refuse to take measures -- a meaningful carbon tax, for example -- to ease it. Long after Tony Hayward answers for his sins, we'll be paying for our own."

It is not the intention of Americans to send any of our U.S. jobs to India or Communist China. But if we're not careful, we may do that.
\
We've heard of ""cheap labor"" in some foreign countries. But in this case, the problem is not payrolls but carbon dioxide.
\
President Ed Feulner of the highly respected, independent, Washington-based Heritage Foundation, warns us that last year, the Environmental Protection Agency issued an ""Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking"" that could have a tremendously negative effect on American jobs. It involves regulation of carbon dioxide emissions.
\
Did we say ""regulation""? Mr. Feulner notes that in 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide may be considered a pollutant as defined by the Clean Air Act. The notice of EPA rule-making and its supporting documents runs to 18,000 pages! How's that for ""regulation""?
\
""CO2, of course, is a naturally-occurring gas,"" Mr. Feulner reminded in a recent column. ""It's produced whenever a person breathes and, yes, whenever we use any sort of fossil fuel. Driving a car, mowing a lawn, boiling a cup of water, even flipping on a light switch (thus using electricity generated in CO2-emitting power plants) produces carbon dioxide.""
\
All of this is of current interest because we don't want any increase in ""greenhouse gases"" that might adversely affect our environment.
\
But what about affecting our economy?
\
""A study last year from The Heritage Foundation predicted CO2 regulations could cost up to 800,000 jobs per year in some years,"" Mr. Feulner noted. ""Even in a 'good' year, our economy could lose more than half a million jobs every year from 2015 through 2026. (These are net job losses, by the way. The Heritage estimate takes into account all the 'green' jobs the government is supposedly going to create, and still shows hundreds of thousands of lost jobs each year.)""
\
The result of excessively strict anti-CO2 regulations could put as many as 3 million people out of work, Mr. Feulner observes: ""That's because business owners, faced with a massive carbon tax, would pack up and move their plants to China, India or some other location where the government doesn't impose exorbitant costs.""
\
Mr. Feulner explains, ""As Heritage energy expert Ben Lieberman testified before Congress, the trouble starts as soon as the (cap and trade) bill's provisions take effect in 2012. 'For a household of four, energy costs go up $436 that year, and they eventually reach $1,241 in 2035 and average $829 annually over that span. Electricity costs go up 90 percent by 2035, gasoline by 58 percent, and natural gas by 55 percent by 2035. The cumulative higher energy costs for a family of four by then will be nearly $20,000.' ""
\
It should be obvious that we do not want to permit hazardous or otherwise harmful emissions. But we also do not want to rush in, with less than clear and definite information, to unwise actions that would do drastically harmful things to our economy and our way of life.
\
We obviously need to be sure of our science, be aware of the economic consequences, and develop practical ways to reduce and avoid any really damaging emissions -- all without ruining our American economy and American way of life, while Communist China and India increase objectionable emissions.

81,"By SCOTT BRODEN SBRODEN@DNJ.COM\-- Scott Broden, 615-278-5158\U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, an ardent opponent of the federal government's $787 million stimulus plan, told business professionals Wednesday that Americans will get through the economic crisis by making ""a shared sacrifice.""\""We will get it right,"" Corker said. ""Our best days lie ahead.""\A Republican from Chattanooga, Corker traveled to Murfreesboro to speak at a Rutherford County Chamber of Commerce lunch at Stones River Country Club. He also appeared at a function in Columbia later on where he addressed concerned General Motors workers and others about the future of the Spring Hill GM plant.\The Tennessee senator told the Murfreesboro audience he's concerned about children and grandchildren having to pay back what will end up being a $1 trillion debt when interest is counted.\Although some in Tennessee may benefit from a $4.2 billion cut of the stimulus package, Corker believes the legislation doesn't do enough to address the financial and housing issues that sparked the crisis.\""It's not going to fix the problem,"" Corker said.\Audience member Lee Moss, chief executive officer and chairman for Murfreesboro based Mid-South Bank, agreed.\""We're trying to solve the symptoms vs. the core issues,"" Moss said. ""Ultimately, until we find ways to provide adequate incentives to home buyers, we won't get the economy jumpstarted because it has to start with housing.""\Moss noted that the large banks are being careful with the loans to meet the requirements of federal regulators.\""I'd love to see Congress and regulators on the same page,"" Moss said.\Corker said part of the problem is that America's four largest banks are hoarding loans from Congress and former President George W. Bush. These institutions -- Bank of America, Citibank, Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan -- are hoping to stay afloat, but their reluctance to make the money available to others is hurting the economy, added Corker, who serves on the Senate's banking committee.\Audience member David Edwards, a Murfreesboro City Council member and a vice president and commercial lender at Middle Tennessee-based Pinnacle Financial Partners, agreed that these banks, which hold 38 percent of all assets in the country, are making it difficult for the financial market because of the bad debts they've taken on.\""They have to be very judicial,"" said Edwards, noting how negative consequences occur when major banks hoard money. ""It's a bit of a Catch-22.""\Corker also discussed his concerns about General Motors and Chrysler wanting more money from Congress and the president without taking steps to streamline costs.\""The only way for these companies to be successful is for shared sacrifice,"" said Corker, noting that the unions, managers and shareholders must be willing to accept cuts.\The senator also said he opposes a proposed ""Employee Free Choice"" bill that promotes unions recruiting enough new members to establish collecting bargaining power.\""To even call it that is crazy,"" said Corker, who'd rather keep the employee secret ballot process to determine if a factory or office will have union representation.\If unions can pressure employees to join, this will cause a major change in the balance of power between management and labor, Corker said.\""I'm fearful about what might happen,"" he said. ""It would set our country back decades.""\Corker also said he opposes a confusing cap and trade proposal being placed on carbon emissions from businesses in an effort to protect the environment.\""What it really is, is a tax on you,"" said Corker, noting the higher energy costs will be passed onto consumers at the gas pump or through their electric bills.\The senator instead favors a more transparent carbon tax that the government can't collect for revenues and must ""send every penny back to the American people."""

Tennessee's business and natural environment could improve if Congress adopts a new energy plan to limit carbon emissions linked with global warming and promote more nuclear and renewable energy production, a coalition of state business leaders said Thursday.
\
""There is no question that clean and renewable energy can result in a lot of job growth and have a major economic benefit for the valley,"" said former Tennessee Valley Authority Director Susan Richardson Williams, a former Tennessee Republican Party chairwoman who helped start Tennessee Business Leaders for a Clean Energy Tomorrow.
\
But other business groups suggest that congressional proposals to cap carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels only will drive up the cost of energy and hurt the economy.
\
""Utilizing the cap-and-trade solution for global warming to me is like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,"" said Deborah Woolley, president of the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ""It will reduce carbon emissions primarily by putting manufacturers out of business and people out of work.""
\
The business groups are fighting over a plan unveiled last week by U.S. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., to cap carbon emissions, create a trading system to allow utilities to use the market to reduce carbon releases and spur cleaner energy through a host of incentives, loan guarantees and research.
\
The measure will increase the costs of burning coal, oil and natural gas. But the tax on such emissions will be used to help consumers pay the expected increase in electricity bills and to encourage utilities and industry to use more nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal and biomass-generated energy.
\
A study by the Pew Charitable Trust found Tennessee ranked third in business growth in clean energy, reflecting the state's research and support of nuclear power, the landing of billion-dollar solar panel manufacturers last year in both Clarksville and Charleston, Tenn., and Nissan's plans to make battery-powered cars at its Smyrna plant. A federal lab for a spent nuclear fuel recycling center proposed in the Kerry-Lieberman bill could be located in Oak Ridge.
\
Ron Kenedi, vice president of Sharp Solar in Memphis, said his factory has grown from 320 employees to nearly 500 in the past year ""and we continue to grow as the U.S. market grows.""
\
While Tennessee is one of the top states for renewable energy businesses, the Volunteer State also has a disproportionate number of energy-intensive businesses drawn to the region by TVA's comparatively low energy costs. Such businesses will suffer -- and could decide to move out of the United States -- if electricity rates go up too much because of the new carbon tax, Ms. Woolley said.
\
But with growing global pressure to control carbon, supporters of the cap-and-trade legislation think it is important to send the right signals to the marketplace about the cost of carbon to spur new technologies.
\
""The landscape is going to change,"" said Jim Frierson, executive director for the Advanced Transportation Technology Institute in Chattanooga. ""Doing nothing is not an option anymore.""

83,"Staff Writer\With a green-colored Bible in one hand and his familiar red laser pointer in the other, former vice president and Nobel prize winner Al Gore led 2,500 Baptist preachers and lay leaders through his global warming slide show in Atlanta Thursday.\Sounding more like an evangelist than a politician, Gore drew upon Scripture, science and a Sunday school teacher from his home church to urge Baptists to do whatever they could to fight global warming.\""If we heap contempt on God's creation, that is inconsistent with glorifying God,"" he said.\Gore was in Atlanta to address a luncheon meeting at the New Baptist Covenant Celebration. Being held at the Georgia World Conference Center, the celebration has drawn more than 15,000 representatives from 30 racially, geographically and theologically diverse Baptist organizations. Organizers hope to rally Baptists around the agenda of Jesus, which they believe includes issues such as poverty and the environment.\After showing pictures of melting glaciers and stranded polar bears, Gore read from the Revised Standard Version of Isaiah 18:3: ""All you inhabitants of the world, you who dwell on the earth, when a signal is raised on the mountains, look! When a trumpet is blown, hear!""\Images of melting glaciers are ""a signal on the mountain"" for Christians, Gore said.\He called the global warming crisis ""a rising storm,"" similar to the rise of the Nazi party in the 1930s.\Instead of acting decisively, he said, politicians tried to talk their way out of the crisis, but they failed, he said.\Quoting from Winston Churchill, he said, ""the era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.""\He urges action, not talk\Gore asked his listeners, whether Republican or Democrat, to pressure presidential candidates to stop talking and act on global warming. When asked for specific suggestions, Gore told them to pressure politicians to approve a new global climate treaty and to push for a carbon tax.\As long as pollution is free, he said, ""the earth will be used like an open sewer.""\Robert Par ham, executive director of the Nashville-based Baptist Center for Ethics, called Gore a ""Baptist prophet."" In introducing Gore, Parham said, ""prophets are unacceptable because their truth is inconvenient.""\Todd Lake, vice president for spiritual development at Belmont University, said Gore had opened his eyes to the scale of global warming. ""Not only do we have a crisis, we have a mounting crisis.""\Lake, a self-described news junkie, says he has heard reports about rising carbon and melting glaciers. ""But those were all isolated incidents,"" he said. Gore's presentation, he said, helped him see the big picture on global warming.\Poverty given attention\Morning sessions at the convention focused on poverty.\Tony Campolo, author of Red Letter Christians, asked his audience ""which Jesus they believed in."" Is it a Jesus who looks like a middle-class American or the biblical Jesus who told a rich young ruler to sell all of his possessions and give them to the poor?\""Do you think Jesus really meant what he said, or was he only kidding?"" Campolo said.\Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund, pleaded with Baptists to stop what she called a ""cradle to prison pipeline"" that traps many poor children in America.\One of the first ways to do that, she said, is to make sure no child is left behind when it comes to reading. She urged churches to serve as role models for children and to do whatever it takes to teach children to read.\""Folks, if you can't read in this globalizing economy, you are sentenced to social death,"" she said. ""I cannot understand how we can break the genetic code and send a spaceship to Mars and a man to the moon and we can't figure out how to teach our children to read by fourth grade. What is wrong with us?""\Contact Bob Smietana at 259-8228 or bsmietana@tennessean.com."

If a bank is too big to fail, it's way too big to exist. If an oil well is too far beneath the sea to be plugged when something goes wrong, it's too deep to be drilled in the first place.
\
When are we going to stop behaving so stupidly? We nearly wrecked the economy and we're all but buried in debt. But we can't break up the biggest banks, and we can't raise taxes. Now we're fouling the magnificent Gulf of Mexico and ruining entire communities along the southern Louisiana coast.
\
And, by the way, we're still fighting a futile war in Afghanistan that we've been fighting with nonstop futility for nearly a decade.
\
For a nation that can't stop bragging about how great and powerful it is, we've become shockingly helpless in the face of the many challenges confronting us. Our can-do spirit was put on hold many moons ago, and here we are now unable to defeat the Taliban, or rein in the likes of BP and the biggest banks, or stop the oil gushing furiously from the bowels of earth like a warning from Hades about the hubris and ignorance that is threatening to destroy us.
\
BP and the Obama administration have been equally clueless about halting the millions of gallons of oil that have flowed into the gulf since the Deepwater Horizon explosion more than a month ago. President Barack Obama's top adviser on energy policy, Carol Browner, unintentionally underscored the monumental futility of the response in a comment she made on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
\
""This is obviously a difficult situation,"" Browner said, ""but it's important for people to understand that from the beginning, the government has been in charge.""
\
Got that? No one has been able to bring the crisis under control, and no one expects it to be brought under control soon, but the important thing for us to know is that the government has been in charge of this epic failure all along.
\
However and whenever the well gets capped, what we really need is leadership that calls on the American public to begin coping in a serious and sustained way with an energy crisis that we've been warned about for decades. If the worst environmental disaster in the country's history is not enough to bring about a reversal of our epic foolishness on the energy front, then nothing will.
\
The first thing we can do is conserve more. That's the low-hanging fruit in any clean-energy strategy. It's fast, cheap and easy. It's something that all Americans, young and old, can be asked to participate in immediately. In that sense, it's a way of combating the pervasive feelings of helplessness that have become so demoralizing and so destructive to our long-term interests.
\
People have talked about energy conservation for the longest time. But we have dawdled on making vehicles more fuel-efficient and weatherizing our homes and insisting that commercial buildings be more energy efficient, and so on. Turn those thermostats down a couple of degrees in the winter and up in the summer. We also need a carbon tax. The current crisis is the perfect opportunity for our political leaders to explain to the public why this is so important and what benefits would come from it.
\
Above all, I'd like to see the creation of a second Manhattan Project that would lead us in a few years to an environment in which alternative fuels are abundant, effective and affordable. We are a pathetically weak player in that game right now.
\
Instead of staring mesmerized at the tragedy in the gulf, like spectators at a train wreck, we should be trying to regain that innovative can-do spirit that made America the greatest of nations.
\
All around us is the wreckage of our failure to master the challenges confronting us. We see it in the many millions of Americans who remain out of work and whose hopes are not rising despite all the talk of economic recovery. We see it in the schools where teachers are walking the plank by the scores of thousands because of state and local budget problems.
\
We see it in the shrinking middle class and in the black community where depressionlike conditions are fostering not just a sense of helplessness, but despair.
\
What's needed is dynamic leadership (it doesn't have to come from the top) to reinvigorate the spirit of America and turn that sense of helplessness around.

The high hope that environmentalists once had held for the international meetings in Copenhagen this month to curb climate change almost surely are on the wane. Those hopes rode on President Obama's pre-election promise to make the United States a meaningful partner in reducing global warming gases, but he has now acknowledged that obstacles in the Senate will stall Washington's legislative advance. The expectation now is for modest progress this year, but hopefully enough to set the stage for more robust measures in a subsequent session next year.
\
To complicate matters, the conference is also slightly haunted by a new conspiracy theory ginned up by climate change naysayers following a round of scientists' e-mails obtained and distributed by a computer hacker.
\
Critics of initiatives to reduce global warming contend the e-mails show that the scientists involved would rig their evidence to make global warming appear more hazardous to the environment that it actually is. Though inappropriate and derisive of warming critics in parts, neutral observers who have studied the e-mails say they fall far short of the claims alleged against them.
\
One example is considered fairly illustrative: One scientists said in an e-mail that a graph showing climate heating trends could be altered by substituting actual thermometer measures where evidence from tree growth rings declined in a particular period. That may have been wrong, but it doesn't disprove the validity of other cumulative evidence from a virtual ocean of scientific work. It certainly does not suggest a larger scientific fraud regarding evidence of climate change that has been very well documented.
\
Indeed, the problem about global warming from manmade emissions is not that the Earth's physical trends are not documentable. Heat-withered croplands and forests, violent weather extremes, polar and high mountain glacial melt, rising oceans, globally threatened sea-coast communities and flood-prone low-lying nations -- all constitute readily observable and measurable trends in the warmest decade on record.
\
The problem is that the U.S. Congress, even more so than the European community, has wedded itself to an expensive and inefficient cap-and-trade plan on greenhouse gas emissions that is designed more to suit big businesses and lobbyists than the needs of the nation as a whole.
\
Opponents of the proposed U.S. cap-and-trade plan have reasonable grounds for skepticism. The plan would fix annually declining caps on greenhouse gas emissions and allow businesses to purchase continuing interim rights to emit pollution in excess of those standards from cleaner companies that exceed required annual reductions. It would also allow businesses to purchase certifiable offsets to carbon dioxide emissions through investments at home and abroad in projects designed to capture emissions, the principal greenhouse gas most commonly emitted by burning fossil fuels. Proof that such offset investments would not have otherwise occurred, however, is difficult to judge and prone to fraud.
\
Cap-and-trade is simply inferior to a tax on carbon emissions, the most direct and surefire way to obtain reductions in bad emissions. Big businesses, vehicle manufacturers, energy industries and, consequently, the politicians they lobby and whose campaigns they fund, are all averse to a carbon tax.
\
They have colluded to devise a system of tax credits (read, taxpayers subsidies), weak and flexible clean-up targets, cap-and-trade purchases and giveaway pollution voucher rights to polluting industries for an interim period, ostensibly to help businesses wind down pollution emissions. These vouchers and cap-and-trade credits and offsets would create a new $1 trillion market in assets that businesses and Wall Street traders could depreciate, sell or manipulate to offset future emission-control costs -- even as many businesses would leave pollution and carbon emission hot-spots in their communities intact and unabated.
\
Ordinary Americans, of course, ultimately would pay the pass-through costs for energy and goods produced by greenhouse emitters -- often without the direct benefit of cleaner air or fewer greenhouse gases in their immediate community. With these defects, controversy deservedly will continue. The only thing worse, for the United States and the world, is to have no concrete plan at all for reducing greenhouse gases.
\
For that reason, the talks in Copenhagen should go forward, especially now that India and China, which has just passed the United States as the world's leading greenhouse gas emitter, have agreed to the need for action. Without meaningful action in Washington and U.S. leadership, however, the talks in Copenhagen won't produce the kind of progress the world needs to avert a frightening level of global warming.

86,"The slow march to socialism in Washington has become an all-out dash.\In an effort to befuddle and bedazzle the American people, we have been subjected to endless comparisons to the Great Depression while they offer up the government as the only solution to all of our ills. The reality is, of course, this recession is not nearly as bad as the recession of 1982, and we all made it through that one just fine.\What makes this recession so different is the unprecedented response from the government. This ""stimulus"" package that's being foisted upon this country grows by the day. We now know that this bill contains mountains of pork; everything from $550 million for contraception to $150 million for honeybee insurance. To put it in perspective, this stimulus package is larger than the gross domestic product of Australia.\While we watch the looters trying to persuade us to break out the checkbook, they're trying to slip their slimy hands into our back pockets. One example is the cap-and-trade scheme coming out of the U.S. Senate. Barbara Boxer, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, is pushing for a carbon offset program for businesses. Industries would be limited to a certain amount of carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide is, of course, the harmless gas that we all exhale and plants use it to make oxygen. Instead of capping true pollution, Boxer and her colleagues are proposing capping CO2. Any company that went above the limits would have to buy offsets from companies that aren't over the limit. It's a way to redistribute corporate wealth. It makes as much sense as sin offsets or trash offsets. You can sin as much as you want or throw as much trash out the window as you like, as long as you pay someone else who's not doing it. It's a money grab, plain and simple.\Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., is proposing an alternative. He favors a carbon tax. This is where these same industries that go over the CO2 limit would pay a tax to the government. The government, ostensibly, would issue rebates to consumers who are directly affected by that particular industry raising its prices. Corker's heart is in the right place. He truly believes the Senate will pass something and he'd rather it be a tax that comes back to the people. But, there's a third option. Oppose it all!\I suggested to Sen. Corker that he point out that the earth has actually been cooling since 1998 and that a growing number of scientists are now changing their minds about manmade global warming. Corker doesn't want to fight them on the science; he wants to fight them on policy. But the science is what really matters.\Retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John Theon has now come out as a skeptic. Theon was James Hansen's boss at NASA. Hansen, of course, is the father of all this global-warming hysteria. Theon now admits that Hansen ""embarrassed NASA"" with all of his wild claims. Theon says, ""Climate models are useless. Thus, there is no rational justification for using climate model forecasts to determine public policy."" Yet, that's exactly what Boxer and the global-warming alarmists in Congress are doing.\I couldn't get an answer out of his office as to whether Corker believes in all this global-warming claptrap. If he doesn't, I can't see how creating a new tax on something that is, at best, inconclusive, is constructive.\It all comes down to a fundamental difference in principles. Either you believe the government is the solution to all of our economic woes, or you believe in the free market. Either you believe this global-warming nonsense, or you don't. There comes a time when our elected officials must vote based on their principles. These are not issues of compromise. These are issues where people of principle show us what they're made of. We're counting on the conservatives left in Washington to stop this socialist steamroller. Filibuster if you must, but take a stand.\Phil Valentine is an author and syndicated radio talk-show host heard locally on SuperTalk 99.7 WTN weekdays 4-8 p.m. His column appears in The Tennessean on Sundays.

87,"By SAM STOCKARD STOCKARD@DNJ.COM\-- Sam Stockard, 615-278-5165\From the environment to taxes to planning, Mayo Taylor doesn't shy away from taking on big issues.\She served on the Rutherford County Regional Planning Commission for 11 years and is now on the panel helping form a new planning document. She directed the group that backed a state income tax in Tennessee. But she is most widely known as an environmental advocate, serving as director of the Tennessee Environmental Council for 12 years and helping form what is now the Stones River Watershed Association.\Taylor sat down recently with The DNJ to talk about environmental issues.\Q: You recently visited The DNJ with a group that was backing the American Climate and Energy Act of 2009. Are you in favor of that bill and, if so, why?\Taylor: I am. It's hard to say what form it's going to be in when it finally gets through. But what that entire group is interested in is passage of legislation at the national level that will help provide incentives for businesses and individuals to take action for climate change, which is basically a large list of different types of actions. The whole thing about this climate change, everybody's aware of it now, and we all have to be aware there's no single big thing the country can do as a whole. It's going to be a lot of small steps by businesses, homes and individuals. And the cap-and-trade legislation, what that does is put a business-like approach to it for the business sector being able to buy and sell the right to emit carbon dioxide, basically. It's already been tested out pretty well with acid rain for nitrous oxide cap-and-trade, and now they're hoping to bring that over to the carbon dioxide.\Q: Opponents call the legislation and the cap-and-trade an energy tax that will hurt middle Americans and put people out of jobs. What is your answer to that?\Taylor: Well, there is support in parts of the environmental community for a straight carbon tax with the idea that if fossil fuels cost more, they will be used more carefully. What cap-and-trade tries to do is move off that model and instead use the trading of the ability to emit carbon dioxide to provide financial incentives to businesses to take actions that are going to save money over the long term. And so like with most things dealing with energy, it's taking that long-range look rather than just seeing short-term impact on fuel costs.\Q: Do you believe America's ready to change its reliance on gas and coal.\Taylor: I think we're getting very close to the point where we have no choice, and I do think the public understanding of the need for changes for energy formula is getting pretty strong. We've got a secretary of energy now that is completely committed to it and scientists have put out basically benchmarks that aren't too far out for points that we tip over and we really can't reverse the impacts of what we're doing with our fossil fuel. And so the policy makers have to provide the leadership, but I think the public is beginning to grasp the seriousness of the situation.\Q: You're a longtime member (former president) of the Stones River Watershed Association (It grew out of the Black Fox Wetlands League founded in 1990). How would this type of legislation affect water quality, or would it?\Taylor: Well, everything gets linked up when you start talking about environmental quality, but there's not a lot of direct link on that, although there have been some interesting cases. One that I'll cite is EPA gives awards to industries and communities for water efficiency, and they recently recognized Orange County, Calif., which is near where I grew up, for their water reuse program, and one of the factors was the money that was going to be saved in not having to pump water from northern California. The California aqueduct system is the biggest power user in California, among a lot of big power users, and this is a case in which water efficiency directly results in energy efficiency. And in smaller amounts, that applies all over the country. If we are more efficient in our water uses, less energy is involved in moving it and treating it.\Q: What is your biggest concern right now about the safety of the watershed here?\Taylor: I was on the county planning commission for 11 years, and I've seen the land use changes that have come to our county, and that has a lot of potential to impact our streams. Our streams are just vital living corridors through our communities, but they need protection. They've had benign neglect for a lot of years. As we are active around them, both for development and farming, we need to have a little bit more proactive ability to set some buffers so that they're not destroyed.\Q: Does the watershed association have a big initiative going right now?\Taylor: We do an interesting mix of recreation, education and some advocacy, and right now a lot of our energy is aimed at Boat Day, which is our big event for the year on July 11. And that's an opportunity for people to come out and get in boats on the river. We typically put about 350 people in boats that day, and the idea is that if they enjoy the river, they'll love the river. If they love the river, they'll want to see the river protected, and they'll understand the issues about river protection. And so it's kind of a building block approach, but that's our current energy sink right now.\Q: Of course, boats without motors?\Taylor: Oh yes, these are kayaks and canoes, but we have nothing against boats with motors, fishermen and so forth.\Q: As you said, you're a former member of the Rutherford County Regional Planning Commission, and you're also on the comprehensive plan steering committee (which is helping guide a new planning document). As a member of those, what can you do as a planner to protect the watershed?\Taylor: One of the things that has been ongoing over the last few years, the county and each of the three large municipalities have stormwater programs, and they're mandatory, and they are looking at a lot of applications that help with river protection. They're mapping all the stormwater outflows, they're enforcing riparian buffers, which is very critical, and I think our knowledge of our river corridors is coming along tremendously on that. There's also a whole science of best management practices developing as agencies work on these issues. We've become more knowledgeable about how best to remedy problems with our rivers and how to avoid new problems. It's kind of back to the energy, the Pew Charitable Trust just did a study that found Tennessee was in the top five nationally for what they call clean energy jobs, but they included in that and the basis for Tennessee being in there, was mitigation work. There's been a lot of remediation and environmental mitigation in Tennessee, and as a result of that we have this large growth of jobs in that industry, and I think we're seeing the same thing with protection of water.\Q: Do you have anything else you'd like to add?\Taylor: I think citizens of the state need to be alert to what's going on with our state Legislature, the recently-passed Clean Energy Futures Acts, which both Sen. (Jim) Tracy and Sen. (Bill) Ketron supported, and that puts Tennessee out there in a leadership position on building efficiencies. They need to be aware Tennessee is a leader in the clean energy sector. We've got Hemlock plant coming in up around Clarksville. ... There's just a lot going on with our state, and even though Tennessee's in rough shape, and we've got high unemployment, we've got a tremendous opportunity with clean energy technologies coming in.\Mayo Taylor, environmental advocate\Age: 59\Background: Raised in Elsinore, Calif.\Education: Elsinore Union High School, Class of '67; bachelor's degree University of California-Berkeley, 1971; Peabody College, library degree\Career: Vanderbilt University librarian; director of Tennessee Environmental Council; director of Tennessee Tax Project; faculty librarian at MTSU's James E.

88,"Tennessee Voices\Energy prices and the conflict in the Middle East, combined with growing concern over the progress of global warming, have jump-started a long-overdue national conversation about the direction of America's energy policy.\The public is clamoring for solutions and, in this generation, there has never been deeper support for increasing the amount of power we get from renewable energy.\America is the most technologically and economically advanced nation in the world, blessed with vast natural and intellectual resources and a skilled work force. Our nation has a track record of responding to major challenges and achieving unthinkable goals. If any nation in the world is capable of creating an energy system that can fuel our economy while preserving our environment and our long-term security, it is us.\But, right now, America is failing to take advantage of our almost unlimited potential to generate electricity from renewable sources of energy like wind and solar power.\The United States has historically been a leader in the deployment of renewable energy technologies. As recently as the mid-1990s, we were the world's leaders in solar power capacity and No. 2 in wind. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. By 2004, Japan had three times the solar photovoltaic capacity of the United States, while Germany had more than double the capacity. The U.S. is now third in installed wind-power capacity behind Germany and Spain.\Currently, Germany employs more than 40,000 workers in its wind energy industry and Denmark another 20,000. Both of these countries have wind resources that are only a fraction of those in our nation's windiest states. In Germany, the wind-energy industry is the second-largest consumer of steel next to the automotive industry.\Fortunately, an expanding number of communities are pressing the nation toward cleaner renewable energy. State and local officials are increasingly seeing the local economic development benefits of renewable energy. Farmers and ranchers recognize the benefits renewable energy provides for agricultural interests and rural economies. And, workers and businesses are beginning to understand that renewable energy technologies have the potential to create high-quality jobs that will drive our nation into the 21st century.\Already 25 states - from Texas in the South, to Minnesota in the North, to New Hampshire in the Northeast, Arizona in the Southwest and Washington State in the Northwest - have passed renewable energy standards of their own, committing nearly half of our country's population to renewable energy targets as high as 25 percent by 2020.\By creating guaranteed markets for renewable energy, these policies have helped to jump-start new statewide energy economies and we are seeing evidence of the economic benefits.\For example, Pennsylvania's clean energy standard has spurred investment by Gamesa, a large Spanish manufacturer of wind turbines, in four plants outside of Philadelphia to assemble wind energy equipment for use in the U.S. One thousand Americans have already gone back to work on the site of a former U.S. Steel mill outside of Fairless, Pa. And, this is but one of many examples of the boom in investments in clean energy jobs we are seeing across the country.\Developing our renewable energy resources will create jobs, save consumers money and bolster rural economies. A recent study the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) found that the national Renewable Electricity Standard which passed the House of Representatives this year requiring 15 percent of electric generation from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 would save consumers up to $18 billion on their electricity and natural gas bills in 2020 and that electricity bills would be lower in every state. A new report by the Blue Green Alliance and the Renewable Energy Policy Project found that renewable energy manufacturing could create 17,662 jobs in Tennessee.\In addition, by shifting away from fossil fuels, we can diversify and secure our energy supply while reducing global warming pollution. The UCS analysis based on assumptions of the Energy Information Administration indicates the House standard requiring 15 percent renewable electricity by 2020 would cut global warming pollution by 126 million metric tons by 2020; the equivalent of taking 20 million cars off the road.\Building on the momentum of the states, it is now time for Congress to act and pass a final energy bill that includes the renewable electricity standard. As the House and Senate work out the differences between their energy bills, it is critical that they include a renewable electricity standard of at least 15 percent. By supporting this legislation in the final energy bill, Sens. Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker can help build a cleaner and more secure economy for Tennessee, while reducing global warming pollution and making the U.S. once again the world's clean energy leader.\Stan Johnson is director of the United Steelworkers District 9 and Liz Schmitt is Southeast field organizer at Environment America, www.environmentamerica.org."

Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought - and several thousand gave their lives.\We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world. For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. Most of al Qaeda's top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home.\These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness, and teamwork of America's Armed Forces. At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They're not consumed with personal ambition. They don't obsess over their differences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together.\Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example. Think about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world in educating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we're in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren't so tied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.\We can do this. I know we can, because we've done it before. At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known. My grandfather, a veteran of Patton's Army, got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth.\The two of them shared the optimism of a Nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism. They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share - the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement.\The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. What's at stake are not Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. We have to reclaim them.\Let's remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren't, and personal debt that kept piling up.\In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn't afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people's money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn't have the authority to stop the bad behavior.\It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs. And we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect.\Those are the facts. But so are these. In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we've agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we've put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like that never happens again.\The state of our Union is getting stronger. And we've come too far to turn back now. As long as I'm President, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.\No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last - an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values.\This blueprint begins with American manufacturing.\On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world's number one automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.\We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back.\What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. We can't bring back every job that's left our shores. But right now, it's getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in fifteen years, Master Lock's unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.\So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back. But we have to seize it. Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed.\We should start with our tax code. Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it.\So let's change it. First, if you're a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn't get a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home.\Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here.\Third, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. If you're a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making products here. And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.\My message is simple. It's time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I'll sign them right away.\We're also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years. With the bipartisan trade agreements I signed into law, we are on track to meet that goal - ahead of schedule. Soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.\I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products. And I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules. We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration - and it's made a difference. Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires. But we need to do more. It's not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized.\Tonight, I'm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China. There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing finance or new markets like Russia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you - America will always win.\I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can't find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that - openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work.\That's inexcusable. And we know how to fix it.\Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College. The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training. It paid Jackie's tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant.\I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train two million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job. My Administration has already lined up more companies that want to help. Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, Orlando, and Louisville are up and running. Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers - places that teach people skills that local businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.\And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help they need. It's time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work.\These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier.\For less than one percent of what our Nation spends on education each year, we've convinced nearly every State in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning - the first time that's happened in a generation.\But challenges remain. And we know how to solve them.\At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced States to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies - just to make a difference.\Teachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let's offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. In return, grant schools flexibility: To teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren't helping kids learn.\We also know that when students aren't allowed to walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. So tonight, I call on every State to require that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn eighteen.\When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves middle-class families thousands of dollars. And give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years.\Of course, it's not enough for us to increase student aid. We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll run out of money. States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who've done just that. Some schools re-design courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better technology. The point is, it's possible. So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education can't be a luxury - it's an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.\Let's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: The fact that they aren't yet American citizens. Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else.\That doesn't make sense.\I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration. That's why my Administration has put more boots on the border than ever before. That's why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office.\The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let's at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, and defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away.\You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women should earn equal pay for equal work. It means we should support everyone who's willing to work; and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs.\After all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses. So let's pass an agenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year.\Innovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally-financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched. New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet. Don't gut these investments in our budget. Don't let other countries win the race for the future. Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries.\Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy. Over the last three years, we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I'm directing my Administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now, American oil production is the highest that it's been in eight years. That's right - eight years. Not only that - last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years.\But with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, oil isn't enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy - a strategy that's cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.\We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly one hundred years, and my Administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I'm requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.\The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of thirty years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock - reminding us that Government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground.\What's true for natural gas is true for clean energy. In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries. Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled. And thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.\When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance. But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it's hiring workers like Bryan, who said, ""I'm proud to be working in the industry of the future.""\Our experience with shale gas shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don't always come right away. Some technologies don't pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here. We have subsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough. It's time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's rarely been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that's never been more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits and create these jobs.\We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change. But there's no reason why Congress shouldn't at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven't acted. Well tonight, I will. I'm directing my Administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power three million homes. And I'm proud to announce that the Department of Defense, the world's largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history - with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year.\Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So here's another proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, and more jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that creates these jobs.\Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America's infrastructure. So much of America needs to be rebuilt. We've got crumbling roads and bridges. A power grid that wastes too much energy. An incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world.\During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our States with a system of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today.\In the next few weeks, I will sign an Executive Order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to fund these projects. Take the money we're no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home.\There's never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest-hit when the housing bubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren't the only ones hurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who've seen their home values decline. And while Government can't fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.\That's why I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates. No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won't add to the deficit, and will give banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.\Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a Government and a financial system that do the same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.\We've all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn't afford them. That's why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior. Rules to prevent financial fraud, or toxic dumping, or faulty medical devices, don't destroy the free market. They make the free market work better.\There is no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly. In fact, I've approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. I've ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don't make sense. We've already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next five years. We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill - because milk was somehow classified as an oil. With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.\I'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder. But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago. I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury pollution, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean. I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny you coverage, or charge women differently from men.\And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules. The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system's core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, start a business, or send a kid to college.\So if you're a big bank or financial institution, you are no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers' deposits. You're required to write out a ""living will"" that details exactly how you'll pay the bills if you fail - because the rest of us aren't bailing you out ever again. And if you're a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they can't afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices are over. Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job: To look out for them.\We will also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people's investments. Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there's no real penalty for being a repeat offender. That's bad for consumers, and it's bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing. So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.\And tonight, I am asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.\A return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help us protect our people and our economy. But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future.\Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile. People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year. There are plenty of ways to get this done. So let's agree right here, right now: No side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut without delay.\When it comes to the deficit, we've already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means making choices. Right now, we're poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.\Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else - like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans? Because if we're serious about paying down our debt, we can't do both.\The American people know what the right choice is. So do I. As I told the Speaker this summer, I'm prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.\But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of Members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes. Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule: If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes. And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires. In fact, if you're earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn't get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn't go up. You're the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. You're the ones who need relief.\Now, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense.\We don't begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it. When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich. It's because they understand that when I get tax breaks I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference - like a senior on a fixed income; or a student trying to get through school; or a family trying to make ends meet. That's not right. Americans know it's not right. They know that this generation's success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to their country's future, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility. That's how we'll reduce our deficit. That's an America built to last.\I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt; energy and health care. But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right now: Nothing will get done this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken.\Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical?\The greatest blow to confidence in our economy last year didn't come from events beyond our control. It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not. Who benefited from that fiasco?\I've talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street. But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad - and it seems to get worse every year.\Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics. So together, let's take some steps to fix that. Send me a bill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress, and I will sign it tomorrow. Let's limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact. Let's make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can't lobby Congress, and vice versa - an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington.\Some of what's broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days. A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything - even routine business - passed through the Senate. Neither party has been blameless in these tactics. Now both parties should put an end to it. For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days.\The executive branch also needs to change. Too often, it's inefficient, outdated and remote. That's why I've asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy so that our Government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people.\Finally, none of these reforms can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town. We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common sense ideas.\I'm a Democrat. But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That Government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more. That's why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and States. That's why we're getting rid of regulations that don't work. That's why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a Government program.\On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about Government spending have supported federally-financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home.\The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective Government. And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress. With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow. But I can do a whole lot more with your help. Because when we act together, there is nothing the United States of America can't achieve.\That is the lesson we've learned from our actions abroad over the last few years.\Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies. From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can't escape the reach of the United States of America.\From this position of strength, we've begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Ten thousand of our troops have come home. Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer. This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America.\As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana'a to Tripoli. A year ago, Qadhafi was one of the world's longest-serving dictators - a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he is gone. And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change can't be reversed, and that human dignity can't be denied.\How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain. But we have a huge stake in the outcome. And while it is ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well. We will stand against violence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings - men and women; Christians, Muslims, and Jews. We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.\And we will safeguard America's own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests. Look at Iran. Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran's nuclear program now stands as one. The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent. Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.\The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe. Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever. Our ties to the Americas are deeper. Our iron-clad commitment to Israel's security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history. We've made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope. From the coalitions we've built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we've led against hunger and disease; from the blows we've dealt to our enemies; to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back.\Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about. That's not the message we get from leaders around the world, all of whom are eager to work with us. That's not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin; from Cape Town to Rio; where opinions of America are higher than they've been in years. Yes, the world is changing; no, we can't control every event. But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs - and as long as I'm President, I intend to keep it that way.\That's why, working with our military leaders, I have proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I have already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing danger of cyber-threats.\Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it. As they come home, we must serve them as well as they served us. That includes giving them the care and benefits they have earned - which is why we've increased annual VA spending every year I've been President. And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our Nation.\With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we are providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets. Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families. And tonight, I'm proposing a Veterans Job Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her.\Which brings me back to where I began. Those of us who've been sent here to serve can learn from the service of our troops. When you put on that uniform, it doesn't matter if you're black or white; Asian or Latino; conservative or liberal; rich or poor; gay or straight. When you're marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails. When you're in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one Nation, leaving no one behind.\One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden. On it are each of their names. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But that doesn't matter. Just like it didn't matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates - a man who was George Bush's defense secretary; and Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for president.\All that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about politics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn't deserve credit for the mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job - the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs. More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other - because you can't charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there's someone behind you, watching your back.\So it is with America. Each time I look at that flag, I'm reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those fifty stars and those thirteen stripes. No one built this country on their own. This Nation is great because we built it together. This Nation is great because we worked as a team. This Nation is great because we get each other's backs. And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard. As long as we're joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong.\Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.\ID_Code: D4-120124018"

Haslam's original proposal seeks to index the gas tax to the Consumer Price Index, meaning the rate would fluctuate with inflation.\The amendments were necessary because Haslam's bill was a caption -- legislation that is written broadly enough to allow for changes.\After some discussion and confusion on the bill, the subcommittee voted 5-4, with Speaker Pro Tem Curtis Johnson, R-Clarksville, serving as the tie breaking vote, in favor of the amended Haslam proposal.\Because the Haslam bill was given approval in the subcommittee, it can be changed at any time, including in the full House Transportation Committee.\The amendments that were added to the Haslam bill could easily be removed and replaced with the entirety of Haslam's plan.\""This is the first step in a thorough legislative conversation about how we as a state pay for our roads and bridges,"" said Dave Smith, a spokesman for the governor.

Bob Corker of Tennessee, is at least getting a fresh look.\Corker and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., have proposed raising the federal gas tax by 12 cents over two years and indexing it to inflation. To make the concept more palatable to fiscal conservatives, the measure would lower other taxes.\The 18.4-cent-per-gallon gas tax hasn't been raised since 1993.

96,"WASHINGTON -- When Sen. Bob Corker proposed raising federal gas taxes this week, many around Capitol Hill couldn't decide if he showed political courage or political overreach.\Regardless, as Congress moves toward a summer debate over highway funding, Corker, R-Tenn., is drafting something most conservatives avoid at all costs - a tax bill.\The Tennessee senator, along with Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., want the 18.4-cents per-gallon federal gasoline tax and the 24.4-cents per-gallon federal diesel tax to each increase by 12 cents over the next two years - and then be indexed to inflation. If the gasoline tax had been increased based on inflation since the last hike in 1993, it would stand at 30 cents now, about where Corker wants to put it.\Corker and Murphy say the Federal Highway Trust fund needs the money if the country is to repair a rapidly deteriorating transportation system, especially its roads.\They emphasize higher fuel levies should be coupled with reductions in other taxes affecting businesses and families, so that the bottom line reads ""revenue neutral.""\Praise from many\In predictable Washington fashion, the praising - and sniping - hasn't taken long. Carter Eskew, the Democratic strategist behind Al Gore's 2000 presidential race, writing on The Washington Post's website, called it ""a move that truly passes for courage these days in the GOP ranks.""\Corker, who earlier this year got labeled a Republican ""contrarian"" by the newspaper Politico, won praise from other quarters as well.\""I think it is an act of common sense, which in our polarized environment passes for an act of political courage,"" said Cal Jillson, political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.\""Something has to be done (about highways).""\It's not like Corker is calling for higher income taxes, Jillson said, ""This is a user fee.""\Other supportive comments:\""It is time for our nation's leaders to stand with Senator Murphy, Senator Corker and others that support improving our country's transportation system,"" said Bob Darbelnet, president of the AAA.\""A well-designed, modern infrastructure enables the business activity that leads to economic growth, which is exactly why predictable, sustainable, growing sources of revenue are needed to support the federal Highway Trust Fund,"" said Janet Kavinoky of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\""Instead of sitting on their hands as they watch America's roads and bridges further deteriorate, Senator Murphy and Senator Corker have the courage to step up and offer a real solution,"" said former Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat.\Critics stand firm\Some in Tennessee's congressional delegation were more measured, if not downright critical.\""I will not agree to increasing user fees for roads until I first see, and decide I can support, the road program,"" said Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, who is running for re-election.\""Pay as you go is the conservative approach. If new roads are needed, there is nothing to keep other states from doing what Tennessee has done: raise state user fees and build roads without borrowing money.""\Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Brentwood, added: ""Washington doesn't have a revenue problem. Washington has a spending problem. Another tax increase on hard-working taxpayers is not the way to solve the Highway Trust Fund issue.""\And conservative interest groups say there is a lot of waste in highway spending.\""It's not an example of political courage to avoid reforming a broken system, instead of standing up to the special interests who feast on the chronically bankrupt Highway Trust Fund year after year,"" said Club for Growth President Chris Chocola.\""This is a $164 billion dollar tax increase, plain and simple.

The chamber has been lobbying for the local option.\When asked by an audience member what he thought the state could do in the future to provide assistance in terms of Middle Tennessee's transit needs, Haslam said the gas tax proposal would be an initial step in the right direction.\Although not going into great detail, Haslam admitted the state has a role to play in addressing the area's transportation needs.\At one point, the governor discussed the continuing economic boom that Nashville has seen in recent years, saying that he didn't think it was a ""bubble.""\""I think it's built on a solid foundation of a place with a dynamic economic environment and a place that people want to live,"" he said.\Haslam said the challenges for the area are ensuring there is ""great public education"" and transportation.\""Those are the only two kind of questions marks out there around Metro and Nashville and Middle Tennessee,"" he said.\Haslam's gas tax proposal is expected to be introduced in the legislature before the end of the week.\Joey Garrison contributed to this report.

100,"MURFREESBORO -- Three of the Tennessee General Assembly races in Rutherford County include competitive Aug. 4 Republican primaries.\The Daily News Journal asked the GOP candidates facing primary competition to respond to five questions. The unopposed Republicans and Democrats will be asked to respond to questions about the issues in advance of the Nov. 8 general election.\The other two races awaiting the general election are Republican state Rep. Dawn White of Murfreesboro facing Democrat Becky Goff of Murfreesboro for the the District 37 seat and Republican state Rep. Bryan Terry of Murfreesboro running against Democrat Justin T. Miller of Murfreesboro for 48th District seat.\Those in the competitive primaries answered questions through email about why voters should pick them, as well as what their positions were on the gas tax, school vouchers, Insure Tennessee and unfunded mandates. The order of those providing answers is based on the time the email responses arrived.\Tennessee House 49th District\State Rep. Mike Sparks of Smyrna faces a challenge from Rutherford County Board of Education member Aaron Holladay of La Vergne for the 49th District seat. The winner will then run against Democrat Brandon Thomas of Murfreesboro.\What is your position on Tennessee's gas tax when many contend this revenue is not keeping up with the cost for road projects?\Holladay: TDOT must first provide a listing of the projects that need to be funded. The governor must return the funds that were taken from TDOT in previous years when those funds were used to balance other areas in the state budget. Finally, Tennessee roads should be maintained at the highest levels while continuing to be debt free.\Sparks: I have been opposed to raising the gas tax or any new taxes, any increase in taxes only adds harm to our most vulnerable citizens, especially when we have the highest sales tax in the nation, roughly 10%. Tennessee has close to a billion dollar budget surplus the past year. Utilizing those excess tax dollars to meet our state's road needs, would be a priority-not raising more taxes and fees.\What is your position on Gov. Bill Haslam's Insure Tennessee proposal that accepts expanded Medicaid funding available from the Affordable Care Act to provide more health care coverage for low-income residents?\Holladay: Governor Haslam's Insure Tennessee proposal was, has been, and would remain D.O.A. in my mind. Any time when the best we can do is to be just like everyone else, we are on the wrong track. There is reason to examine the details of the new Tennessee Republican 3-Star Health proposal because it takes better care of our veterans, begins to address mental illness, and incorporates personal accountability for choices of healthy living.\Sparks: I, like many are not sold on InsureTN, but I am in favor of finding a conservative approach to insuring more of those who truly need it, while protecting taxpayer dollars. The speaker recently appointed a committee that is trying to do that now. Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, had to remove 350,000 people from the rolls of the existing state Medicaid program, TennCare, in order to avoid a budget crisis. We need to look for ways to expand access to healthcare, not expand a broken Obamacare system. The vast majority of my residents oppose expanding Obamacare in any form, even InsureTN.\Tennessee House 34th District\In the 34th District, four Republicans are running to succeed retiring state Rep. Rick Womick of Rockvale: Joshua James, Tim Rudd, Christy Sigler and Jimmy Turner, all of Murfreesboro.\The winner runs against Democrat Laura Bohling of Christiana.\What is your position on Tennessee's gas tax when many contend this revenue is not keeping up with the cost for road projects?\Rudd: I am opposed to any gas tax increase. We should use a portion of the state's large surplus to address any critical infrastructure and transportation issues. As a conservative, I don't believe we should increase the tax burden on hard-working Tennesseans.\Sigler: While Tennessee is generally well-situated financially, the road funds are not sufficient for the amount of work that needs to be completed. Traffic has become so severe on I-24 that often times people in Rutherford County have to choose between good jobs and time with their family. I believe that we need to better fund our road system but not on the backs of the taxpayer.\Turner: Our state has had a $1 billion surplus over the past 16 months in tax revenue. I think it's irresponsible for the state to ask citizens for more money if the government is already collecting more than it needs. I would support redirecting the surplus funds towards infrastructure funding with responsible parameters eliminating political influence for pet projects.\James: I don't support the idea of raising the gas tax. I do want to learn more on the subject, but before i would consider raising that tax I'd much rather they correctly used the money they already tax.\What is your position on the governor's Insure Tennessee proposal that accepts expanded Medicaid funding available from the Affordable Care Act to provide more health care coverage for low-income residents?\Rudd: I strongly oppose Obamacare and will continue to fight its implementation in Tennessee.\Sigler: I would rather Obamacare had never been passed or implemented. I intend to be a representative for the people of Rutherford County. I plan to hold several town hall and listening sessions on this issue and vote according to the will of the people.\Turner: I do not support this attempt to expand Obamacare in Tennessee. The argument that 'the federal government will fund a large portion of Insure Tennessee' is deeply flawed. The national debt is obscene. The federal government does not have the money to dole out for another expansion of government funded health insurance.\James: I think the governor is wrong. This close to a change in the White House it would be foolish to push a broken expensive system on the people. I think we need to stay the course and say no.\Tennessee Senate 14th District\The Republicans facing competition include state Sen. Jim Tracy of Shelbyville, and he's running against Steve Lane of Murfreesboro and Matt Randolph of Ardmore for the 14th District seat.\The winner will face Democrat Gayle Jordan of Murfreesboro.\What is your position on Tennessee's gas tax when many contend this revenue is not keeping up with the cost for road projects?\Lane: I believe we should have an external audit of TDOT to determine if there is an actual need for additional revenue. Next, we should CUT the State gas tax by $.05 per gallon and give counties the ""local option"", via voter referendum, of having up to a $.05 per gallon local gas tax. Everyone knows when you eliminate the middle man and buy furniture or other goods direct from the factory, you get a better deal. This would effectively be the same thing. I believe in local collection and control of road funding.\Tracy: Let me be clear: in a time when state budget surpluses are at an all time high, including an over-collection of almost $50 million on gas taxes alone last fiscal year, now is not the time to be putting an even higher tax burden on our citizens. Tennessee has always been a pay as you go state on road projects. One of the most critical components to economic development - and one of the most crucial roles of government - is to provide the infrastructure for our communities. Thanks in no small part to the tremendous success we've had at growing and creating jobs here in Middle Tennessee, our infrastructure is under strain. We need to eliminate wasteful spending in other areas of government and re-prioritize the dollars we already have before we ever consider raising taxes one cent.\Randolph: I believe that if the gas tax is meant to support the road system, and it is not keeping up with projects, then perhaps the system needs to be examined to see why and possible changes that may improve cost effectiveness.\What is your position on the governor's Insure Tennessee proposal that accepts expanded Medicaid funding available from the Affordable Care Act to provide more health care coverage for low-income residents?\Lane: I will not support any expansion of Medicaid. It's a broken system, how is spending more on it going to help? We need reform, not expansion. I would also like to eliminate all retirement and health insurance benefits for elected officials.\Tracy: We need to be reducing government entitlement programs, not adding to them. We cannot afford to bring Obamacare to Tennessee. Instead, I have been working with members from across the state to find conservative, free-market solutions to address access to healthcare challenges in our rural communities. Just this past session, we passed sweeping certificate of need reforms, making it easier for health-care providers to enter Tennessee and provide health care to citizens. It is solutions like this we need to be championing in state government, not looking for ways to re-brand Obamacare so that our taxpayers feel better picking up the tab.\Randolph: I do not like accepting federal funding from questionable sources like Obamacare. The more the federal government reaches into our lives, the more we become indebted to them.\What is your position on the governor's proposal to provide low-income families with vouchers to help pay for private school tuition for their children?\Lane: It obviously depends on the details, but generally speaking I support anything that will help put an end to the current government monopoly on education. Instead of bureaucrats and elected officials controlling educational spending, I want education dollars spent by principals, teachers, and of course, PARENTS.\Tracy: I support any method to increase access to quality education in Tennessee. Charter schools and opportunity scholarships help get children out of failing schools and in to educational environments that they can thrive and grow in, especially in inner-city Memphis. Public education is supposed to be the great equalizer, helping all get the same start upon high school graduation. We have not, however, made sure that each child has had access to the quality of education that would make this a reality. Charter schools and opportunity scholarships need to be one of the tools in the tool chest to make that happen.\Randolph: I do not have an issue with families sending their children to better schools to improve their chances on getting a better education.\Contact Scott Broden at 615-278-5158.

In the spring of 1986, former Gov. Lamar Alexander unveiled a grand plan to build a series of new highways.
\
The jewel of the plan was a 77-mile road branching off of Interstate 40 in Wilson County, looping south, and then reconnecting to I-40 in Dickson County.
\
I-840, as it was called then, was expected to take $351 million and 10 years to build.
\
Those estimates are running about $100 million too low and about 10 years too early.
\
So far only 24 miles have been completed -- from I-40 west of Lebanon to Interstate 24 near Murfreesboro -- at a cost of more than $208 million, according to Tennessee Department of Transportation statistics.
\
Estimates also show that to complete the other 53 miles through Rutherford, Williamson, Hickman and Dickson counties, the state will spend an additional $245 million.
\
Although the difference between what was estimated in 1986 and the actual cost looks enormous, TDOT officials say the higher cost is something that happens all of the time.
\
``Basically, when this was being proposed, the state pretty much went on the basis of $5 million per mile,'' said TDOT information director Luanne Grandinetti. ``But, 10 years later and after you begin the project, costs usually always go up.''
\
Materials, inflation, environmental studies, and the overall landscape are all pushing the cost of the project higher, Grandinetti said.
\
Barry Sulkin, one of the founders of the Not 840 Coalition opposed to a proposed northern loop of the highway, says the state officials who approve the plans for building roads should take time to run studies on any proposed highway program, before they throw out a general cost estimate.
\
Although Sulkin did not see the original budget for state Route 840, the budgets he has seen from the state Transportation Department have not shown cost estimates for tangible items and other materials.
\
``The finished product may be right because of the pavement and all, but to build it to protect the environment, for example, means it costs more, particularly with mountain grades and other factors,'' said Sulkin, an environmental consultant. ``But, that's not usually in an original budget.
\
``There is no real hard thinking involved in this, and had there been . . . it may not have been approved,'' he added.
\
State Route 840 was one of the main projects unveiled in the waning days of Alexander's administration in 1986.
\
Gas tax driving new road
\
The project was one of six highway construction proposals that made up Alexander's $3 billion ``Bicentennial Parkways,'' which are designed to ease traffic congestion on the three main interstate arteries into Nashville: I-40, I-24 and I-65.
\
Alexander won approval of a 3-cent increase on the gasoline tax to pay for construction of the roads.
\
After Alexander's departure from office, his successor, Gov. Ned McWherter, considered scrapping the project.
\
But after lengthy discussions with Alexander, he decided to build the Route 840 as originally planned, and said the southern 840 loop would be completed by the state's bicentennial celebration in 1996.
\
That target date has long since passed and the work continues.
\
Back in 1986, the state's General Assembly had wanted to have the project completed by the end of fiscal year 1999. However, the abundance of projects since then and the extra time and money the southern portion of 840 has cost have pushed the completion date into the next century, Grandinetti said.
\
``We had a number of shifts on our priority list, regarding highway projects, and that is one of the reasons why we are looking at a longer time schedule for completing the work,'' Grandinetti said.
\
Funding for the project has also been an issue over the 11 years since its conception. In 1989, McWherter passed legislation increasing the gas tax another 4 cents to pay for the additional costs of the project, which has been a ``comfortable'' level as the construction continues.
\
Grandinetti said she does not anticipate any further gas tax increases to pay for the project's completion.
\
Eight more years
\
Construction continues on the second leg of the highway, from I-24 to I-65, and engineering and structural studies proceed for the final leg from I-65 to I-40.
\
Completing the southern portion of the project may be close to eight years away, Grandinetti said, but much depends on securing the last of the rights-of-way along the proposed route from I-65 west and northwest to I-40.
\
State Transportation officials are also focusing their attention on the proposed northern loop of 840, which would run through Wilson, Sumner, Robertson, Montgomery and Dickson counties and complete the circle.
\
Supporters of the northern loop argue it will spur economic development in the outlining cities and towns north of Nashville, while opponents claim the cost of the highway to the state's coffers and the communities the road will go through won't be worth the hoped for benefits.

"
102,"CORRECTION APPENDED\Most, if not all of it, should be borne by the industry that's causing the issue, frankly.""\Dick Williams\Common Cause Tennessee\After taking office, Gov. Bill Haslam reconstituted an obscure board that enforces environmental rules for the industry that helped make him the richest elected official in America.\Since then, the Underground Storage Tank and Solid Waste Disposal Control Board has taken steps to shift the financial burden of cleaning up toxic spills at gas stations and truck stops from business owners to taxpayers.\The 14-member board, 12 of whom are appointed by the governor, sets rules for the $50 million environmental fund overseen by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, or TDEC. The fund has been paying to clean up spills since 1990. It is financed by a combination of a gas tax paid by consumers at the pump and an annual fee paid by owners of petroleum tanks.\Since the board has been reconfigured, members representing consumers have been eliminated.\The board, which retained its four petroleum industry members, has since voted in favor of a resolution to increase the state dollars available to private companies for environmental spills caused by failures or accidents from $1 million to $2 million. That became law in 2015.\This year, a new law gives the board the power to give all gas stations and truck stops a big break -- suspending their annual fees to the cleanup fund entirely. Some board members have signaled their support for eliminating those fees this year -- despite hearing from the man in charge of the state's underground storage tank program that a ""historically high burden of this funding has shifted onto the public.""\Suspending the industry's financial contributions would leave taxpayers, who haven't gotten the same breaks as gas stations and truck stops, holding the entire tab for toxic spills.\Tennessee drivers continue to shoulder most of the cost of petroleum spills at Pilot Flying J, Chevron, Exxon and other companies, large and small, through a one-fourth of a cent per gallon gas tax that added up to about $18 million last year. Companies contribute about $2 million in fees each year.\The fund has paid out millions to private petroleum companies since it began operating in 1990, including $10 million to Pilot Flying J, the Haslam family truck stop chain worth an estimated $33 billion. The governor continues to hold an undisclosed financial stake in the company.\A spokeswoman for Haslam noted that the governor took steps to consult with counsel before restructuring the board to ensure there was no conflict of interest. The new structure was proposed by TDEC, said Jennifer Donnals, the spokeswoman.\""The governor has never suggested any measures at the request of his family or his family's company, and any insinuation or suggestion otherwise is factually incorrect and a disservice to your readers,"" Donnals said.\""Because at times the board intersects with his family's company, the governor talked with legal counsel before proposing the restructure.""\Even before the reconstitution of the board, members who had been appointed before Haslam took office voted to cut industry fees, Donnals noted.\Board member George Hyfantis acknowledged that members of the public bear a large share of the cleanup costs -- a proportion that will increase if the board votes to suspend industry fees.\But it is a step Hyfantis said he and his colleagues are considering taking, he said, as long as they believe it will not jeopardize the health of the fund.\The industry in 2004 ponied up $10 million to prop up the fund as it teetered on the verge of insolvency, with more than 1,200 tanks requiring remediation. Hyfantis said he wanted the board to return some of that money to the companies that paid it.\""We have been having discussions about whether we need that much money in the fund,"" said Hyfantis, citing the fund's roughly $48 million balance, which accountants have said is already obligated for approximately 283 current and all future spills. ""We would like to be able to get some of that $10 million back to tank owners that contributed way back when.""\Citizen advocates like Dick Williams, who is chairman of Common Cause Tennessee, question why taxpayers should be subsidizing the costs of environmental accidents and failures at filling stations.\""Most, if not all of it, should be borne by the industry that's causing the issue, frankly,"" he said.\Storage tank controversy in 2011\When he first campaigned for statewide office, Haslam pledged to abstain from any matters involving Pilot Flying J if elected governor.\Soon after taking office in 2011, however, Haslam faced public controversy when he issued a blanket suspension of all pending state rules and regulations -- including a new rule that would have cost Pilot Flying J hundreds of thousands of dollars to retrofit or replace gas tanks to be double-walled to meet new Environmental Protection Agency standards.\At the time, Haslam said he wasn't aware of the specifics of any of the rules he suspended. The required double-wall rule went into effect a few weeks later.\Then in 2012, Haslam successfully passed legislation that reconfigured the board overseeing gas tanks -- a step he took to consolidate many boards across state government.\It was part of an effort, he said, that would streamline government and make it more customer focused. The old board had met fewer than half the times it was scheduled in 2009, 2010 and 2011, his spokesman noted.\The new board eliminated two consumer representative slots.\Representatives of the Tennessee Fuel and Convenience Store Association, the Tennessee Petroleum Council and of two private petroleum companies remain on the 14-member board, which also includes representatives from county and local governments and an environmental representative.\The board oversees rules and regulations of the program, which was started in 1988 after new EPA rules designed to protect people from the toxic effects of oil leaks were put in place. The EPA counts petroleum tank leaks as one of the biggest polluters of the nation's drinking water.\Those EPA rules required gas station and truck stop owners to be able to demonstrate $1 million in financial responsibility in the event tanks leaked. But private liability insurance to pay for the leaks was difficult to obtain for small mom-and-pop gas stations, so some 35 states, including Tennessee, created funds that serve as insurance. In these states, taxpayers largely serve as the insurers in the event of an environmental leak.\The fund allows small gas stations to remain open, which is especially important in rural areas where gas station and convenience store access may be limited, said Emily LeRoy, executive director for the Tennessee Fuel and Convenience Store Association, which supports suspending fees for private industry to give back to the industry the money they used to bail out Tennessee's fund in 2004.\""All around the nation, people are concerned that there are not enough retail locations for the public. We don't want to get into the position where we have a lot of fuel deserts -- or food deserts,"" LeRoy said. ""A lot of these smaller retail locations serve areas that are underserved by food stores.""\The gas tax on consumers and the fees charged to industry should be seen as more of a ""user fee"" for consumers who need gas and the station owners, she said. ""Everybody uses fuel. It's an important commodity, and I think that's one reason we view this as a user fee for everyone who participates in the system.""\Of the larger multimillion-dollar or multibillion-dollar chains that operate in the state and still collect millions from the fund, LeRoy said that the tank fund is set up to apply to every business owner equally.\""That would require some sort of discrimination, and I'm not sure how you would set that up, and it's not how the fund is set up,"" she said.\A spokesman for TDEC noted that the agency has saved nearly $20 million since 2009 by buying its own cleanup equipment, instead of reimbursing companies that buy their own.\Taxpayers pay the biggest share\Since the year before Haslam took office, the portion of contributions from gas stations and truck stops in the cleanup fund has decreased by nearly half -- shifting more of the burden to taxpayers.\In 2010, companies were contributing nearly 19 percent of the annual fund contributions. By 2015, their share was down to 10 percent, leaving taxpayers to contribute the remaining 90 percent.\The contributions have decreased in part because there are 1,306 fewer tanks in the state this year than there were in 2005, according to data provided by Stan Boyd, director of the Division of Underground Storage Tanks.\They also decreased because the board -- after Haslam took office but before his reorganization of state boards -- voted to cut the amount of annual fees paid by industry in half, further reducing their contribution.\Currently tank owners pay $125 per tank to be eligible for up to $2 million from the state each to clean up the environment each time a tank leaks. The ceiling was previously set at $1 million, but proposed legislation by TDEC to raise it was passed by lawmakers in 2015. Raising the limit was based on inflation data that showed the steep climb in cleanup costs since the fund was created, according to TDEC.\When the newly appointed board began debating reducing or eliminating fees even more, Boyd -- who has directed the program for 12 years -- noted that ""a historically high percentage of this funding has shifted to the public"" and advised against it. Boyd urged ""thoughtful consideration before making changes to the fee structure.""\But the board has moved forward with plans to eliminate the petroleum industry's financial contribution to the state fund.\This year, at the request of the Tennessee Fuel and Convenience Store Association -- which has a designee on the board TDEC introduced legislation to give the board the new authority to completely eliminate fees.\At their last meeting in July, TDEC's staff attorney requested board members wait until the end of 2016 before they contemplated eliminating the fees entirely.\They meet again in October. No agenda has yet been made public.\Reach Anita Wadhwani at 615-259-8092 and on Twitter @AnitaWadhwani.\Paying to clean up spills\A gas tax is paid by consumers to provide funds to clean up potential toxic spills.

103,"Most, if not all of it, should be borne by the industry that's causing the issue, frankly.""\Dick Williams\Common Cause Tennessee\After taking office, Gov. Bill Haslam reconstituted an obscure board that enforces environmental rules for the industry that helped make him the richest elected official in America.\Since then, the Underground Storage Tank and Solid Waste Disposal Control Board has taken steps to shift the financial burden of cleaning up toxic spills at gas stations and truck stops from business owners to taxpayers.\The 14-member board, 12 of whom are appointed by the governor, sets rules for the $50 million environmental fund overseen by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, or TDEC. The fund has been paying to clean up spills since 1990. It is financed by a combination of a gas tax paid by consumers at the pump and an annual fee paid by owners of petroleum tanks.\Since the board has been reconfigured, members representing consumers have been eliminated.\The board, which retained its four petroleum industry members, has since voted in favor of a resolution to increase the state dollars available to private companies for environmental spills caused by failures or accidents from $1 million to $2 million. That became law in 2015.\This year, a new law gives the board the power to give all gas stations and truck stops a big break — suspending their annual fees to the cleanup fund entirely. Some board members have signaled their support for eliminating those fees this year — despite hearing from the man in charge of the state's underground storage tank program that a ""historically high burden of this funding has shifted onto the public.""\Suspending the industry's financial contributions would leave taxpayers, who haven't gotten the same breaks as gas stations and truck stops, holding the entire tab for toxic spills.\Tennessee drivers continue to shoulder most of the cost of petroleum spills at Pilot Flying J, Chevron, Exxon and other companies, large and small, through a one-fourth of a cent per gallon gas tax that added up to about $18 million last year. Companies contribute about $2 million in fees each year.\The fund has paid out millions to private petroleum companies since it began operating in 1990, including $10 million to Pilot Flying J, the Haslam family truck stop chain worth an estimated $33 billion. The governor continues to hold an undisclosed financial stake in the company.\A spokeswoman for Haslam noted that the governor took steps to consult with counsel before restructuring the board to ensure there was no conflict of interest. The new structure was proposed by TDEC, said Jennifer Donnals, the spokeswoman.\""The governor has never suggested any measures at the request of his family or his family's company, and any insinuation or suggestion otherwise is factually incorrect and a disservice to your readers,"" Donnals said.\""Because at times the board intersects with his family's company, the governor talked with legal counsel before proposing the restructure.""\Even before the reconstitution of the board, members who had been appointed before Haslam took office voted to cut industry fees, Donnals noted.\Board member George Hyfantis acknowledged that members of the public bear a large share of the cleanup costs — a proportion that will increase if the board votes to suspend industry fees.\But it is a step Hyfantis said he and his colleagues are considering taking, he said, as long as they believe it will not jeopardize the health of the fund.\The industry in 2004 ponied up $10 million to prop up the fund as it teetered on the verge of insolvency, with more than 1,200 tanks requiring remediation. Hyfantis said he wanted the board to return some of that money to the companies that paid it.\""We have been having discussions about whether we need that much money in the fund,"" said Hyfantis, citing the fund's roughly $48 million balance, which accountants have said is already obligated for approximately 283 current and all future spills. ""We would like to be able to get some of that $10 million back to tank owners that contributed way back when.""\Citizen advocates like Dick Williams, who is chairman of Common Cause Tennessee, question why taxpayers should be subsidizing the costs of environmental accidents and failures at filling stations.\""Most, if not all of it, should be borne by the industry that's causing the issue, frankly,"" he said.\CREDIT: Anita Wadhwani"
104,"By Lisa Fingeroot | The Tennessean\The world's first Leaf electric limousine led about 60 other electric and hybrid cars in a Nashville-area parade Sunday that marked the second annual National Plug In Day.\At the end of the route, at a newly opened public charging station at Vanderbilt University, electric car owners and enthusiasts were met with supportive remarks from a state official.\Tennessee is being recognized as one of the most ""plug in ready"" locations in the nation, said Toks Omishakin, assistant commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Transportation.\""You don't get a lot of political points for supporting things like this. Not yet,"" Omishakin said. But he believes time will change that attitude.\Starting with Gov. Bill Haslam, state officials are very supportive of both the overall environmental benefit of plug-in vehicles and the long-term economic benefit to electric car owners, Omishakin said. But as more drivers switch to electric vehicles, state officials say they will have to find another way to replace revenues currently generated by the gas tax.\A gas tax of 21.4 cents per gallon is how drivers currently support the roads they use. Some ideas are being discussed, but Omishakin said officials are not ready to make any statements about the possible options.\Nashville was just one of about 50 cities around the nation on Sunday to draw attention to plug-in electric vehicles. The effort is sponsored by Plug In America, the Sierra Club and the Electric Auto Association.\Nissan played a large role in the event by hosting a rally at its headquarters in Franklin, which was also the starting point of the parade that traveled to Vanderbilt's charging station at Broadway and 21st Avenue South.\State will benefit\The parade was open to any electric car owner and included models not made by Nissan, which plans to soon begin Leaf manufacturing in Smyrna. The car is currently manufactured overseas.\Since Tennessee will benefit economically from the manufacturing of electric cars, there have been no complaints about the state's support of the industry, Omishakin said.\The new charging station at Vanderbilt is the result of a collaboration between the Electric Power Research Institute and the Tennessee Valley Authority, which is installing 36 charging spots in Nashville, Chattanooga, Memphis and Knoxville.\Vanderbilt continues to own the parking lot in which the charging units are placed. Those who want to use the charging stations simply pay to park in a plug-in spot, said Ken Altman, the city captain for Nashville's Plug In Day.\Contact Lisa Fingeroot at 615-259-8892 or LFingeroot@Tennessean.com.

105,"Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam gave me an exclusive one-on-one interview about his statewide transportation tour that launched in Memphis on Wednesday.\That morning we met in his conference room in the state Capitol in downtown Nashville.\The Tennessean editorial board has directed a lot of its energy on issues of transportation and transit, given the growing attractiveness of Nashville and, consequently, the growing congestion.\Efforts across the community have focused on issues of mobility, from the Nashville MTA and Middle Tennessee RTA's nMotion strategic road map on transit to the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce's recently launched ""Moving Forward"" initiative. This year's Williamson Regional Outlook had a great focus on transportation, and regional transportation solutions were central to the June 18 Power of Ten regional summit sponsored by Cumberland Region Tomorrow.\Mobility is a critical issue to growth, economic development and quality of life in Middle Tennessee.\While the governor said he is not ready to roll out a solution, the tour will give him and Tennessee Department of Transportation Commissioner John Schroer the chance to find out what local communities consider their needs, present what the state thinks are the needs in those communities and get a sense of the costs associated with those needs.\Given the dwindling revenue from the gas tax, which hasn't been raised since 1989 -- while fuel economy has improved and labor and road material costs have increased -- and the lack of a long-term federal transportation funding bill in a decade, Haslam said ""the state's problem is one of math"" and Tennessee cannot continue on this road.\Find an abridged transcript of the interview between Haslam and me below. You can listen to the 12-minute podcast of the interview on this subject at Tennessean.com/opinion.\Plazas: The main purpose of this conversation is to talk about your upcoming transportation tourand to see whether you can give us any details.\Haslam: You know, infrastructure is not that always that well understood in Tennessee mainly because of how we pay for it. Because the infrastructure, because roads and bridges and funding for that and other methods of transportation don't come through the general fund budget -- they go through TDOT's budget -- people aren't necessarily aware of both the size and the scope of what we do at TDOT.\TDOT's budget is about $2 billion a year. But with that the backlog of projects that are needed -- and these projects aren't just wanted, but are needed -- is really large.\The issue we have in Tennessee is this: We pay for all that infrastructure when we buy gas or diesel at the pump.\So, the good news is that in the last 26 years, we all get a lot better fuel mileage than we did then. That's good for the economy, it's good for the environment.\But the bad news part of that is that means that because you pay for roads on a cents-per-gallon basis, everybody's using less fuel, literally people are paying a lot less for roads and bridges than they did 20-plus years ago. So, the state's problem is one of math.\As people get better mileage in their cars and trucks, the funding to pay for those roads goes down. Unfortunately, the cost of asphalt and engineers has not gone down. That's the dilemma.\Plazas: Tennessee has been a ""pay-as-you-go"" state historically and you have this multimillion-dollar surplus. Would there be any thought to bonding that out to really maximize that especially with $8 billion in unfunded projects?\Haslam: I would not be in favor of bonding transportation needs for this reason: We've been the beneficiary of people who abided by ""pay-as-you-go"" that came before us. So, we're not having to live with road debt. We're not having to pay interest on something that someone else did 20 years ago. It's a huge benefit.\Not only do we have the state situation, but you add to that the feds (Congress) haven't passed a bill in a long time. That means our fed funding has gone down as well.\Some of the states that have big road debt -- almost all of their money is going to pay interest on that road debt now. While it's tempting to do that when things get tight, I don't think it would be wise to leave the path that we've been on.\Plazas: What is the message that you hope to send?\Haslam: I think that ultimately the path we're on now won't work.\The CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards that will be required for new vehicles by the EPA for 10 years from now, new vehicles will have to average 50 miles per gallon.\Now that's really good news. That will be good for the environment, it will mean people spending less at the pump, etc., but the reality is that means that much fewer money going to address our infrastructure needs.\Then you add to that the feds haven't passed a program and that we have a lot of aging bridges and roads, it quickly becomes a safety issue.\Plazas: Have you thought about a starting date as to when you could start moving on the project and so forth?\Haslam: The other thing I'm not certain we have a great appreciation of there is how long the planning time is.\If tomorrow we had the funding for a road project that everybody thought was needed and we began working on it, we're probably seven years away from finishing that. It's just a long process to acquire the right of way, get the design, get it built.\If we change the way we fund roads, it won't really impact anything while I'm in office because the lead time is too long.\So somebody told me, ""Why are you doing all this?"" The state can't keep going like we're doing now. So somebody has to address it.\Plazas: It's an interesting thing, at the Williamson Regional Outlook a few months ago, that was the No. 1 issue that was talked about. One of the panelists said, ""Someone needs a big, bold idea."" Are you that person to bring that big, bold plan?\Haslam: That's a really good question. My first just job is to look at transportation things all across the state. And so my sense is Nashville's idea, that the big, bold idea -- first of all, it's not an easy one.\Mayor (Karl) Dean has worked really hard to come up with some things and, obviously, they haven't been able to. That's no fault of his. It's just hard.\It's hard for two reasons: No. 1: As a city becomes fully developed, it's hard to come up with alternative transportation means. No. 2: The federal money is gone.\All that being said, I think there's a consensus in Nashville and the surrounding environs, we've gotta do something.\Contact The Tennessean Opinion Engagement Editor David Plazas at 615-259-8063, dplazas@\tennessean.com or via Twitter at @davidplazas.\Thinkstock Images\david\plazas\3 reasons for the tour\Listen to what local residents think the needs are.\Present a list of what the state thinks the needs are.\Get an idea of the costs.\Transportation funding\The state's 2014-15 transportation budget is $1.837 billion.

106,"Let the road work begin.\Amid escalating traffic gridlock, and despite a difficult state spending environment that was portrayed to all of us close to a year ago by Gov. Bill Haslam's chief transportation officer, there is some roadwork that, by contract with Hankook Tire, has to happen regardless of the budget.\Mainly, getting part of Rossview Road widened.\As The Leaf-Chronicle has been reporting for many months, the state is on track to launch its portion of community preparations for Hankook - a more-accommodating road system, and in the meantime the Regional Planning Commission recently approved a preliminary plat for the site of the new city Fire Rescue and county Emergency Medical Services stations that will serve the $800 million South Korean-owned tire plant.\With Bell & Associates Construction as the principal contractor, TDOT plans to widen state Highway 237 (Rossview Road) to a five-lane roadway, from west of Interstate 24 to east of International Boulevard. In its official description, TDOT says this change calls for the removal and replacement of the existing bridges over the interstate.\Improvements will also be made to the I-24 on- and off-ramps and curb and gutter sections along Rossview Road. Traffic signals at International Boulevard and the interstate ramps are included in construction. The widening improvements will ""provide additional turning and storage space for vehicles entering or leaving the proposed development site,"" says TDOT.\The $12.9 million project was let to construction in October 2014 and is expected to be completed by May 2016. In preparation for construction, portable barrier rails have been installed along the inside and outside shoulders of I-24, in both directions, to provide workers a safe work zone.\TDOT says motorists can expect lane closures, lane shifts, and slow-moving traffic during construction. Workers and equipment will be on-site seven days a week, with nighttime and weekend lane closures possible. Drivers are urged to ""use caution, reduce speed, and be alert to changing traffic conditions in this area,"" said the state.\The current Park & Ride facility located within the project limits will remain in use during construction. ""A new location is currently being studied and will be developed prior to the end of the project,"" state officials said.\Other road projects\As we all know, the Rossview Road project is just one of several transportation needs that Clarksville-Montgomery County has, but some of the others might come at a much slower pace given the state's funding picture.\Recently, the County Commission backed these proposed projects in an official listing of requests to the state Legislature:\Construction phase of state Highway 374/Warfield Boulevard from Dunbar Cave Road to Stokes Road, at a projected cost of $22.8 million.\Engineering and environmental study phase for state Highway 48/Trenton Road from state Highway 13/Wilma Rudolph Boulevard to state Highway 236/Tiny Town Road, at a projected $1.5 million.\Construction phase for state Highway 48/13 from Zinc Plant Road to River Road on state Highway 149, at an estimated $23 million.\The sooner all of this roadwork can be done, the better ... but the likelihood of a quick fix runs counter to what TDOT Commissioner John Schroer told us last February.\In a presentation to the Clarksville Urbanized Area Metropolitan Planning Organization, Schroer said TDOT funding sources are drying up to the point that no new road projects will be started in 2015 (other than contractual work such as that promised to Hankook). Schroer told the regional transportation planning body that TDOT is using whatever creative strategies it can employ to stretch highway construction dollars where they are most needed across 95 Tennessee counties.\Part of the problem, Schroer maintains, is TDOT's revenue stream. TDOT is the only state agency that doesn't get money from the state's general fund.\Half of TDOT's departmental dollars come from the federal gas tax, and, in total, state transportation actually only has about a half-billion dollars available per year to spend on an $8.5 billion statewide road project backlog.\Tennessee is also one of only four states that has no transportation debt, an admirable feat, but Schroer maintains that it's getting harder and harder to administer a pay-as-you-go state in transportation. Hence some of the recent conversation in government circles about possibly raising the gas tax.\So far we've heard of very little pushback from this tax increase proposal. It will be interesting to see in the coming year if continued delays in highway improvements reach a pivotal point, changing the minds of many who've staunchly opposed increasing the gas tax in the past.\Consider this: Tennessee imposes 21.4 cents in taxes per gallon of fuel. The federal gas tax, which hasn't changed since 1993, is 18.4 cents per gallon, meaning drivers in Tennessee pay a total of 39.8 cents on each gallon of gas purchased.\The state portion provides an estimated $658 million a year and, according to Schroer, costs the average driver less than $300 a year. He said Tennessee has the 13th-lowest gas tax among the 50 states.\During TDOT's recent budget hearing, Schroer said Tennessee is becoming a ""maintenance-only state"" when it comes to transportation projects. His department earlier this year delayed 12 construction projects and 21 right-of-way acquisitions totaling $400 million because of uncertainty over federal funds.\Clarksville-Montgomery County is among the delayed counties, and the need here, as everyone knows, is reaching critical status.\Jimmy Settle, 245-0247\Business editor\jimmysettle@theleafchronicle.com\Twitter: @settle_leaf\jimmy settle"
107,"""If we're going to be responsible\to future generations, we're going to have to have\a mechanism\to really put a plan in place.""\Gov. Bill Haslam\State and local leaders gathered Wednesday morning to listen to Gov. Bill Haslam discuss where the area's transportation needs lie.\The issue? Tennessee's roads are improved upon and paid for almost entirely out of the state and federal gas tax, something that hasn't been added to in years.\The state's gas tax hasn't been raised since 1989, and the federal tax hasn't been raised in a decade. With more fuel-efficient vehicles on the road, the state is receiving fewer funds to maintain roads as costs continue to rise.\Cheaper fuel costs mean everyone wins except organizations like the Tennessee Department of Transportation, who are trying to fix the roads, Haslam said.\""That's great for the environment and it's great for keeping money in people's pockets, but the reality is the cost of roads is continuing to go up, and we can't think, 'Oh, we're going to have less and less money to cover a problem that keeps getting bigger and bigger and it'll balance out,'"" Haslam said. ""That math just doesn't work, so we have to address that.""\The result is $6 billion worth of backlogged projects for the state. Haslam said the state hasn't accepted any large projects in two years, until something can be done.\Haslam is traveling the state to get a pulse of the different areas, and to have a talk-back session to see what local leaders have to say.\Widening Interstate 40 with new, improved interchanges along the U.S. 45 Bypass and fixing the entrance to the Casey Jones Village are two of the projects mentioned that are being held up in West Tennessee. Together they cost an estimated $131.1 million, money the state doesn't have.\""There's not a project we've talked about that everybody says, 'We don't need to fix that interchange, we don't need to fix the area in front of Casey Jones,'"" Haslam said. ""Nobody says that anywhere.""\However, finding a way to get funding for projects like these will be difficult.\Haslam said his trip across the state isn't meant to gather support for a gas tax increase. He shuffled around questions about it Wednesday, but he said something has to be done.\""The issue becomes this, at some point in time we have to decide if we're going to do what Washington does and just keep kicking the can down the road ... If we're going to be responsible to future generations, we're going to have to have a mechanism to really put a plan in place,"" Haslam said.\Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris, a Republican from Collierville, wasn't at Wednesday's meeting, but he told The Jackson Sun he isn't ready for a gas tax discussion because it isn't the most important issue.\Norris said leaders need to talk to constituents to see what their transportation concerns are. Talking about a gas tax could divert from the importance of having the foundation discussion, he said.\""I don't want loose talk about a gas tax hike in 2016 to overshadow that dialogue,"" Norris said. ""We've got a lot more studying and discussion to do before we get to that point.""\Haslam said the state is one of five that is a ""pay as you go"" state, meaning the state has no debt in its highway fund.\Since there currently is no debt to add to, House Minority Leader Craig Fitzhugh, a Democrat from Ripley, said the state could look into financing some of the projects by going into debt with bonds with low interest rates.\Norris said other ways of adding to the highway fund have been suggested such as using the state's surplus funds and taxing electric cars.\However it is paid for, Bart Walls, chief administrative officer of the Madison County Highway Department, said his office desperately needs more funds. He said his office has been in ""maintenance mode"" because they don't have enough funds.\""We're not doing new projects because we don't have the money to do new projects,"" Walls said.\Reach Tyler at (731) 425-9629.

111,"After taking office, Gov. Bill Haslam reconstituted an obscure board that enforces environmental rules for the industry that helped make him the richest elected official in America.\Since then, the Underground Storage Tank and Solid Waste Disposal Control Board has taken steps to shift the financial burden of cleaning up toxic spills at gas stations and truck stops from business owners to taxpayers.\The 14-member board, 12 of whom are appointed by the governor, sets rules for the $50 million environmental fund overseen by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, or TDEC. The fund has been paying to clean up spills since 1990. It is financed by a combination of a gas tax paid by consumers at the pump and an annual fee paid by owners of petroleum tanks.\Since the board has been reconfigured, members representing consumers have been eliminated.\The board, which retained its four petroleum industry members, has since voted in favor of a resolution to increase the state dollars available to private companies for environmental spills caused by failures or accidents from $1 million to $2 million. That became law in 2015.\This year, a new law gives the board the power to give all gas stations and truck stops a big break -- suspending their annual fees to the cleanup fund entirely. Some board members have signaled their support for eliminating those fees this year -- despite hearing from the man in charge of the state's underground storage tank program that a ""historically high burden of this funding has shifted onto the public.""\Suspending the industry's financial contributions would leave taxpayers, who haven't gotten the same breaks as gas stations and truck stops, holding the entire tab for toxic spills.\Tennessee drivers continue to shoulder most of the cost of petroleum spills at Pilot Flying J, Chevron, Exxon and other companies, large and small, through a one-fourth of a cent per gallon gas tax that added up to about $18 million last year. Companies contribute about $2 million in fees each year.\The fund has paid out millions to private petroleum companies since it began operating in 1990, including $10 million to Pilot Flying J, the Haslam family truck stop chain worth an estimated $33 billion. The governor continues to hold an undisclosed financial stake in the company.\A spokeswoman for Haslam noted that the governor took steps to consult with counsel before restructuring the board to ensure there was no conflict of interest. The new structure was proposed by TDEC, said Jennifer Donnals, the spokeswoman.\""The governor has never suggested any measures at the request of his family or his family's company, and any insinuation or suggestion otherwise is factually incorrect and a disservice to your readers,"" Donnals said.\""Because at times the board intersects with his family's company, the governor talked with legal counsel before proposing the restructure.""\Even before the reconstitution of the board, members who had been appointed before Haslam took office voted to cut industry fees, Donnals noted.\Board member George Hyfantis acknowledged that members of the public bear a large share of the cleanup costs -- a proportion that will increase if the board votes to suspend industry fees.\But it is a step Hyfantis said he and his colleagues are considering taking, he said, as long as they believe it will not jeopardize the health of the fund.\The industry in 2004 ponied up $10 million to prop up the fund as it teetered on the verge of insolvency, with more than 1,200 tanks requiring remediation. Hyfantis said he wanted the board to return some of that money to the companies that paid it.\""We have been having discussions about whether we need that much money in the fund,"" said Hyfantis, citing the fund's roughly $48 million balance, which accountants have said is already obligated for approximately 283 current and all future spills. ""We would like to be able to get some of that $10 million back to tank owners that contributed way back when.""\Citizen advocates like Dick Williams, who is chairman of Common Cause Tennessee, question why taxpayers should be subsidizing the costs of environmental accidents and failures at filling stations.\""Most, if not all of it, should be borne by the industry that's causing the issue, frankly,"" he said.\Storage tank controversy in 2011\When he first campaigned for statewide office, Haslam pledged to abstain from any matters involving Pilot Flying J if elected governor.\Soon after taking office in 2011, however, Haslam immediately faced public controversy when he issued a blanket suspension of all pending state rules and regulations -- including a new rule that would have cost Pilot Flying J hundreds of thousands of dollars to retrofit or replace gas tanks to be double-walled to meet new Environmental Protection Agency standards.\At the time, Haslam said he wasn't aware of the specifics of any of the rules he suspended. The required double-wall rule went into effect a few weeks later.\Then in 2012, Haslam successfully passed legislation that reconfigured the board overseeing gas tanks -- a step he took to consolidate many boards across state government.\It was part of an effort, he said, that would streamline government and make it more customer focused. The old board had met fewer than half the times it was scheduled in 2009, 2010 and 2011, his spokesman noted.\The new board eliminated two consumer representative slots.\Representatives of the Tennessee Fuel and Convenience Store Association, the Tennessee Petroleum Council and of two private petroleum companies remain on the 14-member board, which also includes representatives from county and local governments and an environmental representative.\The board oversees rules and regulations of the program, which was started in 1988 after new EPA rules designed to protect people from the toxic effects of oil leaks were put in place. The EPA counts petroleum tank leaks as one of the biggest polluters of the nation's drinking water.\Those EPA rules required gas station and truck stop owners to be able to demonstrate $1 million in financial responsibility in the event tanks leaked. But private liability insurance to pay for the leaks was difficult to obtain for small mom-and-pop gas stations, so some 35 states, including Tennessee, created funds that serve as insurance. In these states, taxpayers largely serve as the insurers in the event of an environmental leak.\The fund allows small gas stations to remain open, which is especially important in rural areas where gas station and convenience store access may be limited, said Emily LeRoy, executive director for the Tennessee Fuel and Convenience Store Association, which supports suspending fees for private industry to give back to the industry the money they used to bail out Tennessee's fund in 2004.\""All around the nation, people are concerned that there are not enough retail locations for the public. We don't want to get into the position where we have a lot of fuel deserts -- or food deserts,"" LeRoy said. ""A lot of these smaller retail locations serve areas that are underserved by food stores.""\The gas tax on consumers and the fees charged to industry should be seen as more of a ""user fee"" for consumers who need gas and the station owners, she said. ""Everybody uses fuel. It's an important commodity, and I think that's one reason we view this as a user fee for everyone who participates in the system.""\Of the larger multimillion-dollar or multibillion-dollar chains that operate in the state and still collect millions from the fund, LeRoy said that the tank fund is set up to apply to every business owner equally.\""That would require some sort of discrimination, and I'm not sure how you would set that up, and it's not how the fund is set up,"" she said.\A spokesman for TDEC noted that the agency has saved nearly $20 million since 2009 by buying its own cleanup equipment, instead of reimbursing companies that buy their own.\Taxpayers pay the biggest share\Since the year before Haslam took office, the portion of contributions from gas stations and truck stops in the cleanup fund has decreased by nearly half -- shifting more of the burden to taxpayers.\In 2010, companies were contributing nearly 19 percent of the annual fund contributions. By 2015, their share was down to 10 percent, leaving taxpayers to contribute the remaining 90 percent.\The contributions have decreased in part because there are 1,306 fewer tanks in the state this year than there were in 2005, according to data provided by Stan Boyd, director of the Division of Underground Storage Tanks.\Reach Anita Wadhwani at 615-259-8092 and on Twitter @AnitaWadhwani.\Paying to clean up spills\A gas tax is paid by consumers to provide funds to clean up potential toxic spills.

113,"There are serious problems with the per mile tax system the Senate Transportation Committee has been discussing.\The first and most glaring issue presented, noted in a related article, is that car drivers who own vehicles with better fuel economy will pay more. The converse is also true: Drivers of vehicles with poor fuel economy will pay less.\For example, assume two vehicles each travel 15,000 miles in a year, one an SUV that averages 15 miles per gallon, and the other a compact hybrid that averages 30 miles per gallon. Under the current system whereby a consumer pays 21.4 cents per gallon of gas, the SUV consumes 1,000 gallons of gas, totaling $214 a year in gas tax. Likewise, the hybrid consumes 500 gallons of gas, requiring the driver to pay a total of $107 per year in gas tax.\Facing the same facts under the proposed system, assuming that Tennessee's per mile rate will be Oregon's 1.2 cents per mile, the drivers of the SUV and hybrid will each pay $180 in mileage tax per year. Accordingly, the hybrid driver will have to pay $73 more per year, while the SUV driver pays $34 less. This transition will have one inescapable result: As the gas mileage rate decreases, tax savings increase; as miles per gallon increase, so does the amount of additional tax.\The environmental issues this conclusion raises are significant. There is a long tradition of our government using its powers of taxation to not only raise revenue, but also to encourage positive behavior. However, changing the system as proposed will not only fail to provide an incentive to drive a vehicle that consumes less gas, it will actually offer a cash reward for consuming more gasoline while driving fewer miles. While the debate about greenhouse gases and global warming rage, no one asserts burning more gasoline is an environmentally neutral act. Changing the gas tax to a mileage tax will be a strong legislative statement regarding the importance of the environment to the state of Tennessee.\Further, taxing consumption of miles rather than gasoline may raise federal constitutional questions. For example, how will the issue of miles driven outside Tennessee be resolved? If a Tennessee resident drives to Los Angeles and back, and the GPS device tells the pump that she has driven 5,000 miles since the last fill-up, will she have to pay the $50 in mileage tax? What about the former Tennessee resident just passing through who fills up within Tennessee's borders for the first time in a year? Or the over-the-road trucker who lives in and is incorporated in Tennessee, but drives less than 5 percent of his annual mileage within Tennessee? These questions illustrate the challenges facing the nexus between a mileage tax and the place where the miles were actually driven. With a gas tax, the nexus is clear: The consumer purchases gas inside Tennessee's borders, thereby subjecting himself to the consumption tax on gasoline.\Finally, the General Assembly should think about the ancillary consumer costs that Tennessee residents will have to face. The automobile manufacturers will pass their costs for installing the required GPS devices onto the consumers, thereby increasing the cost of purchasing a new car. Also, retail gasoline sellers will pass the costs of installing the required equipment, as well as the administrative costs of collecting and tracking the mileage tax (which will have nothing to do with the amount of gas actually sold) onto their consumers. This will ultimately have the result of increasing the costs to Tennessee residents by substantially more than what will be received into Tennessee's coffers. This will be a very inefficient method of raising revenue.\The fiscal problems facing the Department of Transportation are very real, because its costs continue to increase, while its tax base has remained static and per vehicle gasoline requirements fall. But replacing the gas tax with a mileage tax in the manner proposed is impractical, possibly illegal and very inefficient. o\Randy Bampfield is a Nashville attorney. E-mail: jrbampfield@comcast.net."
114,"Staff Writer\A plan for the state to spur use of an ethanol blend of gasoline - by paying for an 8-cent-a-gallon consumer discount - is running out of gas on Capitol Hill.\The subsidy would have cost the state $6 million a year. Ethanol is a corn-based fuel, and the subsidy was proposed by friends of the industry.\Air-quality benefits of ethanol were touted in committee meetings, but state officials were less than optimistic. The tight state budget also has hurt the proposal's progress.\The plan was for participating service stations to offer the 8-cent-per-gallon discount to consumers buying a 10% ethanol blend of gasoline known as E-10.\State Sen. Don McLeary, D-Humboldt, is sponsoring the bill because it would help corn farmers in his district. The other sponsor is Republican Rep. Jamie Hagood of Knoxville. Knoxville and the nearby Great Smoky Mountains have had an ozone-related pollution problem.\The state Department of Environment and Conservation hasn't embraced the proposal, saying the fuel alternative does not offer the perfect solution to the state's high ozone levels, which are contributing to poor air quality.\Ozone, a pollutant and lung irritant, is the reason 27 Tennessee counties, including Davidson, are on the hot seat with the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which is scheduled to decide April 15 whether those counties have ozone levels high enough to fail certain air-quality standards.\E-10 ""does not hurt nor does it help"" efforts to meet air-quality standards, said Quincy Styke III, deputy director for the state air pollution control division.\The ethanol blend reduces carbon monoxide, Styke said, but he added that carbon monoxide is not a problem in Tennessee.\The state Environment Department is instead focused on emissions testing of vehicles in areas that fail to meet air-quality standards, spokesman David Owenby said.\A higher blend of ethanol, 85%, has been shown to reduce nitrogen oxide, a precursor to ozone. One service station in Nashville sells E-85, and only certain newer model vehicles can take the blend. It's at Spring and Main streets.\Gov. Phil Bredesen is not engaged in discussions on the ethanol bill but is keeping an eye on a federal energy bill that includes a similar initiative, spokeswoman Lydia Lenker said.\""Governor Bredesen is environmentally conscious about issues involving cleaner-burning fuels that lead to cleaner air. It's an important issue to him,"" she said.\In Tennessee, McLeary - the sponsor of the subsidy bill - acknowledges that $6 million is a lot of money in a year when health care and education needs are higher priorities.\""I don't want to bring in something that takes the focus away from health care and education, but this would certainly be a benefit to Tennessee's air and the farmers,"" said McLeary, who grows corn and soybeans on his own farm.\McLeary expects to have amendments to the bill ready for the Senate Environment Committee to consider Wednesday.\He initially proposed paying for the program by reducing the gas tax on E-10. But the tax break has drawn opposition from the Tennessee Roadbuilders Association because gas-tax money would be diverted from road projects.\State Sen. Jeff Miller, R-Cleveland, chairman of the Senate Environment Committee, said he expects E-10 efforts will stall this year without the support of Bredesen or the road builders.\Oil marketers are divided on the issue.\Pilot Oil Co. is pushing the measure to clean up the air and increase its market share by selling the ethanol blend at the discounted price, said Bill Nolan, a Pilot lobbyist. Already, about 18 metropolitan areas, including Denver and several in California and Minnesota, use ethanol, Nolan said.\He said reductions of any kinds of toxic substances would help the air and protect the health of Tennesseans.\But big companies represented by the Tennessee Petroleum Council - Exxon, BP and Marathon Oil - say they don't want to bear the cost of transporting ethanol, which must be trucked because it can't run through gas pipes.\""There's not an adequate supply of ethanol in Tennessee, and we're not hearing any of our customers say they really, really want to buy it,"" said the Tennessee Petroleum Council's Mike Williams.\Williams was skeptical of the bill as an economic development tool because it does not require all the corn to be Tennessee grown, nor the plants to be in state.\SB 2664/HB 3067 can be tracked at www.legislature.state.tn.us.\Bonna de la Cruz covers politics.

115,"""Most, if not all of (spill cleanup), should be borne by the industry that's causing the issue, frankly.""\Dick Williams\Common Cause Tennessee\After taking office, Gov. Bill Haslam reconstituted an obscure board that enforces environmental rules for the industry that helped make him the richest elected official in America.\Since then, the Underground Storage Tank and Solid Waste Disposal Control Board has taken steps to shift the financial burden of cleaning up toxic spills at gas stations and truck stops from business owners to taxpayers.\The 14-member board, 12 of whom are appointed by the governor, sets rules for the $50 million environmental fund overseen by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, or TDEC. The fund has been paying to clean up spills since 1990. It is financed by a combination of a gas tax paid by consumers at the pump and an annual fee paid by owners of petroleum tanks.\Since the board was reconfigured, members representing consumers have been eliminated.\The board, which retained its four petroleum industry members, has since voted in favor of a resolution to increase state dollars available to private companies for environmental spills caused by failures or accidents from $1 million to $2 million. That became law in 2015.\This year, a new law gives the board the power to give all gas stations and truck stops a big break -- suspending their annual fees to the cleanup fund entirely. Some board members have signaled their support for eliminating those fees this year -- despite hearing from the man in charge of the state's underground storage tank program that a ""historically high burden of this funding has shifted onto the public.""\Suspending the industry's financial contributions would leave taxpayers holding the entire tab for toxic spills.\Tennessee drivers continue to shoulder most of the cost of petroleum spills through a one-fourth of a cent per gallon gas tax that added up to about $18 million last year. Companies contribute about $2 million in fees each year.\The fund has paid millions to private petroleum companies since it began in 1990, including $10 million to Pilot Flying J, the Haslam family truck stop chain worth an estimated $33 billion. The governor continues to hold an undisclosed financial stake in the company.\A spokeswoman for Haslam noted the governor took steps to consult with counsel before restructuring the board to ensure there was no conflict of interest. The new structure was proposed by TDEC, said Jennifer Donnals, the spokeswoman.\""The governor has never suggested any measures at the request of his family or his family's company, and any insinuation or suggestion otherwise is factually incorrect and a disservice to your readers,"" Donnals said. ""Because at times the board intersects with his family's company, the governor talked with legal counsel before proposing the restructure.""\Even before the reconstitution of the board, members who had been appointed before Haslam took office voted to cut industry fees, Donnals noted.\Board member George Hyfantis acknowledged that the public bears a large share of cleanup costs -- a proportion that will increase if the board votes to suspend industry fees.\But it is a step Hyfantis said he and his colleagues are considering taking, he said, as long as they believe it will not jeopardize the health of the fund.\The industry in 2004 ponied up $10 million to prop up the fund as it teetered on the verge of insolvency, with more than 1,200 tanks requiring remediation. Hyfantis said he wanted the board to return some of that money to the companies that paid it.\""We have been having discussions about whether we need that much money in the fund,"" said Hyfantis, citing the fund's roughly $48 million balance, which accountants have said is already obligated for approximately 283 current and all future spills. ""We would like to be able to get some of that $10 million back to tank owners that contributed way back when.""\Citizen advocates like Dick Williams, chairman of Common Cause Tennessee, question why taxpayers should be subsidizing the costs of environmental accidents and failures at filling stations.\""Most, if not all of it, should be borne by the industry that's causing the issue, frankly,"" he said.\Storage tank controversy in 2011\When he first campaigned for statewide office, Haslam pledged to abstain from any matters involving Pilot Flying J if elected governor.\Soon after taking office in 2011, however, Haslam immediately faced public controversy when he issued a blanket suspension of all pending state rules and regulations -- including a new rule that would have cost Pilot Flying J hundreds of thousands of dollars to retrofit or replace gas tanks to be double-walled to meet new Environmental Protection Agency standards.\At the time, Haslam said he wasn't aware of the specifics of any of the rules he suspended. The required double-wall rule went into effect a few weeks later.\In 2012, Haslam successfully passed legislation that reconfigured the board overseeing gas tanks -- a step he took to consolidate many boards across state government to streamline government and make it more customer focused.\The new board eliminated two consumer representative slots.\Representatives of the Tennessee Fuel and Convenience Store Association, the Tennessee Petroleum Council and of two private petroleum companies remain on the 14-member board, which also includes representatives from county and local governments and an environmental representative.\The board oversees rules and regulations of the program, which was started in 1988 after new EPA rules designed to protect people from the toxic effects of oil leaks were put in place. The EPA counts petroleum tank leaks as one of the biggest polluters of the nation's drinking water.\Those EPA rules required gas station and truck stop owners to be able to demonstrate $1 million in financial responsibility if tanks leaked. But private liability insurance to pay for the leaks was difficult to obtain for small mom-and-pop gas stations, so some 35 states, including Tennessee, created funds that serve as insurance. In these states, taxpayers largely serve as the insurers in the event of an environmental leak.\The fund allows small gas stations to remain open, which is especially important in rural areas where gas station and convenience store access may be limited, said Emily LeRoy, executive director for the Tennessee Fuel and Convenience Store Association, which supports suspending fees for private industry to give back to the industry the money they used to bail out Tennessee's fund in 2004.\Of the larger multimillion-dollar or multibillion-dollar chains that operate in the state and collect millions from the fund, LeRoy said the tank fund is set up to apply to every business owner equally.\Taxpayers pay the biggest share\Since the year before Haslam took office, the portion of contributions from gas stations and truck stops in the cleanup fund has decreased by nearly half. In 2010, companies were contributing nearly 19 percent of the annual fund contributions. By 2015, their share was down to 10 percent, leaving taxpayers to contribute the remaining 90 percent.\The contributions have decreased in part because there are 1,306 fewer tanks in the state this year than there were in 2005, according to data provided by Stan Boyd, director of the Division of Underground Storage Tanks.\They also decreased because the board -- after Haslam took office but before his reorganization of state boards -- voted to cut the amount of annual fees paid by industry in half.\Currently tank owners pay $125 per tank to be eligible for up to $2 million from the state each to clean up the environment when a tank leaks. The ceiling was $1 million, but proposed legislation by TDEC to raise it was passed by lawmakers in 2015. Raising the limit was based on inflation data that showed the steep climb in cleanup costs since the fund was created, according to TDEC.\This year, at the request of the Tennessee Fuel and Convenience Store Association -- which has a designee on the board -- TDEC introduced legislation to give the board the new authority to completely eliminate fees.\TDEC's attorney asked board members to wait until the end of 2016 before they contemplated eliminating the fees entirely.

116,"ERIN, Tenn. -- The state comptroller says one of the major challenges for lawmakers and government officials in Nashville is keeping taxes low while providing services.\Comptroller Justin P. Wilson recently visited with members of the Erin Rotary Club during their monthly meeting.\""So the question becomes, how do you deliver services while at the same time, keep the values of people in Tennessee and the environment of low taxes?"" he said.\Wilson, whose duties include auditing the finances of all 95 counties and their municipalities, said Tennessee is known as a low-tax, low-debt state that operates with a balanced budget.\""In Tennessee, we think the money coming in should be the same as what goes out,"" he said.\Another duty of his office is to ensure that the state budget is ""actually balanced.""\Because the state operates primarily on sales taxes -- a state income tax is banned by the state constitution -- paying for the four major needs does not leave very much excess money for discretionary spending.\""There's always something money can be spent on,"" Wilson added.\Education receives be biggest piece of the spending pie, followed by health care and public safety. Next is transportation, though it is not nearly as much as the top three, which composes 93 to 94 percent of the state budget, he said.\With so little money left for other needs, legislators face ""many tough decisions,"" the comptroller said.\""We have a lot of problems here in Tennessee that need to be addressed and are being addressed,"" he said. The top four spending areas ""are where most of the problems are, and the Legislature is addressing them aggressively.""\Wilson mentioned a ""Common Sense Caucus,"" of which freshman Rep. Jay Reedy is a member, that has emerged in the Legislature and is tackling major issues.\""They don't forget where they come from,"" he said. ""They have the fundamental values the people of Tennessee like and appreciate.""\Revenues\The comptroller said one of the biggest problems with the state budget is federal money that is coming in.\""We distributed almost as much federal money as we do state tax dollars,"" Wilson said, adding that federal requirements come with each federal dollar regarding how it can be spent.\Conversely, when state lawmakers consider accepting federal money, he said that beyond recognizing values are different in Washington than Nashville, they also ""can't be sure what the requirements will be and will that same money always be there?""\Wilson said about 59 percent of the state's revenue comes from sales taxes, while about 18 percent is from corporate/franchise taxes. About 2 to 3 percent is taxes on investment income, and another 2 to 3 percent comes from business-related taxes like a tax on mixed drinks. The remainder is derived from various fees and taxes.\In response to a question about the tax on investment dividends, commonly known as the Hall tax, Wilson said it remains on the books, but lawmakers repealed the portion of the law that taxed inheritance.\While it is a ""highly unpopular tax,"" primarily because it affects many elderly people, the Hall tax generates about $280 million for the state each year.\Wilson was also asked about the state's gas tax, which is 19 cents per gallon, in addition to a federal gas tax.\The gas tax, which is earmarked for highway construction and maintenance, enables Tennessee to be one of four or five states that have no highway debt.\Although the tax does not fluctuate up or down according to gas prices, the amount the state has collected in recent years had decreased because of higher mileage vehicles.\Wilson thinks raising the gas tax will become a major issue over the next two to four years.\""You can raise a lot of money with just a small increase per gallon,"" he said.\Mark Hicks, 289-3345\Multimedia Journalist\mhicks22@gannett.com\Twitter: @markhicksleaf"

120,"As the Tennessee Department of Transportation looks to spend new revenue from the gas tax increase approved by the legislature in 2017, it's hit a speed bump: the state's water quality regulations.\State environmental regulators are hoping to change the rules so that TDOT — which has a history of water quality violations — and real estate developers will have less trouble obtaining permits when they want to divert a stream, pave over wetlands or otherwise alter the state's waterways.\The proposed rule changes would stipulate where developers can mitigate damage done to streams, and would establish a baseline for pollution or alterations from which any harm would have to be offset. Officials are accepting public comments this month, and the changes will be heard by the Water Quality Control Board in October.\Officials at the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation say the changes are meant to improve the permitting process while protecting waterways.\But environmental groups are concerned that proposed changes will further erode Tennessee's water pollution protections. For decades, Tennessee had stricter standards than federal requirements.\Environmentalists point to a recent shopping center project in Cookeville, where TDEC allowed a developer to fill in protected wetlands. With the proposed rule changes, advocates say, road builders and developers would have fewer obstacles to this type of environmental degradation.\Tennessee — led by the Republican-dominated General Assembly — has been chipping away at water quality regulations in recent years. It eased storm water runoff standards on new construction in 2016 and loosened permitting rules for large industrial farms this year. In both cases, the Haslam administration opposed the changes, but the governor allowed them to become law without a veto.\However, the current rule changes are being driven by the administration, rather than the legislature. Some were prompted by a triennial review of water quality rules mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. While the modifications aren't as dramatic as recent deregulation at the EPA, advocates say they could cause some collateral damage.\""Essentially they are rolling back the standard for giving permits, which are meant to protect water bodies,"" said Brian Paddock, legal adviser to the Tennessee chapter of the Sierra Club.\One rule change would make it clear that developers could disturb some of the state's most bio-diverse and pristine streams and wetlands — those considered ""exceptional Tennessee waters"" — as long as they mitigate the damage within a defined nearby area. Under today's rules, developers looking to impact these protected water bodies generally have to first show there are no alternatives, and that there's an economic or social necessity for the development.\The Department of Environment and Conservation recently used a provision in the law to allow paving over protected wetlands without that full analysis, environmentalists say. They fear the rule changes would make this the standard.\TDEC regulators in 2016 greenlighted the Shoppes at Eagle Pointe in Cookeville, a more than 200,000-square-foot shopping center with a Publix and an Academy Sports. Developers Browning Development Solutions of Brentwood proposed filling in more than 3 acres of wetlands, most of which TDEC deemed exceptional. The center is still under construction.\""This was the first time it's ever been applied to the complete destruction of a wetland,"" Paddock said.\Regulators stopped short of the formal decision process meant to evaluate alternatives and economic or social need because Browning agreed to buy and preserve more than 40 acres of wetlands.\Those wetlands, four miles south of Cookeville, contained plant species considered endangered or threatened.\The Sierra Club appealed in 2016 and then sued, claiming the permit was granted improperly. TDEC officials maintain they followed the law. Two judges have sided with the state, and the Water Quality Control Board is set to hear the environmental group's appeal in October.\""While the Sierra Club has chosen to litigate an ongoing case in the media,"" TDEC spokesman Eric Ward said, ""we will not comment on the ongoing litigation out of respect for the judicial process — a process that has ruled in TDEC's favor twice already.""\The rule changes would require mitigation be done within an arearoughly the size of a county. Today, the rules don't stipulate the boundaries, but TDEC has an unwritten policy of using a smaller geographic area. Experts caution the proposed allowable regions may be too large.\""Mitigation that's removed from the impacted aquatic system just doesn't protect or preserve the impacted waters,"" said Paul Davis, a former TDEC water quality official.\While a rural area might be preserved or rehabilitated, environmentalists say the process will jeopardize streams and wetlands in the path of urbanization.\""It means for urban areas the few remaining functioning streams and the few remaining wetlands are going to be sold off for development,"" said Paddock.\TDEC officials say this change is meant to bring clarity and consistency to the permitting process. Today, the state and the Army Corps of Engineers sometimes have different geographic requirements for mitigation. As a result, some developers have had to mitigate their impacts in more than one location, TDEC officials said.\When Lowe's applied to build a distribution center in Coopertown on 1.2 acres of wetlands, it had to both preserve 19 acres of nearby wetlands and pay $24,000 into a wetlands mitigation fund.\""What we're really trying to do is provide a more fair, transparent and predictable permit process,"" said TDEC Deputy Commissioner Tisha Calabrese Benton.\The conflicting state and federal standards can mean longer construction schedules and bigger budgets for TDOT road projects.\Last year, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a gas tax increase as part of Gov. Bill Haslam's IMPROVE ACT, a plan to fund a backlog of needed transportation projects.\""With the passage of the Improve Act, TDOT is trying to deliver more projects than ever before, and these restrictions make it difficult to deliver them in a timely manner,"" said TDOT spokeswoman Beth Emmons. ""We began working with TDEC in an effort to make the state rules more in line with the federal ones.""\In the 2000s, TDOT faced criticism for failing to mitigate wetlands it destroyed during road construction, and for clogging creeks with sediment when building State Route 840. It was fined $800,000 — the largest penalty up to that point — for violating the Tennessee Water Quality Control Act of 1972.\Another set of rule changes that could impact water quality, advocates say, would clarify the level of acceptable pollution or damage in a stream. The rule changes propose setting ""baseline conditions"" when a developer applies for a permit. Any impacts to the stream or wetlands would be judged based on the conditions present at the time the project is proposed, as opposed to more pristine levels.\""Baselines are pivotal because they govern regulation in the future,"" said Dean Rivkin, a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law. ""If the baseline is wrong, future pollution limits may be too weak — under-regulation — or, in some cases, too strict —over-regulation.""\Jim Redwine, vice president of the Harpeth Conservancy, is concerned that the proposed rules would formally allow TDEC to sign off on permits that would allow levels of nutrients higher than federal guidelines. Excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous can cause algeal blooms that choke off the oxygen supply for wildlife.\When evaluating how much nutrients to allow in a stream, regulators compare ""reference"" conditions in other waterways. The EPA recommends that states set the allowable limits of nutrients to a certain level in the reference streams, but TDEC has been using a more lenient standard, potentially allowing more nutrients. These rules will essentially codify the standard.\""We're concerned about specifically selecting these streams that are already polluted, and setting the bar too high,"" said Redwine. ""It's another way to 'grandfather in' pollution, and not address what's in Tennessee's waterways.""\TDEC officials said they tested both levels across the state and found that their standard set realistic expectations, and that the EPA approved the approach.\Reach Mike Reicher at 615-259-8228 and on Twitter @mreicher.\How to participate\Members of the public can submit comments on the proposed rules until July 31.\Details about the changes are posted on the TDEC website at tn.gov/environment. Look for ""Water Notices & Hearings"" on the Division of Water Resources page.\Comments can be emailed to TDEC at the addresses listed on the website.\Brian Paddock of the Sierra Club poses for a portrait outside a construction site that borders wetlands in Cookeville, Tenn.

121,"To the Editor:\I read in the article, ""Bredesen: Gas tax may rise,"" Jan. 13, that the governor and some in the legislature are considering a tax increase on cigarettes. Tennessee's tax on cigarettes is still one of the lowest compared with other states; less than one fourth the national average. But Tennessee's tax on grocery food -- 6 percent -- is one of the highest in the country.\***\In fact, Tennessee is one of the few states that still levies a sales tax on grocery food. One possibility is to use the new tax revenue from a higher tax on cigarettes to lower the state sales tax of 6 percent on grocery food.\Because food is an absolute necessity for everyone, it is morally wrong to derive state revenue from taxing grocery food. Still, the state goes on charging 6 percent sales tax on baby food, but it doesn't charge any sales tax on oats for racehorses.\What kind of sense does that make? Isn't it time to bring some sensibility to our Tennessee state tax system?\Phil Schoggen\Nashville 37205\Will extra tax help\finish Briley Parkway?\To the Editor:\I understand Gov. Phil Bredesen wants to raise the tax on gasoline to fund better roads in Tennessee. Does that mean Briley Parkway will be finished this decade?\Martin Barber\Nashville 37211\martin5023@bellsouth.net\Innocent people\are killed every day\To the Editor:\There are two things wrong with letters that oppose the death penalty but support life without parole, the latest being Bob Fajardo's which appeared on Jan. 16, ""Life in prison, yes; death penalty, no.""\First, there is no such thing as life without parole for this reason: Such a law can be repealed at any time nullifying the sentence and requiring some kind of re-sentencing.\Second, if a prisoner serving life without parole kills a prison guard, no additional punishment can be imposed -- thus, we accommodate murder with impunity. Clearly outrageous.\When opponents of the death penalty are asked what further punishment is warranted, they shrug their shoulders in silence.\I support the death penalty as a matter of justice. Punishment should fit the crime by exacting upon the convict a penalty that closely approximates the damage he caused. Criminals such as Saddam Hussein or Timothy McVeigh can never know the grief, the pain, the anguish they caused survivors. Genuine justice can only come when they pay with their lives.\For those who worry about killing an innocent person, please know that we lose the lives of innocent people regularly. Ask test pilots, policemen, firemen and soldiers, all of whose lives are far, far more valuable than those of murderers.\Gene A. Russell\Nashville 37201\grusselltn@aol.com\Obama can't be\a serious contender\To the Editor:\Barack Obama joins the growing list of Democratic presidential candidates who have never owned a business, never met a payroll and never balanced a budget. The man has virtually no work history and almost no experience in government.\The idea that Obama would even be considered a serious candidate illustrates how ""silly"" the presidential process has become.\There was a time in this country when a serious presidential candidate had to have military experience, business experience and, preferably, experience as governor of a state. Bill Clinton evidently proved that Americans no longer care if their president has any military and business experience. But Clinton was the governor of a small state. That's something the leading Democrat candidates (Obama, John Edwards and Hillary Clinton) can't claim.\I was in New Mexico this past fall, and I saw some of Gov. Bill Richardson's television commercials. Richardson was successfully running for re-election. There was nothing in Richardson's message that would label him a Democrat and a Hispanic.\Richardson -- a serious man -- is above labels. In this season of silliness, it doesn't figure that Richardson, an ""unannounced"" presidential candidate, has a chance.\Richard H. Knight Jr.\Nashville 37205\A reasonable plan\for success in Iraq\To the Editor:\President Bush's ""new plan"" for Iraq assures us of more deaths, more deterioration of U.S. support world-wide, more anti-U.S. terrorists and more money wasted and an outcome that is going to be much worse than the Iraqi situation today.\Would not a more reasonable approach be:\1. President Bush admits to the world that for whatever reason he really started the war, he was wrong in starting it.\2. Congress should also admit they failed to live up to their responsibilities in letting the president start the war.\With that clean slate:\3. We should recognize/accept that the conflict in Iraq is a Middle East political problem, not simply a military problem in Iraq.\4. We should ask all of the nations of the Middle East to participate in an effort to stabilize the situation in Iraq. We should offer support for that effort but not have a direct input unless asked.\5. We should be ready to accept a Middle Eastern plan for a peaceful Iraq, a nation that was held together by one of the worst police states in history.\6. We should withdraw when the Middle East has a plan and calls for our withdrawal.\This plan will at least provide the basis for rebuilding our credibility/support throughout the world.\If any lesson should have been learned in Vietnam, it is that an unpopular ineffective government cannot be kept in place by a foreign military force; no matter how large or rich it is, or how long it tries.\Hold your government responsible for its actions.\William Sonricker\Nashville 37221\Sonricker2@att.net\Observe rules\for flying U.S. flag\To the Editor:\Any person who flies the U.S. flag should know that the flag represents the many freedoms and rights of being a U.S. citizen not given to citizens of any other country in the world.\This also brings responsibilities. If you fly the U.S. flag, you should be cognizant of the rules by which the flag is flown.\I have seen many, many examples of incorrect flag usage in this area. As a veteran and past commander of the American Legion, this is of importance to me.\At the present time, many flags have been raised to the top of the staff, which is incorrect; flags should be at half-staff for the passing of a past president of the United States. The flag should be flown at half-staff 30 days from the date of death of a former president.\I am always proud to see an American flag flying; however, with so many of our men and women of the armed forces whose lives are in danger, we should at the very least fly the flag in respect and honor and in the proper way.\D. Warren Harrison\Hendersonville 37075\Guidelines would\help modernize city\To the Editor:\When I moved from Los Angeles to Nashville four years ago, I made the assumption that neither the city nor its inhabitants had concern for the environment.\For one thing, I was surprised to find that Nashvillians have to take care of recycling much of their refuse themselves. I was used to the multiple, multi-colored trash bins provided by the city of Los Angeles, into which residents sort their recyclables and leave them for pickup.\But I've since realized that I was wrong. People in Nashville do care about living ethically, if the swarms of people lugging boxes of containers and bottles to our local recycling facilities on any given day are any indication. And Nashville's infrastructure needs to reflect the concerns of its citizens.\One prominent way to do this would be to approve the initiative that would require new Metro buildings to meet LEED environmental guidelines. Many other major cities have approved similar legislation, and have taken steps to make sure their facilities are as efficient, modern and safe as they can be.\Don't we want this for Nashville? Don't we want to be known as a world-class city with a conscience?\Nicole Seymour\Nashville 37212\iluvgossip@hotmail.com\Time for some\'60s war protests?\To the Editor:\Once again President Bush has decided not to listen. He didn't listen when everyone from President Gerald Ford to Congress, and even his father told him not to declare war on Iraq.\He lied to the American people, and now we are neck-deep in a mess that only a miracle could solve. Twenty thousand more young troops are being sent to Iraq, and for what? To fight for a country that won't even fight for itself. Bush wants you to forget that Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11.\Where are they going to get more troops? The Selective Srvice system is planning to test the military draft machinery in 2009. Why do you think this is happening? Are our children going to be called to serve?\When Bush ran for office, he said he was not a nation builder. Well he was right about that. He sure can't build a nation, but he knows how to bring one down. We are spending millions a day on this war -- over $500 billion so far, and still he wants more. Over 3,000 dead and 20,000 crippled for life is to much to pay for his vanity. Seventy one percent of the American people want our soldiers home.\Maybe it's time we took to the streets again like in the '60s and protest.\Patsy Hicks\Livingston 38570\dan1946@twlakes.net\Condemning other faiths\isn't religious freedom\To the Editor:\This is in regard to the letter from Carolyn Dobbins, ""Day set aside to practice freedom,"" Jan. 14. In her letter, she states that students should be allowed to mention their personal religious faith in homework or classroom discussions.\Now, I have great regard for Mrs. Dobbins, as one of our family members was her student at one time and she is a most excellent teacher, but I can only agree with her to a certain extent on the religious expression matter in public school.\Yes, we should and do have religious freedom in America and should not be afraid to mention our faith if we wish to do so. However, since it seems that major religions profess to be the only ""true"" one and everyone else is going to hell, shouldn't there be restrictions on condemning other faiths? Also, I do not believe it should be allowed for people to actively attempt to make converts in school. Serious problems are possible here.\It is wonderful to promote understanding and friendship among different religious groups; not so good to create animosity and dislike.

Fidel Castro is in ""grave"" condition. He's suffering from diverticulitis, and he has to have surgery to repair this condition, not once, not twice, but three times, all from doctors flown in from Spain. But, since this diverticulitis is not really life-threatening, one has to wonder why Fidel's condition is ""grave.""\It boils down to the absolute best health care in the world, or so the left claims that Cuba has. They tout the benefits of a free system down there; they proclaim how good it is, and so on, ad nauseum, and the left is currently trying to shove the same thing down our throats.\And the additional fact to ponder is that good old Fidel avoided Cuban doctors during his current stay, opting instead for imported Spanish ones who put him on the ""grave condition"" list via a demonstration of the quality of their own health-care system.\Go figure.\Brian Macdonald\Murfreesboro 37130\bmac_42@excite.com\Citizens already\pay enough taxes\To the Editor:\As far as I am concerned, any elected official that supports/votes for this tax hike will be looking for a job next term, maybe sooner.

I think business owners would welcome a law against smoking. It gets them off the hook and the patrons can blame the government.\Linda Huskey\Antioch 37013\Non-smokers need\breathing room\To the Editor:\I agree with David Leonard's letter Jan. 17, ""Patrons have right to smoke in bars.""\I am not a smoker and never have been. My father died with emphysema, a debilitating death that took away the better quality of life he might have had. His heart was so enlarged from labored breathing, that he suffered a massive heart attack and died years before he should have.\Even knowing that people die with lung cancer and emphysema, there are still those who are going to smoke to satisfy a powerful habit that is obviously very hard to break. Since I am not a smoker, I cannot begin to identify with how hard breaking this habit would be.\The reason I feel that buildings should have designated smoking areas is that I think it is better than having smokers right by the door or just outside the buildings where others have to enter or pass by. And that is the way it is.\Non-smoking areas won't get every smoker off the street or out of our faces as we enter buildings; however, I want every breath of air I can get that doesn't contain second-hand smoke.\Laurel Johnson\Franklin 37064\It isn't a 'choice;'\it is an addiction\To the Editor:\I've noticed the ongoing debate regarding smoking in public areas, invariably the defense for smoking gravitates around ""right to choose."" Well I've a question.\If it is indeed a choice, when was the last time a smoker chose to not smoke for a day? It doesn't happen, most likely due to chemical dependence.

122,"State Sen. Jim Tracy in District 14 against Gayle Jordan.\What is your position on Tennessee's gas tax when many contend this revenue is not keeping up with the cost for road projects?\Jordan: When considering the gas tax in a vacuum, one would logically deduce that since the state currently has a budget surplus, there is no need to increase any tax. However, when you take into account that schools are underfunded by $500 million, and the American Society of Civil Engineers indicate that our infrastructure is a C minus and is also underfunded, we have to acknowledge that the sequence is to first fully fund our schools and transportation projects, and then assess whether the current tax is adequate to respond to road use and growth. Our state budget is a phantom budget and gives us no accurate indication of the needs of Tennessee.\Tracy: With state budget surpluses at an all-time high, including an over-collection of almost $50 million on gas taxes alone last fiscal year, now is not the time to be putting an even higher tax burden on our citizens. Tennessee has always been a pay-as-you-go state on road projects. We need to eliminate wasteful spending in other areas of government and re-prioritize the dollars we already have before we ever consider raising taxes one cent. I will continue to work with county and city governments to prioritize road projects.\What is your position on Gov. Bill Haslam's Insure Tennessee proposal that accepts expanded Medicaid funding available from the Affordable Care Act to provide more health care coverage for low-income residents?\Jordan: There is absolutely no logical reason why we have not accepted this expansion. We have experienced significant negative impact on our state from the closing of eight hospitals, with dozens more at risk of closing from treating the uninsured with no reimbursement, and the associated loss of jobs. The Tennessee hospital Association has agreed to make up for any shortfall, meaning that this expansion comes at a cost of zero dollars and zero cents to the state budget. Gov. Haslam introduced this plan, and it is supported by a majority of Tennesseans. We should all be outraged that our fellow Tennesseans, working people and many veterans, are suffering and dying of treatable conditions, for no reason that the Republicans have been able to articulate.\Tracy: We cannot afford to bring Obamacare to Tennessee. State after state has experienced the Obamacare disaster. Minnesota is the most vivid example. Even Bill Clinton said Obamacare is the craziest thing in the world. I have been working with members from across the state to find conservative, free-market solutions to address access to healthcare challenges in our rural communities. We need to find real solutions, not look for ways to re-brand the Obamacare disaster.\What is your position on the governor's proposal to provide low-income families with vouchers to help pay for private school tuition for their children?\Jordan: As with the gas tax, it is impossible to get an accurate picture of the need for vouchers without having a fully funded education line item. Accommodating vouchers and charter schools compounds this problem because they create a negative impact on local school budgets. Additionally, I am a fervent defender of public money being used only in public schools.\Tracy: I support any method to increase access to quality education in Tennessee. Charter schools and opportunity scholarships help get children out of failing schools and into educational environments that they can thrive and grow in, especially in inner-city Memphis. We need to make sure that each child has access to the quality of education.\What is your position on unfunded mandates from the state government, such as one that contributed to a property tax increase in Rutherford County to buy computers required for students to take standardized tests?\Jordan: If the state demands a mandate, the funding should come from the state, particularly in a time of surplus. Local governments should have the ability to address the needs in their community with autonomy. Local governments now have to deal with the loss of income from the Hall Income Tax, a tax levied on investment income affecting 5 percent of Tennesseans, which will increase property tax, reduce services, or both.\Tracy: As a conservative, I'm against unfunded mandates -- period. Strong fiscal conservatism is the hallmark of any well run government. In 2013, the General Assembly provided $50 million in technology funding to help LEAs (local education agencies, also known as school districts). This year we increased technology funding statewide by $15 million. As we all know, computers are a common presence in classrooms all over the state -- not only for testing but as a necessary teaching tool in the 21st Century. Before any tax increase is ever considered, state and local governments both need to work together, eliminate waste, and make sure each dollar taken from taxpayers is put to its highest and best use.\What do you see as the most important issue and what is your position on this?\Jordan: I believe that our most important issue is the fiscal irresponsibility our legislature has shown. We have a useless state budget. Having a surplus has no meaning if our schools are underfunded, and we are not investing in infrastructure improvement. We are unable to make any meaningful assessments of where the needs are until this occurs. In addition to failing to give us an accurate snapshot of our current needs, our legislature has left $2.5 billion unclaimed, and our hospitals at risk because we haven't expanded Medicaid. Most recently, our legislature had to reconvene, at a taxpayer cost of $25,000 per day, because in an effort to compress the session, it cut staff and resources, and made a potential $60 million mistake. Fiscal irresponsibility is an insult to taxpayers, and those responsible should be held accountable.\Tracy: The most important issue facing Tennessee is education. I led the fight to shake up the status quo, repeal Common Core and to make teacher evaluations more efficient and fairer. This past year we budgeted an unprecedented $100 million for teacher pay raises -- without raising taxes. Education is the great equalizer. To fully access the American dream and succeed in the modern economy, a world class education is crucial. A great education means a great quality job. We committed to putting a great Tennessee teacher in every Tennessee classroom. Now Tennessee is the most improved state in the nation in education."

124,"As the Tennessee Department of Transportation looks to spend new revenue from the gas tax increaseapproved by the legislature in 2017, it's hit a speed bump: the state's water quality regulations.\State environmental regulators are hoping to change the rules so that TDOT — which has a history of water quality violations — and real estate developers will have less trouble obtaining permits when they want to divert a stream, pave over wetlands or otherwise alter the state's waterways.\The proposed rule changes would stipulate where developers can mitigate damage done to streams, and would establish a baseline for pollution or alterations from which any harm would have to be offset. Officials are accepting public comments this month, and the changes will be heard by the Water Quality Control Board in October.\Officials at the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation say the changes are meant to improve the permitting process while protecting waterways.\But environmental groups are concerned that proposed changes will further erode Tennessee's water pollution protections. For decades, Tennessee had stricter standards than federal requirements.\Environmentalists point to a recent shopping center project in Cookeville, where TDEC allowed a developer to fill in protected wetlands. With the proposed rule changes, advocates say, road builders and developers would have fewer obstacles to this type of environmental degradation.\Tennessee — led by the Republican-dominated General Assembly — has been chipping away at water quality regulations in recent years. It eased storm water runoff standards on new construction in 2016 and loosened permitting rules for large industrial farms this year. In both cases, the Haslam administration opposed the changes, but the governor allowed them to become law without a veto.\However, the current rule changes are being driven by the administration, rather than the legislature. Some were prompted by a triennial review of water quality rules mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. While the modifications aren't as dramatic as recent deregulation at the EPA, advocates say they could cause some collateral damage.\""Essentially they are rolling back the standard for giving permits, which are meant to protect water bodies,"" said Brian Paddock, legal adviser to the Tennessee chapter of the Sierra Club.\One rule change would make it clear that developers could disturb some of the state's most bio-diverse and pristine streams and wetlands — those considered ""exceptional Tennessee waters"" — as long as they mitigate the damage within a defined nearby area. Under today's rules, developers looking to impact these protected water bodies generally have to first show there are no alternatives, and that there's an economic or social necessity for the development.\The Department of Environment and Conservation recently used a provision in the law to allow paving over protected wetlands without that full analysis, environmentalists say. They fear the rule changes would make this the standard.\TDEC regulators in 2016 greenlighted the Shoppes at Eagle Pointe in Cookeville, a more than 200,000-square-foot shopping center with a Publix and an Academy Sports. Developers Browning Development Solutions of Brentwood proposed filling in more than 3 acres of wetlands, most of which TDEC deemed exceptional. The center is still under construction.\""This was the first time it's ever been applied to the complete destruction of a wetland,"" Paddock said.\Regulators stopped short of the formal decision process meant to evaluate alternatives and economic or social need because Browning agreed to buy and preserve more than 40 acres of wetlands. Those wetlands, four miles south of Cookeville, contained plant species considered endangered or threatened.\The Sierra Club appealed in 2016 and then sued, claiming the permit was granted improperly. TDEC officials maintain they followed the law. Two judges have sided with the state, and the Water Quality Control Board is set to hear the environmental group's appeal in October.\""While the Sierra Club has chosen to litigate an ongoing case in the media,"" TDEC spokesman Eric Ward said, ""we will not comment on the ongoing litigation out of respect for the judicial process — a process that has ruled in TDEC's favor twice already.""\The rule changes would require mitigation be done within an arearoughly the size of a county. Today, the rules don't stipulate the boundaries, but TDEC has an unwritten policy of using a smaller geographic area.

125,"As the Tennessee Department of Transportation looks to spend new revenue from the gas tax increaseapproved by the legislature in 2017, it's hit a speed bump: the state's water quality regulations.\State environmental regulators are hoping to change the rules so that TDOT — which has a history of water quality violations — and real estate developers will have less trouble obtaining permits when they want to divert a stream, pave over wetlands or otherwise alter the state's waterways.\The proposed rule changes would stipulate where developers can mitigate damage done to streams, and would establish a baseline for pollution or alterations from which any harm would have to be offset. Officials are accepting public comments this month, and the changes will be heard by the Water Quality Control Board in October.\Officials at the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation say the changes are meant to improve the permitting process while protecting waterways.\But environmental groups are concerned that proposed changes will further erode Tennessee's water pollution protections. For decades, Tennessee had stricter standards than federal requirements.\Environmentalists point to a recent shopping center project in Cookeville, where TDEC allowed a developer to fill in protected wetlands. With the proposed rule changes, advocates say, road builders and developers would have fewer obstacles to this type of environmental degradation.\Tennessee — led by the Republican-dominated General Assembly — has been chipping away at water quality regulations in recent years. It eased storm water runoff standards on new construction in 2016 and loosened permitting rules for large industrial farms this year. In both cases, the Haslam administration opposed the changes, but the governor allowed them to become law without a veto.\However, the current rule changes are being driven by the administration, rather than the legislature. Some were prompted by a triennial review of water quality rules mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. While the modifications aren't as dramatic as recent deregulation at the EPA, advocates say they could cause some collateral damage.\""Essentially they are rolling back the standard for giving permits, which are meant to protect water bodies,"" said Brian Paddock, legal adviser to the Tennessee chapter of the Sierra Club.\One rule change would make it clear that developers could disturb some of the state's most bio-diverse and pristine streams and wetlands — those considered ""exceptional Tennessee waters"" — as long as they mitigate the damage within a defined nearby area. Under today's rules, developers looking to impact these protected water bodies generally have to first show there are no alternatives, and that there's an economic or social necessity for the development.\The Department of Environment and Conservation recently used a provision in the law to allow paving over protected wetlands without that full analysis, environmentalists say. They fear the rule changes would make this the standard.\TDEC regulators in 2016 greenlighted the Shoppes at Eagle Pointe in Cookeville, a more than 200,000-square-foot shopping center with a Publix and an Academy Sports. Developers Browning Development Solutions of Brentwood proposed filling in more than 3 acres of wetlands, most of which TDEC deemed exceptional. The center is still under construction.\""This was the first time it's ever been applied to the complete destruction of a wetland,"" Paddock said.\Regulators stopped short of the formal decision process meant to evaluate alternatives and economic or social need because Browning agreed to buy and preserve more than 40 acres of wetlands. Those wetlands, four miles south of Cookeville, contained plant species considered endangered or threatened.\The Sierra Club appealed in 2016 and then sued, claiming the permit was granted improperly. TDEC officials maintain they followed the law. Two judges have sided with the state, and the Water Quality Control Board is set to hear the environmental group's appeal in October.\""While the Sierra Club has chosen to litigate an ongoing case in the media,"" TDEC spokesman Eric Ward said, ""we will not comment on the ongoing litigation out of respect for the judicial process — a process that has ruled in TDEC's favor twice already.""\The rule changes would require mitigation be done within an arearoughly the size of a county. Today, the rules don't stipulate the boundaries, but TDEC has an unwritten policy of using a smaller geographic area. Experts caution the proposed allowable regions may be too large.\""Mitigation that's removed from the impacted aquatic system just doesn't protect or preserve the impacted waters,"" said Paul Davis, a former TDEC water quality official.\While a rural area might be preserved or rehabilitated, environmentalists say the process will jeopardize streams and wetlands in the path of urbanization.\""It means for urban areas the few remaining functioning streams and the few remaining wetlands are going to be sold off for development,"" said Paddock.\TDEC officials say this change is meant to bring clarity and consistency to the permitting process.

Hamilton County could get a fifth vehicle bridge across the Tennessee River within the next decade, but its users would need to pay $5 per trip to cover the costs of the span and related roads, a new study shows.
\
Consultants for the Tennessee Department of Transportation told local elected officials Wednesday that a new bridge in northern Hamilton County is feasible and could offer a quicker and more direct route between Collegedale and Soddy-Daisy -- the fastest-growing municipalities in the region.
\
But state transportation leaders said they are wary about the proposed fees needed to support what could be Tennessee's first toll bridge.
\
""I don't know that the people of Tennessee are willing to pay $5 to go across a bridge each way,"" said Joe Carpenter, TDOT's chief of environment and planning, who suggested more studies.
\
""This project is feasible, but it's not a slam dunk,"" Carpenter said.
\
Supporters of the new bridge insist a $5 toll may not seem that high by the time such a road is erected in 2018 or later. And the bridge would save time and fuel if drivers can shorten the current 50-mile trip from Ooltewah or Collegedale to Lakesite or Soddy-Daisy.
\
State Rep. Jim Cobb, R-Spring City, who convened Wednesday's bridge update, said growth from more than $2.5 billion of new plants being built by Volkswagen, Wacker Chemical and Amazon in Hamilton and Bradley counties mean a toll bridge would be well used.
\
""I think these developments took this project from 'probably not' to 'maybe will,'"" Cobb said. ""The $5 toll seems too high right now, but in eight to 10 years when this bridge could be built and opened that may not seem that bad.""
\
TOLLING FOR DOLLARS
\
Tennessee doesn't charge fees for motorists to use roads or bridges. But growing maintenance needs and slowing gas tax collections have state officials looking at new ways to pay for needed infrastructure.
\
Carpenter said the state has more than $9 billion of unfunded projects under way, and maintenance of existing roads and bridges is likely to absorb a bigger share of TDOT's budgets in the future.
\
In 2007, the Tennessee General Assembly authorized state transportation planners to consider eight toll roads and bridges to keep the state from spending its own money.
\
The most feasible proposal is the bridge in northern Hamilton County -- $152 million to $246 million for the bridge and related roads -- and a bridge across the Mississippi River that could cost up to $1 billion.
\
Rebecca Brooks, director of development services for the consulting firm of Wilbur Smith and Associates, said the firm's study indicates that 6,700 to 7,600 cars and trucks would cross the northern Hamilton toll bridge every day, even with a $5 toll.
\
""That is a relatively low volume, but it is feasible,"" she said.
\
Lower-volume toll bridges are working in Orange Beach, Ala., and in Millbrook, Ala., she said.
\
Local planners have been pushing for a Tennessee River bridge between the Chickamauga Dam in Hixson and Highway 60 more than 30 miles upriver.
\
""This was put on the drawing board back in the 1970s and it's time to quit talking about this bridge and now do something about it,"" said Hamilton County Trustee and former County Commissioner Bill Hullander.
\
FINDING A ROUTE
\
TDOT consultants developed four alternatives for the toll bridge.
\
They include either a new interchange at mile marker 13 on Interstate 75, or the extension of the Enterprise South road through the industrial park to connect with Highway 58. The proposed bridge would be built near Lakesite across Lake Chickamauga.
\
TDOT already has spent $457,000 on studies. Next come more than $1 million for mapping, environmental studies and a detailed grading report, plus engineering and design costs, Carpenter said.
\
""We have to recognize that's a lot of money and will likely have to come out of other projects,"" he said.
\
State Rep. Bill Harmon, D-Dunlap, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said TDOT ""spends a tremendous amount of money on studies that don't accomplish anything.""
\
Harmon said he is wary of additional study since Gov.-elect Bill Haslam said during the campaign that he doesn't favor toll roads.
\
""Revenues are going down and costs are going up, but I'm just not sure that Tennessee is ready yet for toll roads,"" Harmon said.
\
But Chattanooga Mayor Ron Littlefield said planners need to prepare for the expected influx coming from Volkswagen and other businesses.
\
""There are no easy answers to where the money is coming from, but we need to plan for the growth that is coming to our region and I think this bridge, should be part of that effort,"" he said.

127,"GOP wants only 'little people to pay taxes'\To the Editor:\Many years ago, during her trial for tax evasion, Leona Helmsley, the ""Queen of Mean,"" summed up a core belief apparently held by a segment of the wealthiest Americans about our tax system: ""Only the little people pay taxes.""\***\The story about a dubious tax shelter being exploited by a Bush administration Cabinet secretary is a reminder a generation later that that core value is alive and well through manipulation of our tax system. (""Cabinet secretary defends family charitable giving,"" July 22)\And what a devilishly elegant scheme it is: A cooperative Republican-controlled Congress enacts tax laws with built-in loopholes, allowing the best tax attorneys that money can buy (who, incidentally, might have had a hand in writing the laws) to argue that their clients are just taking advantage of existing tax law.\Combined with Republican tax cuts so heavily favoring the wealthiest Americans, these tax-dodge scams place an increasing tax burden on hard-working, middle class families. At the same time, their budget cuts disproportionately affect those most in need, most vulnerable and those most powerless to do anything about it.\Will Leona Helmsley prove to be right? Perhaps, but only if those in power succeed in distracting the electorate by proclaiming the greatest threats to our well-being are flag burning or that gay couple living harmoniously down the street -- while they put the economic squeeze on the ""little people"" who elect them.\Byron Hillblom\Antioch 37013\Metro Water picks on small group of people\To the Editor:\While it is absolutely unfair for Metro to start charging people for a service they aren't using, it is politically easier to pick the pocket of a small group of people than to raise the rates for everyone.\I have an idea for these politicians -- let's just send a bill to the citizens of Knoxville or Birmingham. They aren't using the sewers any more than those folks you are going to stiff in Davidson County, and they can't vote against you.\Everyone wins.\Bruce Tarkington\Nashville 37221\svalbard10@aol.com\Militant regimes must be destroyed\To the Editor:\We often hear the cry that Americans are falling behind other nations in math and science. I contend our shortcomings are equally evident in history and logic.\Local and syndicated writers and news analysts have shown their ignorance in these areas, stating Israel shares the blame for the crisis in Lebanon, demanding that they should use restraint or be restrained from using excessive retaliatory force against the extreme, hate-driven Hezbollah zealots.\Some have concluded that since the Israeli military has inflicted multi-fold more casualties, the fighting must be unfair. Likely not printable, I think I know how my war hero, Gen. George S. Patton, would respond to that gibberish.\Hezbollah, aided by Iran and Syria, is to blame for the strife in Israel and southern Lebanon. Some expound that the spineless, resolution-happy United Nations should call for an immediate cease-fire and initiate peace talks. As expected, Kofi Annan, defying logic and denying history to pierce his brain, has already filled the air waves with equally meaningless rhetoric.\Some call it WWIII; others say it is a religious war. I think the WWII chant, ""Praise the Lord, and pass the ammunition"" appears to be the only route to lasting peace as was true in destroying the regimes of Hitler and Tojo.\Some may disagree, but, in addition to logic, I have unabridged history, past and present, to support my argument.\Milt Herring\Old Hickory 37138\mshalh@aol.com\Gang problem can be cured by a draft\To the Editor:\I think the gang problem would be solved with the military draft.

(""No new taxes to fund new rail system,"" July 23)\Perhaps he would like some facts before espousing his views. According to the TDOT budget for 2006, we Tennesseans are spending just over 2.5 percent for air, water and rail transport. Admittedly, this does not include ""mass transit"" costs, mainly buses, which would increase the total budget for all mass transit to 7.25 percent.\Meanwhile, state highway construction is costing us nearly $1 billion, and the gas tax only pays for about 70 percent of it.\I am tired of paying taxes, interest rates and health insurance premiums that are so much higher than necessary because we are importing foreign oil so we can ride in SUVs.\If we really care about this country, we need to make some major changes to reduce our international trade deficits (mainly due to oil), quit being beholden to Middle East and other oil country despots and stop polluting the wonderful Earth God gave us.\We can start here in Nashville. Getting rail transport is a part of it. So is getting a bike-friendly and walking friendly environment. Americans, start now.\Bob Freisinger\Franklin 37069\wisten@yahoo.com\Sparing elephant's life was right thing to do\To the Editor:\Winkie gets a stay of execution.

Why would this elephant be killed so quickly when it takes 20 plus years to put a human killer to death for the same thing? (""Tearful handler; 'In 45 seconds, it was over' "" July 25)\Winkie was probably tortured as she grew up. Chained down and beat on repeatedly. Would that be the angle a lawyer would use to get a death row inmate off, his or her mental state being tortured as a child? If one person made the decision to execute Winkie, does she get a chance to plead her case?\The quick judgment to not execute Winkie was a good choice. Her handler, Joanna Burke, who was killed, had said to not euthanize any elephant for causing harm or death to her, and she meant it. She most likely knew the treatment these elephants endured growing up in captivity. Her passion for these creatures meant more to her than life, and she proved it.\Hopefully, Winkie will not cause harm to any other handler in the rest of her years at her sanctuary, and since they have such a superb memory, maybe Winkie will think often of Joanna's kindness and wish she had not caused her death.\No one but Winkie will ever know.\Gower Mills\Nashville 37209\MrGowerM64@aol.com\Stem cell 'cures' are not guaranteed\To the Editor:\Bravo, indeed.

The ""end"" in question is not even a guaranteed end; it's a long shot, at best.

He has no say in what another American says at that show or anywhere else in the world.\The biggest complaint Mr. Fulton and his ilk have isn't against the Dixie Chicks; it's against the administration that they protested -- the one that has failed at everything it's done except to divide the nation more than it has ever been since the middle of the 19th century.\Mr. Fulton cannot justify the actions of this hapless group of so-called patriots who have stepped all over the documents that created this nation to further political aspirations -- because they cannot be justified -- so he turns his vitriol to those who have seen the truth since the beginning.\The sad truth is, Natalie Maines was right, period. The president has shamed the nation again and again, and he continues to do it. He's directly responsible for the deaths of over 2,500 Americans, military and civilian in a war that he started based on the lies of his Cabinet, and now the world is suffering the consequences of his actions.\I'm ashamed to call him an American, too.

128,"The debate over the future of transit in Nashville reflects the difficult choices Music City faces in growing its rising prosperity and reducing its equally increasing inequality.\There is no question that Nashville must find alternative, reliable ways to move residents and visitors around the Middle Tennessee region and ensure them access to jobs, housing options, services, entertainment and recreation.\Congestion is increasingly growing, commute times are getting longer, and roadways are at or beyond capacity. The region's 1.8-million population is growing by 100 people a day, with projections of 1 million more living here within the next 20 years, according to Nashville Metropolitan Planning Organization projections.\At the same time visitors are flocking to the area and growing tourism is fueling the local economy, adding opportunities for international flights and attracting businesses but also straining the local infrastructure.\""If we don't do something, we really risk the quality of life in the future,"" said Steve Bland, CEO of the Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) and the Regional Transportation Authority of Middle Tennessee (RTA).\""It's not like things have gotten better,"" he added. ""There's no indication we're going to go back to whatever normal was in the '80s or early '90s. We're reaching a point where the infrastructure won't be equipped to handle that.""\How to avoid becoming 'that' city\Nashville is notoriously among the most income-segregated communities in the nation, as documented by academic Richard Florida in his 2017 book ""The New Urban Crisis.""\Residents tend to live in areas with socio-economically similar neighbors, in no small part because of the legacy of Jim Crow.\Exacerbating this situation is that the cost of living in Nashville has soared over the last few years because of the area's popularity, job opportunities and lower-tax, lower-cost environment in comparison to major cities like New York or Los Angeles.\That has driven up property values and rents and displaced or squeezed longtime residents and renters from areas that were once blighted, low income and historically African-American.\Buses have heavily served these communities, which are now considered prime real estate near downtown.\Think East Nashville, 12South or Germantown.\""We've been seeing a bit of a ridership loss over the last year or two, and when we try to isolate reasons, one of them when we look at trends by route that's inescapable is gentrification,"" Bland said.\A fully comprehensive transit system could accelerate that displacement because of more expected development, which in recent years has tended to favor higher-income earners.\The fears of these residents getting left behind are not a fantasy.\However, paired with the right land-use policies and development philosophy, a beefed-up transit system could also create an environment that fosters inclusive prosperity.\""We recognized that affordable housing has to be a critical piece and an intentional piece of anything we do regarding transit,"" said Walter Searcy, an attorney, civil rights leader and spokesman for Transit for Nashville.\Transit for Nashville is a group that launched on Sept. 9 to support Mayor Megan Barry's proposed May 2018 referendum, which seeks to pay for a nearly $6 billion comprehensive, regional transit system -- the city's largest transportation investment ever.\""It has to be user-friendly and an alternative, versus a fad or trend, or something just for the upper middle class,"" Searcy said. ""Nashville won't be an 'it' city for long -- it will be 'that' city -- if we don't have a transportation policy that advances affordable housing stock.""\Voters must weigh these considerations as they prepare for the proposed referendum, a measure that deserves active and thoughtful debate, participation and engagement.\Among the other things to consider is that if Nashville does not invest in a robust transit system, it will get left behind its peer cities like Denver, Indianapolis, Charlotte, N.C., or Austin, Texas.\They will have an advantage in attracting businesses, talent and tourists -- as well as headquarters opportunities, like the one tech giant Amazon is now offering cities.\Could Music City attract Amazon?\On Sept. 7 Amazon made available its request for proposals to cities and regions that would like to host its second headquarters on 8.1 million square feet and create 50,000 jobs.\The company is being very specific about what it wants, and here's how Nashville fares:\A metropolitan area of more than 1 million people: Check -- the Nashville metropolitan statistical area has a population of 1.8 million.\A stable and business-friendly environment: Check.\Proximity to a population center: Check -- Nashville, Franklin and Murfreesboro, among them.\Proximity to an international airport: Check -- Nashville International Airport, which just gained a nonstop flight to London.\Proximity to major highways: Check -- I-65, I-24, I-40, I-440, I-840 and several pikes and corridors.\Access to mass transit: not so much.\Transit in Nashville today consists of city and regional buses and one commuter rail line, the 11-year-old Music City Star, which extends from downtown Nashville east to Lebanon.\Bus ridership has been slowly declining, although Music City Star ridership has been on the rise.\Still, transit ridership in the region is 1.3 percent, according to the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce's 2016 Vital Signs report.\Compare that to 3.1 percent in Atlanta, 4.5 percent in Denver or 9.6 percent in Seattle, the site of Amazon's original headquarters.\""Our peer cities are all building systems -- Charlotte, Austin, Indy, Raleigh -- they're all moving ahead of us,"" said Jo Ann Graves, president and CEO of the Transit Alliance of Middle Tennessee and former mayor of Gallatin.\""When it comes to being able to recruit industries to come here and provide good jobs for our citizens, it puts us at a disadvantage not to be on equal footing with our peer cities,"" she said.\The Amazon application is due on Oct. 19, and Amazon will make a decision in 2018.\However, as Graves indicated, other cities have already been actively making investments in their transit systems for years and asking voters for support.\The vast majority of the transit referendums proposed across the country in 2016 passed, including major investments in Los Angeles, Seattle and Atlanta, according to the Center for Transportation Excellence, a group that monitors, promotes and provides information about transit projects.\The success rate varied between 68 percent and 73 percent from 2013 to 2016.\""There's been a lack of leadership at the federal level,"" said Joseph Kane, senior research analyst and associate fellow for the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit public policy organization.\""Cities and states can't wait -- they can't keep kicking the can down the road.""\The fear of getting left behind\Talk to a bus rider or a Lyft or Uber driver, and the topic of the rising cost of living inevitably comes up.\It is not just a feeling. The data confirms what they think.\The Nashville Chamber of Commerce's Vital Signs report has shown a significant cost of living increase from 2013 through 2016.\The 2013 report showed that Nashville's cost of living fell below the national average and was less than other cities like Louisville, Ky., Charlotte and Raleigh, N.C.\By 2016 Nashville's cost of living surpassed all those cities and was near the national average.\That is why community advocates fear that they will be left behind if a new, better transit system comes.\Kutonia Smith-Bond, 27, is an organizer for Music City Riders United who advocates on issues of access and service for MTA riders -- nearly two-thirds of whom depend on the bus system to get around.\""I ride the bus almost every day,"" Smith-Bond said. ""I have a big problem with housing -- it's highly expensive.""\Smith-Bond, who has a child and another on the way, is feeling the financial crunch that many other riders are going through. She is considering moving to Crossville, about 115 miles east of Nashville, because of the cost of living.\She is not happy with how Nashville is growing, and she is concerned that lower-income people will not be able to afford to ride the transit system of the future.\""A lot of people are going to be displaced out of their house or lose their business,"" she said. ""A lot of people are going to lose their livelihoods.""\Nashville's boom has already proved to be cruel to those who can't afford the rising cost of living.\The affordable housing stock continues to diminish as old houses are torn down and replaced by much more expensive and denser homes in the inner core.\Barry's housing report released this year identifies the need for 31,000 units of affordable rental units to be built by 2025.\""Affordable"" means that a household is paying 30 percent or less of income on housing.\Even with the Barnes Affordable Housing Trust Fund -- named after the late affordable housing champion the Rev. Bill Barnes -- to offer incentives to developers, Nashville has produced about 1,000 affordable units in the last two years.\That said, Barry has significantly increased investment to the Barnes Fund and pledged $10 million a year (plus a one-time extra $5 million grant), and Metro is looking to find a partner to create the city's first community land trust.\Concerns over equity and housing, jobs, incoming inequality and transportation spurred the creation of the People's Alliance for Transit, Housing and Employment.\PATHE comprises four community organizations: Democracy Nashville, Homes for All Nashville, Music City Riders United (Smith-Bond's group) and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 123.\PATHE insists that it will support a major transit system only if its members are able to use it.\From Sunday to Tuesday, the group held marches and demonstrations, culminating in a rally at Public Square in front of City Hall on Tuesday to stop the ""gentrification train.""\How we got here\There remain bitter memories of the Amp, former Mayor Karl Dean's ill-fated proposal to build a bus rapid transit line connecting West End and East Nashville.\Opposition from lawmakers, right-wing advocates and neighbors effectively killed the project, which would have been funded by $174 million in federal money.\Bland, the MTA and RTA CEO, was hired in 2014 as the Amp saga was concluding.\He officially made the recommendation to the MTA board to stop pursuing the project in January 2015.\He recalls that a combination of factors undermined the project, but two notable themes emerged:\""The perception was, 'You didn't talk to enough folks, enough communities, neighborhoods,' "" Bland said. ""Others (said): 'Is this it? Is there a broader system?' ""\Major transit project talk has come in fits and starts over the years in Nashville, Bland said, but this time, instead of retreating, Metro decided it could not ignore the need.\Thus, nMotion, a community engagement and strategic planning process, was officially born in March 2015.\In August 2016, a $6 billion, 25-year comprehensive transit proposal came out of the nMotion engagement.\Based upon community input, the proposal aimed for a comprehensive system rather than a simple upgrade.\That would include light rail along the Charlotte, Murfreesboro, Nolensville and Gallatin corridors as well as from North Nashville to Clarksville.\There would be more bus rapid transit options, more frequency, greater connections between surrounding counties, and buses on the shoulders of highways, where they would be unimpeded by traffic.\The MTA and RTA boards adopted the plan soon after.\In August 2015 the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce announced a new initiative called Moving Forward, made up of business, community and faith leaders, to study and invest in the transit landscape and make recommendations to local and state leaders.\They connected with tens of thousands of residents, learned about transit finance and became ambassadors for the transit system, because they saw a need for economic development purposes, recruitment and retention of a qualified workforce, and enhancing quality of life.\Moving Forward released its recommendations supporting regional transit solutions in August.\Among the recommendations were software updates and complementing the nMotion plan by carrying out a pilot program with autonomous, or unmanned, vehicles.\Vanderbilt University economist and professor Malcolm Getz would prefer a massive transit investment to go into emerging ride-sharing technologies and the budding autonomous vehicle revolution instead of rail, and he cited examples of embracing that technology in San Francisco and Columbus, Ohio.\""We have a new set of transportation technologies,"" Getz said. ""They create new opportunities for how we can improve urban mobility and be an urban city of the future.""\His colleague, Craig Philip in the civil and environmental engineering department, however, supports the nMotion proposal and cautions on relying alone on insufficiently tested innovations.\""Autonomous vehicles -- we have no idea how fast that's going to unfold and what the impact will be,"" he said. ""I think people that say, 'Don't worry, be happy, autonomy is going to solve everything,' they don't know.""\So, how do you pay for system?\Dedicated funding for transportation in transit has been an issue for Tennessee and other states for some time.\There was a breakthrough in early 2017 when the Tennessee General Assembly passed the IMPROVE Act, Gov. Bill Haslam's plan to fund a $10 billion backlog of road projects in all the state's 95 counties over 13 years by raising the gas tax, raising or creating other taxes and fees, and making some tax cuts.\A significant part of the legislation gave several populous counties, including Davidson, Williamson, Rutherford, Montgomery, Wilson and Sumner (though not Cheatham, Dickson, Maury or Robertson), the right to hold a countywide referendum to raise money for a transit system.\Voters are increasingly being asked to pay for transit improvements, expansions and construction in other parts of the country.\The federal government has been in gridlock on this issue, and the campaign promise by President Donald Trump to deliver a $1 trillion infrastructure investment has not yet materialized.\In Tennessee, there is a limited pool of money that counties can draw from.\Tennessee has no earned income tax and its investment income tax, the Hall Tax, is being phased out by 2022.\Available sources include local taxes on sales, vehicles, businesses, hotels and motels, and residential development.\In April Barry announced in her State of Metro address the 2018 referendum and that Gallatin Pike would be the site of the first light-rail investment because of the corridor's mass ridership.\Barry plans to release more details about specific projects to be funded and how they will be funded in October.\County and city mayors are watching Nashville's referendum closely, although no other Middle Tennessee county so far has committed to holding a vote on transit.\Williamson County is focused on trying to hold a referendum early next year on raising the sales tax to pay for building future schools.\So it may be years before it gets to the transit funding debate, something affirmed by Williamson Mayor Rogers Anderson at the Aug. 23 POWER of 10 regional summit, organized by Cumberland Region Tomorrow, a group that advocates for land-use, planning and transportation solutions in Middle Tennessee.\""The other counties are interested in seeing the outcomes of Davidson County,"" said Carol Hudler, CEO of Cumberland Region Tomorrow.\""They need to do something to solve transit for them,"" she said. ""They figure if Davidson can't get something passed, then they'll have to rethink how it goes to them.\""If Nashville can fix some of their mobility issues because they can pay for it, maybe it can be more attractive for some of the other counties,"" she added.\Donelson, Lebanon frontiers\Transit-oriented development is already part of the Nashville area's future, and a new law will accelerate those projects.\Earlier this year, the Tennessee General Assembly passed the bipartisan Transit-Oriented Redevelopment Act, sponsored by Sen. Steve Dickerson, R-Nashville, and Rep. Darren Jernigan, D-Nashville, which allows public agencies to carry out and encourage mixed-use development in ""transit-deficient areas.""\The Music City Star line is now driving projects that will significantly transform areas from Donelson to Lebanon, adding to density, walkability, mixed-use development, and the flow of businesses and amenities that follow such investments.\Ridership is growing on the Music City Star, having increased by nearly 10 percent between the 2015 and 2017 fiscal years, from 259,150 riders to 283,114.\The six stations are at the downtown riverfront, Donelson, Hermitage, Mt. Juliet, Martha and Lebanon.\The Hamilton Springs transit-oriented 1,800- to 2,500-unit development is already underway in Lebanon, and that will create a seventh station.\In addition, 155 apartment units are planned for the Mt. Juliet station.\Donelson, which went from rural to suburban decades ago, is now on track to become a new urban center.\""Donelson will be the first transit-oriented development of Davidson County,"" said District 15 Councilman Jeff Syracuse, a leader in this effort to transform the community, known affectionally as ""Hip Donelson.""\The 37214 ZIP code, which includes Donelson, is one of the hottest real estate markets in the nation, and Syracuse said sustainable, smart growth is key.\""It's been a challenge of communicating it to people of why the change is important, of why Donelson is truly of regional importance to all of Middle Tennessee,"" he said.\""If you do it through transit and not through development sprawl, you have smart growth,"" he added.\In August the advocacy group Transit NOW held its summer mixer on the Music City Star, getting off at Donelson, the first stop east of downtown.\That was by design.\The land outside the Star's Donelson stop is owned by the RTA, which put out a request for proposals for companies that want a long-term lease to build a mixed-use transit-oriented development there.\In April Pennrose Properties earned the contract and has two years to develop what its concept will be.\This is not something that happened overnight; in fact, it took years for the pieces to come together to turn Donelson into what is expected to become the second development zone in Davidson County after downtown Nashville.\While Syracuse sees a radical transformation ahead, anchored by a planned public library, he said he supports efforts to preserve existing 20th-century homes, which have attracted people to the community.\The community's feel and affordability, and proximity to downtown, have drawn many young families there.\""What the future of Donelson is going to be is something everybody's going to be proud of,"" the councilman said.\The easternmost stop of the Music City Star is in Lebanon, which is experiencing its own issues with traffic.\""The biggest problems we face now are certainly growth,"" said Lebanon Mayor Bernie Ash. ""The growth in Nashville is tremendous. It's coming this way for us.""\Ash has been on the job for nine months -- having in 2016 defeated incumbent Phillip Craighead, who had been a proponent of regional transit.\Ash said while he still must get up to speed on transit plans and proposals, he knows transit must be a solution for his community in Wilson County.\""I don't think we're going to have much of a choice,"" he said. ""Like most people, I love my car, my truck, I want to get in and go where I want to go. Commuting in between back and from Lebanon and Nashville, I don't know how long we'll be able to do that as we do. The roads can only handle so much.""\Ash, who served as a county commissioner and city councilor for nearly two decades, has seen referendums fail in the past and he wonders how the Nashville one will do.\""They don't trust us with good cause,"" he said about elected officials. ""The common thought is if we vote ourselves a sales tax then we'll vote another tax on top of that.""\However, he said he is aware of the stakes involved.\""Growth does not pay for itself,"" he emphasized.\Avoiding congestion, gaining personal time\Building a transit system is not just about buses and trains, although those are the most visual representations of such a system.\It is about creating access for people who do not want to drive or who might not otherwise be able to get around because they cannot afford a car, because they are disabled, can no longer drive or are too young to get a driver's license.\The myth exists that a transit system will reduce congestion, but since congestion is demand based and people tend to drive more when it gets easier to drive, what transit does is offer an alternative that is reliable and, ideally, more frequent.\Jacy Baggett, a 24-year-old Louisiana State University graduate, works in downtown Nashville as a digital strategist and prefers to take the bus because of convenience, the high cost of parking and to avoid dealing with the frustration of driving in growing congestion.\""It's been over a year when I started, I wanted it as an option,"" she said. ""I could take my car or I could take my bus. Now, it's become an everyday thing. I don't even consider the option of taking my car.\""Do you want to spend your time gridlocked in traffic in a car or in a bus gaining personal time? You're saving resources and gaining personal time,"" she said.\A big complaint surrounding Nashville's buses is that they are not frequent enough and that the present hub-and-spoke system requires people to come into downtown to the Music City Central station and transfer to a different bus to get to another part of town.\That extends commute times.\Bland said there are plans in the works to create another bus station south of downtown.\In addition, the first-mile, last-mile problem is a significant obstacle in Nashville, where not every neighborhood has sidewalks and where walking distance to the bus stop may be significant. That can be especially daunting with Nashville's hot summers and occasional hard rain showers.\'It's all about access'\MTA is not waiting for next year's referendum to create some momentum on a modern transit system that will ease that first-mile, last-mile challenge.\Earlier this year, the MTA board awarded contracts to tech companies TransLoc and DemandTrans to create pilots, which will launch next spring and will use 21st-century technology to improve a 20th-century transit system.\The service would allow people to use an app to call ride-hailing services, like Lyft, Uber or Hytch, or cabs to take them to bus stops or to their final destinations.\""A piece of the future technology: How do we use it to open up access to those options that you and I would take for granted?"" Bland said.\MTA rider data show that 80 percent of passengers have smartphones -- a figure that has been growing annually.\The rides potentially could be subsidized for low-income riders.\And, while apps such as Lyft or Uber require a credit card, the MTA program would allow debit cards or accounts that riders could replenish with cash.\An integrated system that includes convenient, frequent car rides connecting to the transit system increases access.\""If at the end of the day, all we've done is shave 10 minutes off the trip from Murfreesboro to Nashville, we haven't succeeded,"" Bland said. ""It's about that access.""\Nashville voters will be more inclined to support a transit system that benefits their wants and needs.\If the referendum proposal speaks to those issues, the likelihood of passage is high.\Conversely, if it does not, all of Nashville risks getting left further behind.\David Plazas is the opinion and engagement director for the USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee and opinion and engagement editor for The Tennessean.

129,"Local sports teams among those that hear gambling tale\By JESSICA HOPP\Staff Writer\Michael Franzese's hand was cut and bleeding, symbolic of the blood covenant he had entered into.\In his cupped palms burned a prayer card, a saint lit aflame in front of a ring of men that was to become his lifelong brotherhood.\In a darkened room he heard these words: ""Your allegiance to La Cosa Nostra is bound by blood. Should you ever violate this oath your blood will be shed.""\It was Halloween 1975. At 24, Franzese was no longer just a young man, he was a sworn member of the Colombo crime family -- a mobster.\""I vividly remember that night,"" he said. ""I became a part of what my dad was a part of, and it meant a lot. I belonged to a union of men. It was exhilarating.""\At the height of his mob involvement, Franzese's gas tax schemes and sports gambling scams brought in between $6 million and $7 million a day.\In 1985 he was indicted on charges of racketeering, extortion, embezzlement and conspiracy. He served less than four years of his 10-year prison sentence, but was sent back in 1991 for violating probation.\His warnings are credible\There is a lot he would forget if he could, but his experiences have made him a credible source on the dark side of sports gambling and the devastating tailspin it can create.\Just before his release in 1995, the FBI asked him to help make a video warning about the mob's influence in sports. It launched his career as a motivational speaker.\Many college and professional teams want their athletes to hear his message.\""Intimidation is one of the great weapons on the street,"" Franzese said, ""and you can be sure athletes do get in trouble for gambling, they do get involved with organized crime and they will compromise the outcome of the game if necessary.""\Perhaps it is his connection to the mob, a life so often romanticized in the movies, but his experiences seem to make athletes actually listen.\""Gambling is already a serious problem because it is so accepted,"" said Middle Tennessee State baseball coach Steve Peterson, who listened in as Franzese spoke to MTSU athletes earlier this year. ""The best way to combat it is to provide information -- giving the players life stories and bringing in people who are not BS-ing them. People who say, 'Here it is. Look what happened to me. I survived. Here's my tale.' ""\Franzese has recounted his tale for thousands of NCAA athletes, including those at Vanderbilt and MTSU. He has advised NBA stars such as LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony and has visited many major-league baseball clubhouses.\""He comes in and tells you how it is,"" said Nashville Sounds pitcher Dana Eveland, who has heard Franzese speak twice. ""I think his act is clean enough to trust him and believe what he says. I don't think he wants to go back to jail.""\Athletes at risk, he says\A lot of athletes, Franzese said, simply don't understand the dangers of gambling.\""Many athletes are prone to gambling because of the rush and the excitement of raising the stakes in their competition, but they are naive,"" he said.\""They know about the sport they are in, but they don't understand the consequences of hanging around with people that gamble, and they are easy targets in many cases. That's why they need to be educated and informed.""\Franzese, who detailed his underworld life in his books Quitting the Mob and Blood Covenant, said he thought nothing of applying a little pressure to an athlete when the gaming didn't go his way.\""You are given two choices: You get the money or we are going to tell you how to pay us back,"" Franzese said. ""That's basically what they are told. And if it comes to compromising the outcome of a game or giving us information we ask them to, then that's the deal.""\He said he spent many nights in New York clubs making connections within his betting ring.\""Someone would come in and say, 'You will never guess who my daughter's going out with. She's going out with the quarterback' "" at a certain college, Franzese said. ""And then we would get close to him. We would invite him out, say hello to him. Things like that happened all the time.""\The relationship never ended with a few drinks. Once in, it was hard to get out. The athlete was threatened with exposure, told that his illegal sports betting could be uncovered to coaches, school administrators, the media.\""It was business,"" Franzese said. ""And it is not easy for me to say this: I took kind of a cold position on it -- 'You shouldn't have gotten involved. You're involved. Now you have to pay. This is the way it is.'\""Of course, I look at it a lot differently now.""\Problem difficult to fight\It's been years since Franzese was involved with that life. Years since he was released from prison. Years since he did the unthinkable and left the mob by packing up his family and moving across the country.\He said that if he were to show up in the wrong place at the wrong time he probably would be killed. It's one reason he doesn't disclose his travel schedule.\Franzese said it's important that he keep sharing his experiences because he sees a problem that will only get more difficult to fight.\""When I was doing my thing there was no Internet, they weren't touting poker on television like they are now, and there weren't 46 or 47 other states that had legalized gambling,"" he said. ""Now it's everywhere. It's very easy to gamble. You can gamble anywhere you want within five minutes of your own home or you can gamble sitting in your own home. Kids were never exposed to it the way they are now.\""You have no idea how quickly things can turn in your life and how fast you can lose it if you are doing the wrong thing. I was doing the wrong thing. There is absolutely no upside to being involved with gambling. That you can be sure.""\Pro athletes know dangers, but walk a fine line\By JESSICA HOPP\Staff Writer\What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas if you're a regular Joe.\It's a bit more complicated if you're a professional athlete and you can see the lights of Sin City from your apartment.\Before joining the Nashville Kats, Frank Carter played three years for the Las Vegas Gladiators. To make sure he didn't run afoul of the Arena Football League's no-gambling policy, he spent those three years watching his back.\""They could come and play like they are just a friend or a fan, but they could really be someone looking to get an edge,"" Carter said. ""They could say, 'How is this team doing? Who's playing this week or who's starting?' So you have to watch yourself.""\While the NCAA prohibits its athletes from gambling, each professional league has its own gambling policy.\Most professional athletes are prohibited from betting on their own sport, but are not necessarily banned from betting on others.\Nashville Sounds pitcher Dana Eveland said he knows baseball players who bet on horse racing and other competitions. He said it was done within the clubhouse and not through bookies.\""That stuff still goes on, but I don't know that it's as big a deal,"" Eveland said. ""The main policy is not betting on baseball and not letting betting be public, period. I think gambling on your own sports is bad. It is putting yourself in bad situation, especially on your own team.""\Tennessee Titans veteran tight end Erron Kinney said he'll bet with a teammate when alma maters are involved, but those wagers are usually for a meal.\""We have fun with that,"" he said, ""but that's more the competitive nature of the guys and having a little school pride.""\As for being asked to throw a game, professional athletes are presumably less susceptible than their college counterparts because they often receive a substantial salary.\Kinney said he believes most pros are mature enough to understand the consequences of throwing a game or shaving points.\""I think you have to find a pro who is in a really desperate situation for them to do something like that,"" Kinney said. ""That, or somebody who was just so overconfident in their ability to control a game. But it would be so insanely selfish and gross.""\Pro sports has had its share of gambling-related scandals.\Pete Rose was permanently banned from baseball in 1989 for gambling on sports. He later admitted to betting on the Cincinnati Reds when was their manager.\""It is a sad situation to see what he has been through, but now we know what will happen,"" said Eveland.\Phoenix Coyotes associate coach Rick Tocchet was arrested this year on charges of financing a betting operation. Tocchet and two others -- businessman James Ulmer and former state trooper James Harney -- were accused of running a gambling ring that handled $1.7 million in bets on pro and college sports in the six weeks leading up to the Super Bowl.\Ulmer and Harney have already pleaded guilty. No bettors where charged.\""Tocchet is a very good friend of mine,"" said former Nashville Predator Jim McKenzie. ""My first reaction was disbelief. I still don't believe it.""\LEAGUE POLICIES ON GAMBLING\National Football League: Players can't associate with gamblers or with gambling activities in a manner that brings discredit to the NFL.\National Hockey League: Bans bets on hockey but does not specifically ban bets on other sports.\Arena Football League: Players cannot bet on or attempt to throw or fix any AFL game.\National Basketball Association: Players and coaches are barred from gambling on the NBA.\Major League Baseball: No specific policy regarding betting on other sports.

Rick Neuheisel. Boston College. Tulane. Arizona State.\All are examples of how NCAA athletes, coaches and programs are neither immune to the allure nor impervious to the effects of sports gambling.\""It is a serious problem,"" Middle Tennessee State baseball Coach Steve Peterson said. ""The first time you go to a poker game or bet on a sports team you don't expect to become hooked, but winning is a tremendous rush whether it's baseball or playing cards. Gambling is so accepted, it can happen to anybody.""\It is against NCAA regulations for athletes, coaches or sports administrators to bet on a sporting event or affect the outcome of a game.\College athletes tempted\In 2003 the NCAA examined the gambling behavior of its student athletes -- approximately 21,000 male and female athletes participated in a survey anonymously -- and released the results of its study in May 2004.\About 35 percent of the males and 10 percent of the females reported betting on a college sporting event during the previous year.\With the hype and interest surrounding college championships such as basketball's March Madness, luring an athlete into gambling activities would seem like a layup.\""Tempted? Yes. It's so easy to get caught up in that just because a lot of people say, 'Who's going to win? I'll bet you $20,' "" Vanderbilt women's basketball player Dee Davis said. ""Then you have to stop yourself and say, 'Wait, I can't do that.' It may seem harmless to them, but it could have a lot greater consequences.""\The NCAA also discovered that its athletes were participating in some extreme behaviors associated with sports gambling. According to the study, some athletes said:\* They had taken money in exchange for playing poorly in a game.\* They knew of a teammate who took money in exchange for playing poorly in a game.\* They had been threatened or harmed because of sports wagering.\* They had been contacted by an outside source requesting inside information, or they had provided inside information.\More education on way\Division I football and men's basketball players were the worst offenders, the study showed.\Out of 2,132 football players, 102 admitted to engaging in at least one of the extreme behaviors, including 23 who said they took money in exchange for playing poorly.\Of the 388 men's basketball players surveyed, 17 said they had engaged in at least one of the extreme behaviors. Two said they took money in exchange for playing poorly.\""It is definitely of concern to the NCAA and particularly with the recent explosive growth of gambling as a whole,"" said Rachel Newman-Baker, director of agent, gambling and amateurism activities for the NCAA. ""Sports wagering demeans the competition and competitors alike by a message that is contrary to the purposes and meaning of sport.""\Newman-Baker said the study prompted the NCAA to launch a campaign for increased education and awareness about the evils of sports gambling. A follow-up study is scheduled for 2007-08, she said.\Problem is widespread\History shows gambling issues aren't limited to major sports in major conferences.\""It's the same anywhere you go,"" said quarterback Antonio Heffner, who in January transferred from South Carolina to Tennessee State. ""When it all boils down, it's about the money. It doesn't matter where the school is.""\Vanderbilt administrators speak with athletes individually and in small groups to discourage such thinking, Commodores basketball player Dan Cage said.\""My advice to guys coming into college athletics is, outside of playing cards with your buddies on a Friday night, keep your money in your pocket. Then you'll be all right.""\PAST COLLEGE SPORTS BETTING SCANDALS\1961: St. Joseph's forfeited third-place NCAA Tournament finish after a student-athlete was accused of gambling involvement.\1981: Former Boston College basketball player Rick Kuhn and four others were found guilty of participating in a point-shaving scandal.

The networks agreed.\Before the past season's Super Bowl, outgoing NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he always insisted that the league have no association with gambling.\""I think our record on this whole issue has been pretty clear, pretty consistent, going back to the '60s,"" Tagliabue said. ""We are continuing very strongly to support legislation that would ban Internet sports gambling. ...\""We all know the history of games that were influenced in college sports. I played in a basketball game in college that was fixed, quote unquote, by the opposing team. So there are insidious elements of gambling that have led us, and will continue to lead us, to have a very clear separation, to the extent it's within our means, between our game and gambling on sports.""\That separation does not extend to the Arena Football League. Many of its teams, owned by or associated with owners in the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball, seem to embrace gambling businesses.\Several AFL teams have sponsorships from BetUS.com, AlamoPoker.com and GoldenPalace.com, plus a handful of casinos.

The same people will profit.\Tekprof: The solution, MominTN, to that problem is to just make it all legal. We have got to stop legislating morality.

Retired. He has a wife, a nice house, grown kids and a dog. He drives a new car, goes on exotic vacations, plays golf most afternoons and goes to church on Sundays.\He is a sports bookie, and Sgt. Steve Reed of the Metro Police Gambling Control Unit is trying to bring him in.\The problem is, bookies don't hand out business cards or advertise in the newspaper. And most are good people.\""Upstanding citizens,"" said Reed, who has been with the gambling control unit for three years. ""They live a pretty normal life other than their big profit.""\That doesn't make them immune to the law, but it does make them harder to catch.\Focus is on bigger crimes\Gambling is illegal in Tennessee. Any person found making a wager is subject to prosecution.\Detectives are not going after the accountant betting in the office pool, however.\""The punishment would be so minute,"" Reed said. ""In a lot of the courts judges are not going to sentence a person taking hard-earned money and placing it on a Tennessee-Georgia football game. It is not a crime.""\The crime is organizing those bettors, taking their wagers and profiting.\Reed said the gambling control unit's investigation period normally begins with the start of the football season and ends around the Super Bowl. That's when detectives try to infiltrate as many gambling networks as possible. Reed said Metro brought in about 10 sports bookies during the 2005 investigation period.\On the federal level, sentencing guidelines used to require mandatory jail time. In January 2005 that changed to an advisory giving federal judges more discretion in sentencing.\In Tennessee, sports betting is considered a misdemeanor. Jail time, if given, would not exceed 30 days. Most offenders don't even get that.\""I can't think of any state defendants I represented doing any jail time,"" said Peter Strianse, a Nashville criminal defense attorney.\The sentence often includes probation, but the bookies take a harder hit in the wallet.\""I was involved in a sports gambling case three or four years ago where the seized amount of funds and other assets was a couple of million dollars,"" Strianse said. ""Some assets were clearly tied to illegal activity, and others were murkier. Usually the government gives back something approaching half.""\Reed said Metro had two sizable busts in 2005 with sports betting asset seizures totaling $250,000. Still, he knows a lot of the unit's work can be in vain.\""It's frustrating,"" he said. ""A bookie can be arrested numerous times, but usually he stays in it.

130,"""My first impression of Bill Haslam is exactly the same today as it was then. And my impression of Bill the candidate the first time around, he's the same person leaving office today, which is really remarkable. Political office changes people most of the time. I don't think it's changed Bill.""\Tom Ingram\Longtime Republican political consultant\Surrounded by friends, family, supporters and lawmakers, Gov. Bill Haslam outlined his vision for the state on Jan. 15, 2011.\Standing on a stage across the street from the state Capitol, the Knoxville Republican touted the need to improve Tennessee's standing in education and personal health while vowing to have state government operate within its means.\And he promised to listen.\Now, eight years later, Haslam exits office Saturday with a legacy of accomplishments, advancements and occasional setbacks while contemplating his next move.\His stamp on the state is indelible. It includes implementing a wildly popular tuition-free community college program emulated by a Democratic president.\He successfully managed to raise the state's gas tax for the first time in nearly 30 years, coupled with other tax cuts to help pay for transportation needs, all while overseeing an unprecedented period of growth and record low unemployment.\Like his predecessors, there have been missteps and mistakes — including on health care and how the state cared for children in its custody. But throughout it all, Haslam has managed to remain favorable in the eyes of most Tennesseans, ensuring his standing as the most popular politician right now in Tennessee.\In many ways, Haslam's remarks eight years ago provide an opportunity to review his performance.\""Today a new set of hands will grab hold of those oars and pull with the currents, sometimes against, toward a new horizon,"" Haslam said during his inaugural address.\Haslam took office after spending eight years as the mayor of Knoxville. As he campaigned, he squared off against Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey and then-U.S. Rep. Zach Wamp in the Republican gubernatorial primary.\Haslam ultimately won the party's nomination and ended up handily defeating Democrat Mike McWherter, son of former Gov. Ned McWherter, in the 2010 general election.\His election coincided with Republicans increasing their advantage in the House and Senate. At the time, Haslam and his team did not have established relationships with many lawmakers.\Mark Cate, the governor's former chief of staff, said Haslam was learning the basics of how the legislature functions during the early days of the administration. Cate said that when Haslam took office they were on their heels, in part because of Ramsey — a longtime force at the Capitol.\""Ultimately, the governor built a very strong relationship with Ron,"" Cate said. ""He became an ally.""\""We are honing an edge that will allow Tennessee to stand out in a highly competitive world where everyone is looking for the smallest advantage to succeed.""\Haslam's early years in office came in the midst of the nation's recovery from the Great Recession of 2008. In his first budget, he called for additional funding for the state's Rainy Day Fund, a move he would continue every year during his tenure.\Former U.S. Sen. Bob Corker said Haslam set the tone for people wanting to move to Tennessee.\""He's been a tremendous recruiter for our state,"" Corker said.\To cultivate an environment of job recruitment, Haslam has regularly hosted business executives at the executive residence in Nashville, traveled to other states and countries and worked with the legislature to create a more business friendly environment.\Since Haslam has been in office, about 177,000 job commitments have been announced resulting in $34.7 billion in private capital investment, according to Scott Harrison, spokesman for the state's Department of Economic and Community Development.\His administration has also cut more than $580 million in taxes, ranging from sales tax on groceries to the elimination of the inheritance tax and Hall income tax - a state tax on interest and income from investments that will be phased out in 2021.\""Educational achievement is our real key to the future.""\Haslam's most significant achievement in education has been pioneering the Tennessee Promise and Reconnect programs, which help recent high school graduates and adults attend state community or technical college for free.\The state has been heralded nationally as a leader in those efforts.\""He elevated education in a way that we had never seen before in Tennessee, at least in my tenure,"" said Dale Lynch, executive director of the Tennessee Organization of School Superintendents.\At the same time, he bolstered K-12 education funding, allocating nearly $1.5 billion toward it — including nearly $500 million for teacher salaries — over his two terms.\Tennessee is among the top states in the nation for growth in education funding since the recession, in part due to former Gov. Phil Bredesen's decision not to slash the education budget when revenue plummeted during the recession, said Jim Wrye, a lobbyist for the Tennessee Education Association.\Haslam both maintained and implemented policies that led to Tennessee's schools being among the fastest improving in the country, according to the the National Assessment of Educational Progress.\Haslam frequently puts the gains into perspective, saying the state still falls within the bottom half in the nation on reading and math.\And both Lynch and former U.S. Sen. Bill Frist, a friend of Haslam's, noted that Tennessee's education successes began under Bredesen.\""Whereas most governors would have thrown overboard what the previous governor had done, he built upon it and expanded it to where now Tennessee has high school graduation rates at an all-time high and is the first state in the nation to offer high school graduates two years of community college for free, which had national implications,"" Frist said.\But on Haslam's watch, the state has faced three years of problems with TNReady, the state's online standardized testing platform, recurring issues that have caused disruptions for school districts around the state.\""We can't remain 44th out of the 50 states in the health of our citizens.""\Throughout 2014, Haslam's administration worked with the federal government to try to expand the state's Medicaid system under the Affordable Care Act.\By the end of the year, the administration worked to finalize a plan and the governor called a special session that would begin in January 2015.\The measure, known as Insure Tennessee, would have provided an estimated 280,000 residents with insurance.\At the beginning, Cate said legislative leaders expressed interest and said they wanted to hear more. ""Pretty soon we understood what it's all about — anything about Obamacare and how toxic that was — we knew that's what we're going to be dealing with,"" he said.\Michele Johnson, executive director of the Tennessee Justice Center, a backer of Medicaid expansion, said Haslam approached the issue through the lens of doing what is right.\""Then he did it,"" she said. ""There's less and less of that in American politics.""\Despite the failure of Insure Tennessee, U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander credits Haslam for taking on a politically difficult issue.\""Sometimes when you take on hard things, you don't always succeed,"" Alexander said. ""But I'd rather have a governor who tries to do the hard things ... than one who just ducked it and did nothing.""\""The path we will travel will not be smooth, and there will be a few bumps along the way.""\Haslam, like any elected official, has faced criticism.\In 2012, The Tennessean began what would become a year-long investigation into the unreported deaths of children under the supervision of the Department of Children's Services and its commissioner Kate O'Day, a Haslam appointee with longtime ties to the governor and his family.\Haslam found himself on the defensive as the agency came under criticism for a litany of troubles, including its inability to accurately track child deaths.\The administration also lost its fight to keep secret the records of more than 200 children who died under the department's supervision after The Tennessean filed suit.\But the agency, which was also under supervision by the federal courts, executed a turnaround under new leadership.\""We've moved light-years away from where we were,"" Haslam said in 2017. ""I don't think you'll see Tennessee go back.""\Politically, some Republicans have questioned his credentials as a conservative — he was an early critic of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. Some Democrats have balked at his decision to allow several controversial measures to become law without his signature.\He also faced backlash for a proposal to outsource jobs at the state's public universities and colleges.\""We will make the right decisions that point us toward the future, while doing so with a measure of compassion.""\Although many of his decisions have been controversial, Haslam's backers say he's used a measured approach to reach them.\""He's not an ideologue,"" Johnson said. ""Everybody who knows him knows he's much more interested in doing his job than keeping his job.""\He used such an approach while considering reviewing whether to halt execution that resumed on his watch or grant clemency to Cyntoia Brown, a woman who was sentenced to life in prison for a murder she committed at 16.\As he considered Brown's clemency, Haslam said he tried to put aside the public pressure, which included outcry from celebrities and thousands of phone calls, and simply do the homework on the case.\""As your governor, I promise to be a good listener and a continuous learner.""\Looking back on his time in office, Haslam said he mostly wants Tennesseans to remember him as someone who did the right thing, regardless of politics.\""I really hope it's that we came to solve problems and that it wasn't about our answer or the partisan answer,"" he said during a December interview.\Tom Ingram, a longtime Republican political consultant, first met Haslam in the 1980s when Ingram was working with the Haslam family business, Pilot, as it grew into a national truck stop chain.\""My first impression of Bill Haslam is exactly the same today as it was then,"" Ingram said. ""And my impression of Bill the candidate the first time around, he's the same person leaving office today, which is really remarkable.\""Political office changes people most of the time. I don't think it's changed Bill.""\For Haslam, who had at one point considered becoming a pastor, Ingram said, he viewed the office of governor as its own type of ministerial calling.\""Did he get everything done he could've gotten done? Did he spend all of his political capital?"" Ingram said. ""No. But he got a lot of things done that were important.""\Corker said he's not surprised about Haslam's continued popularity in Tennessee. A poll from Vanderbilt University released last month found his most recent approval rating was 61 percent.\""When you're a good and decent person as he is, when you seek to be fair to all that you deal with, I think in spite of all the things that can occur over an eight year period that you can remain popular,"" Corker said.\""I hope you will join me today along the path that we start blazing that will shape the future for Tennessee.""\In the short term, Haslam is still considering whether to launch a bid for the U.S. Senate seat long held by Alexander, who is not seeking re-election in 2020.\He plans on going on vacation immediately after Gov.-elect Bill Lee's inauguration Saturday and making a decision on the Senate race sometime afterward.\""He's a great public servant. He's the right age,"" Frist said. ""He has tremendous experience as an executive. He knows the needs and wants of the people of Tennessee, which are a great reflection of the nation.""\Eight years ago, Haslam predicted what might be the theme of his time in office.\""You have to be willing to reach out, take a risk and understand that the reward for a job well done comes from knowing that you have played your part with the gifts that God has given you, so that you're a part of something bigger than yourself.""\Anita Wadhwani and Jason Gonzales contributed to this report.\Reach Joel Ebert at jebert@tennessean.com or 615-772-1681.

131,"Tennessee state Rep. John Ray Clemmons says he's running for Nashville mayor, becoming the first candidate to challenge Mayor David Briley in this year's election and unleashing an assault on the incumbent's leadership and vision.\Clemmons, D-Nashville, announced his plans to run in the August mayoral election in an exclusive interview with The Tennessean after months of speculation about a bid.\He framed himself as a stronger, bolder leader than Briley who would more effectively communicate the city's priorities and path forward.\""I'm prepared to provide that strong, decisive leadership that Nashvillians expect and deserve,"" Clemmons said. ""I have a vision for this city that's rooted in our core values of equity, opportunity and justice, and I want to tackle the issues facing our city head-on.""\Clemmons, a 41-year-old attorney elected last year to his third term representing West Nashville's House District 55, pointed to transportation, affordable housing and public education — regarded as three of the city's most pressing issues. He said Briley has fallen short addressing each in his time in office.\""What's lacking in Metro right now is a vision to address the issues facing Nashville,"" Clemmons said.\Out of the gate, his candidacy could find its biggest following among the left. Although Briley is known as a progressive, Clemmons could present an alternative for voters critical of Briley's position on the November referendum creating a community oversight board for police as well as others who have hammered the mayor for reneging on cost-of-living pay increases for Metro workers.\But Clemmons also might look to capitalize on a contrast in styles with Briley, who has taken on a lower-key persona than his predecessor, former Mayor Megan Barry. Clemmons said he would ""bring a new level of energy to the mayor's office.""\""People do expect a level of charisma from their mayor,"" he said. ""On the whole, the mayor is selling the city. In order to recruit businesses and jobs to this city, you have to be somewhat of a salesman and have a personality to be able to communicate your vision for the city.\""Mayor Briley has failed in both of those in A, he doesn't have a vision for the city and B, he can't communicate it.""\Briley, Nashville's onetime vice mayor, was thrust into office in March after Barry resigned amid a sex scandal with her former police bodyguard.\Briley won the office outright in a May special election to finish the final year of Barry's term, avoiding a runoff by securing 54 percent of the vote. He's now running in his second election in as many years to claim a new four-year term.\Other possible mayoral candidates, At-large Councilman John Cooper and Nashville real estate executive Bill Freeman, are expected to make decisions on runs soon.\A sitting Nashville mayor has never lost a re-election bid, but past mayors had full terms under their belts during their re-elections and didn't enter under unusual circumstances like Briley. Some observers see Briley as vulnerable given a year that has seen ups and downs.\Briley has pushed a return to core city services — which he's called ""the fundamentals"" — after winning approval of a new $275 million Major League Soccer stadium and helping land an Amazon operations hub.\But he's attracted criticism over not raising property taxes to pay for employee pay increases, supporting a transit referendum that failed last year and raising concerns about the community oversight board that passed despite his objections.\Clemmons, who will be considered an underdog given Briley's incumbency advantage, could be challenged on fundraising in a race that could cost $1.5 million to compete. Four candidates spent more than $2 million in the 2015 mayor's race that Barry won, but the price tag could be smaller if fewer viable contenders run.\Clemmons declined to say how much money he thinks the race will demand but expressed confidence in his ability to raise enough.\State law permits the transfer of excess campaign funds from his state House campaign committee, which has a balance of $58,941, to his mayoral campaign. He said he would contribute a small amount of personal money into the campaign but didn't say how much.\Although the new state legislative session kicked off last week, Clemmons is allowed under state law to accept campaign contributions from Davidson County during session but not from outside the county until the session adjourns.\Clemmons said he's spent the past few months talking to Nashvillians, calling it ""almost uncanny"" how much they have the same concerns about the city's direction.\His campaign has planned a series of town hall meetings across Nashville over the next month.\On the future of transit in Nashville, Clemmons said he supports identifying a plan with community buy-in and ""skin in the game"" from surrounding counties.\Fresh off defeat in May of a $5.4 billion light rail and transit system, Briley has ruled out pursuing a second transit referendum over his next term if elected. But Clemmons said he would leave a second transit referendum on the table.\""We can't kick the can down the road,"" Clemmons said. ""That's what's lacking in the mayor's office today. We need strong, bold, decisive leadership in making this a priority along with those other issues.\""Writing off a transit referendum for the next four or five years, I think, is completely irresponsible.""\Clemmons also said Metro needs to ""seriously consider"" an increase to the city's property tax rate to pay for its obligations, including education — a contrast to Briley, who's said he's committed to avoiding a tax hike for the second straight year.\Clemmons slammed Briley over affordable housing, saying the mayor was wrong last fall when he declared that affordable housing ""is not a crisis, but it is a significant problem.""\He said Metro needs to make affordable housing a greater budget priority, more aggressively use city-owned property for affordable housing and take advantage of new state laws on the issue.\""Affordable housing in this city is a crisis for too many families. I think trying to describe it as anything else is false and irresponsible.""\Clemmons, a native of Lebanon who practices law at Clemmons and Clemons Law, was first elected in 2014 when he scored an impressive victory by defeating longtime state Rep. Gary Odom in the Democratic primary.\Five years before, Clemmons finished last among four candidates in the Metro Council District 18 special election.\Given the state's Republican supermajorities and his short time in office, Clemmons arguably lacks major legislative victories, but he cited bills regarding education administration and affordable housing as some of his top accomplishments. He also said he ""worked across the aisle"" with Gov. Bill Haslam to pass the state IMPROVE Act, which raised the gas tax to fund transportation projects and created a local option allowing for referendums on transit.\""Those are major accomplishments that I was able to achieve in four short years in the state legislature in the most difficult of environments as a Democrat,"" he said.\Clemmons, married with three children, resides in the Belmont-Hillsboro neighborhood, where he served as the area's neighborhood group president in the past. He attended undergraduate school at Columbia University and law school at the University of Memphis School of Law.\While other candidates might enter, Clemmons said his campaign has a plan that they're ready to execute and believes his positions on the issues ""will be easily contrasted."" His campaign manager is Democratic operative Kat Coffen. He said he would announce a campaign consulting firm at a later time.\""It's always difficult running against an incumbent, who has the bully pulpit, so to speak, but we're prepared to meet those challenges.""\Early voting in the Aug. 1 election begins July 12.\Reach Joey Garrison at jgarrison@tennessean.com or 615-259-8236 and on Twitter @joeygarrison.\State Rep.

133,"DNJ Opinion Column\Although the just completed session of the Tennessee Legislature did little to distinguish itself, Rutherford County officials, and presumably most taxpayers, should be pleased that major state road projects for this community will advance.\Surprised by a budget crisis which occupied most of the legislators' time during the session which concluded at the end of May, members of the House and Senate never really got around to enacting much meaningful legislation although a lot of bills were passed.\Without a funding mechanism, though, many legislative initiatives never had a chance.\Luckily, roads in Tennessee are well-funded. A designated gas tax pays for road building and maintenance. With so many people moving away from energy-saving vehicles and willing to keep them on the road due to relatively low gasoline taxes, funds flowing into road department coffers are the one solid spot in the overall state budget.\While other areas of state service, schools, higher education, environment and health care, must be balanced against one another in slicing up the general state fund which does not increase in accordance with the overall economy and population, roads have the money to keep moving.\As a result, several major road projects in Rutherford County will progress next year. The key ones include widening of congested state Route 96 West (Franklin Road) from I-24 to Overall Creek, and construction of a new I-24 interchange to Elam Road.\Each of those projects will help alleviate or even interdict traffic problems in our community.\While state services will be somewhat stunted in the next year, finding ways to get around should improve. On a daily basis that can indeed be a blessing for each of us.\Congratulations are in order to Oakland High School's Brennan King, chosen in the second round of major league baseball's draft Wednesday.\The Patriot shortstop became the highest draft pick in Rutherford County history as the Los Angeles Dodgers' second pick and the 69th selection overall.\King, a Mississippi State signee, will meet with the Dodgers Monday evening to discuss his future.\If he signs with Los Angeles, he likely will be assigned to the Dodgers' rookie league team. In the event the two parties can't come to terms, then King would maintain his NCAA eligibility and play collegiately for Mississippi State.\Kudos are also in order to the Oakland Patriot baseball team collectively which finished a stellar athletic year for the school by winning the state championship, giving the school two major titles including last fall's football title.\The Patriots have much to be proud about. King has even more to look forward to."
134,"Republican candidates seeking to succeed retiring state Sen. Bill Ketron, R-Murfreesboro, have provided their positions on improving traffic and bringing more high-paying jobs to Rutherford County.\County Mayor Ernest Burgess and state Rep. Dawn White, both of Murfreesboro, are competing in the Aug. 2 Republican primary for a four-year term in the Tennessee Senate District 13 seat.\The GOP winner will face unopposed Democratic primary candidate Kelly Northcut to represent a district that encompasses about two-thirds of Rutherford County, including La Vergne, Smyrna, Eagleville, the Walter Hill community north of Murfreesboro and much of Murfreesboro itself.\Burgess has served as mayor since winning his seat in 2006, and White has represented Tennessee House District 37 since winning her seat in 2012.\Both Republican candidates agreed to respond to questions from The Daily News Journal through email, and the publication will seek a follow up with Northcut.\Burgess: Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet. That said, we can make significant progress on this issue by bringing key stakeholders together. The first step is to ensure that Rutherford County is getting its fair share of TDOT (Tennessee Department of Transportation) funds. I am the candidate in this race with a record of fighting for Rutherford County, and I am the only candidate in this race with a record of proven results for Rutherford County.\White: First, we need to make sure that we continue to pursue important road-improvement projects, but we need to do so without raising taxes on hardworking Tennessee families. I opposed the recent gas tax increase and supported a conservative alternative plan that would have funded road improvements without raising taxes.\Second, we need to continue to look for common sense, inexpensive solutions to reduce traffic congestion. The state should consider allowing state employees to stagger their start times and encourage private employers to do the same. Other solutions to explore include allowing buses to use interstate shoulders and using lanes that reverse directions from the morning to evening rush hours.\Burgess: As mayor, I have worked with the (Rutherford County) Chamber (of Commerce) and others to bring in countless jobs, including those that are high paying. I am the only person in this race with the executive and business background to provide the results needed to bring in more jobs to Rutherford County. As state senator, I will work on providing opportunities to help train a workforce for the high-paying jobs we already have and cut red tape to bring in more jobs.\White: As a former small business owner, I know that government does not create jobs; businesses do. Under conservative Republican leadership in the legislature, we've reduced taxes and regulations, and our economy has flourished. In fact, Tennessee was recently named as the number one state in the nation in small business job growth. As state senator, I will continue to work to cut burdensome regulations and red tape, and help make Tennessee and Rutherford County the best possible environment for new businesses to locate and for existing businesses to thrive.\Reach Scott Broden through email at sbroden@dnj.com, phone at 615-278-5158 or on Twitter @ScottBroden.\CREDIT: Scott Broden"
135,"Help untangle Tennessee's traffic problems\By JEFF BARRIE\Would you like less traffic congestion, less sprawl, cleaner skies and a more balanced transportation system in Tennessee? If so, I have some good news for you: Right now, Tennesseans have a terrific chance to help shape the future of our state.\The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) is developing a 25-year plan to establish priorities for Tennessee's transportation investments for decades to come. It is a ""multi-modal plan,"" which means it considers all forms of transportation and sets goals for each, including highways, public transportation, rail projects, airports, waterways, bicycle lanes and pedestrian needs.\TDOT wants to hear from you. The agency understands that public involvement in the earliest stages of planning will result in a more successful plan. It is up to each of us to participate, and at the end of this column, I will provide simple instructions for you to get involved today. But first, here are some facts:\Tennessee's metro areas currently rank near the top of the nation in commute times and traffic congestion (according to Federal Highway Administration data), and we experience some of the worst air pollution in America. If current trends continue, these problems may grow worse in the coming years.\We can do better. What is your vision?\How would you change transportation in Tennessee? How would you spend your gas tax dollars for the next quarter century? Do you desire more highways? Do you wish for convenient passenger rail service from Memphis to Tri-Cities? Would you like thousands of trucks moved from the highways onto a better freight rail system? Would you benefit from an improved public transportation system? Would you promote bicycle and pedestrian friendly communities and roadways? Are you concerned about sprawl consuming Tennessee's farmland and natural, cultural and historic wonders?\All of these issues are being addressed in TDOT's long-range transportation plan, giving us a chance to build a more effective, environmentally and fiscally sound transportation system in Tennessee.\Under the leadership of Gov. Phil Bredesen and Transportation Commissioner Gerald Nicely, TDOT is asking for public input on an unprecedented scale. According to Nicely, there has never been a more extensive public input effort undertaken by our state. The TDOT Web site explains why: ""Your participation in the plan process is critical for making sure the changing needs of Tennessee's communities and people are met.""\Unfortunately, only a small percentage of citizens are participating. Of more than 5 million Tennesseans, TDOT has received fewer than 2,000 comments since last spring. This is a good start, but we can do better.\Don't miss your chance. Share your views with TDOT today. (See instructions in accompanying box.)\The plan will shape Tennessee's environment and communities for the next quarter century and beyond. Let's build a future that reflects the needs - and the vision - of all Tennesseans.\Jeff Barrie is a member of TDOT's Long-Range Plan Statewide Steering Committee, coordinator of Citizens for TDOT Reform and board member of Trust for the Future."
136,"The August primary election is behind us now, and Tennesseans have narrowed their choices for senator, governor, and federal and state legislators. The general election candidates may be tempted to pick wedge issues to drive their turnout. However, if they are really committed to public service and the greater good, they should address those things that affect Tennesseans' daily lives.\They should also be able to explain to voters how they can and will do something about it.\Issues like immigration have dominated news coverage, and a June Gallup poll showed Americans consider immigration the No. 1 problem facing America.\However, remember, the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,000 miles from Nashville.\That is why the people running to lead Tennesseans ought to focus on the critical issues closest to home.\Here are a few topics for candidates to consider:\Our leaders need to ensure that Tennessee's economy stays strong.\That means ensuring access to jobs, a climate that will be inviting to business relocations and opportunities to benefit from a global economy.\Bipartisan groups of elected officials agree President Trump's tariff policy is detrimental to segments of our economy, like Tennessee farmers or auto manufacturers.\Agricultural production generates more than $3 billion annually, per the Tennessee Department of Agriculture.\Eighty-seven of Tennessee's 95 counties have auto operations. Nearly 1,000 auto suppliers are in the state and 135,000 Tennesseans work in the industry. Exports approach $6 billion annually.\Our leaders must also finally make progress on the Memphis Regional Megasite.\Another important factor for leaders to consider is Tennessee's environment, its rivers, mountains and green spaces, which make it such an attractive tourism destination. This is also good for the health of the economy, residents and visitors.\Nashville is the private hospital capital of the United States, but Tennessee has some of the worst health outcomes in the nation.\In fact, Tennessean children are now the heaviest in the nation.\Tennessee also has the second-highest level of opioid prescriptions per capita in the nation, and the fatalities from overdoses grow every year.\Earlier this year, the Tennessee General Assembly passed Gov. Bill Haslam's $30 million investment in opioid regulation, law enforcement and treatment.\It is a good step, but that only starts to address the scope of the problem.\In 2017, President Trump declared an opioid emergency, and our members of Congress need to make sure Tennessee is getting the money and assistance to address this crisis.\Another emergency is that Tennessee now has the highest per capita rate of rural hospital closures in the country.\McKenzie Regional Hospital near Jackson will become the latest casualty.\Tennessee legislators have refused to expand Medicaid in the state, but they have pursued no other alternatives to this problem, and our vulnerable residents need access to quality health care.\Despite excellent schools across the state like University of Tennessee Knoxville, Vanderbilt University and University of Memphis, too few Tennesseans have a degree to place them in the jobs of today and tomorrow, which require more skills and training.\We are making progress through programs like the Tennessee Promise, Tennessee Reconnect, and the Drive to 55, which make a community college or technical school education virtually free. College graduation and participation rates are rising, but there is still a long way to go.\However, the disparities between low-income and higher income students create barriers to access.\While Haslam has increased teacher pay and investments in public schools, local districts say it is not enough, which is why Metro Nashville Public Schools joined a lawsuit with Shelby County schools to sue for more money.\A landmark success for the Haslam administration was getting the bipartisan IMPROVE Act passed, which raised the gas tax and is building needed road projects in the state.\That will help address the backlog, but there are future needs.\As Tennessee as a whole continues to grow in population — at a rate of about 0.86 percent a year — residents and businesses need to build infrastructure to deal with that growth.\Investments in roadways, transit, sidewalks and communities will go a long way.\Opinion and Engagement Editor David Plazas wrote this editorial on behalf of the USA TODAY NETWORK Tennessee.\David Plazas\Columnist\Nashville Tennessean\USA TODAY NETWORK – TENN.\David Plazas\Columnist\Nashville Tennessean\USA TODAY NETWORK – TENN."

However, Trump prompted him, and the senator enthusiastically told the crowd: ""The reason you love him so much is because he loves you.

He really does. He genuinely likes being with people. He just thrives on it. They see that and know that, and so that's what I was trying to express.""\Corker acknowledged that Trump makes ""inartful"" comments"" but said the candidate is different than how his detractors perceive him.\""What I would say about Trump is that he's very respectful, very considerate,"" Corker said.

""I feel I have been constructive.""\Tennessee is famous for having a moderating influence on national politics, and Tennesseans have preferred not to send ideologues to the U.S. Senate.\Whether Corker is able to influence the way Trump acts in public remains to be seen; however, the candidate has been relying on the senator's advice for a couple of months.\The last time I spoke to Corker was in May, after the senator had praised Trump's April 27 foreign policy speech and received the first of several calls from the candidate.\He said then: ""I do not consider ourselves an adviser or intimately involved in the campaign.\""When asked about things, we're ready to offer an opinion we think might be helpful.""\Their relationship has obviously grown since that point, and it appears that Corker will be playing an ever more important role as an adviser.\On Wednesday Corker remarked about Trump: ""As time rolls on, as he's thinking about various things, my guess is that he's going to be in contact.""\David Plazas is the opinion engagement editor of The Tennessean.

138,"Tennessee conservative activist Andy Ogles will seek the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee.\Ogles' announcement sets up the long anticipated Republican primary fight for the junior senator's seat.\""Over the past several months it has become increasingly clear that too many of our elected officials in Washington are failing our country, failing to fulfill their promises, and failing our future,"" Ogles, 46, said in a news release.\""Sadly, Republicans who promised to govern as conservatives if we would just 'give them a majority' are letting us down the most, including our Senators from Tennessee.""\On Thursday, Corker told reporters in Washington, D.C. that a decision on whether to run for a third term will be coming very soon.\""I realize that I have a responsibility to the citizens back home and people who may be considering running and those kinds of things, and actually to the people here (in Washington), I need to be clear about what my intentions are,"" he said. ""That will happen very, very soon.""\Ogles, a Franklin native, most recently served as the head of Americans For Prosperity in Tennessee. The Koch-funded organization led the charge to successfully derail expansion of Medicaid in Tennessee, but Ogles lost a very public fight against Gov. Bill Haslam's gas tax increase this year.\Ogles confirmed he has stepped down from the organization.\""We will not change what we are seeing in Washington until we send new, strong conservative representatives to Washington. Our problem isn't the shortage of Republicans in the Senate, it is the shortage of the right Republicans in the Senate,"" Ogles said in the news release.\Ogles launched a website for his campaign Thursday.\His bid for the U.S. Senate will be his third run for public office -- in 2002 he unsuccessfully sought the seat for the 4th Congressional District, losing the Republican primary to now state Sen. Janice Bowling. Ogles also finished last in a six-way race for the state Senate in 2006. He withdrew from the race but not in time to remove his name from the ballot.\In an interview, Ogles said he decided to run for the U.S. Senate seat in part because of President Donald Trump's calls to ""drain the swamp.""\The news comes days after reports that Steve Bannon, former Trump White House advisor, is targeting Corker as a GOP senator who has not supported the president fervently enough.\Once a candidate for Trump's vice president and secretary of state, Corker has since criticized Trump publicly.\In May, Corker said the White House was ""in a downward spiral"" and needed to get under control after news broke that Trump revealed classified information to high-ranking Russian officials.\In August, Trump lashed out in a tweet after Corker said the president hasn't yet demonstrated that he understands the character of the nation and has not shown some of the competence needed to lead.\""Strange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in '18. Tennessee not happy!"" Trump tweeted.\Since then, Corker and U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, have said Corker and Trump have a strong relationship. The president and Corker are set to have an in-person meeting Friday, their first since Trump's tweet.\Ogles declined to say whether either Bannon's comments or Trump's tweet played a role in his decision to run.\Instead, Ogles cited Corker's scorecard by Heritage Action for America, an arm of the Heritage Foundation, to question the senator's conservative credentials. The organization gave Corker a 50 percent rating, below the average for Republican senators.\Corker said Thursday a primary challenger was expected.\""No one should expect that they're going to run in this environment with the frustrations that people share -- that I share -- without having people who are going to be interested in primaries. That's where we are,"" Corker said.\Joey Garrison and Michael Collins contributed to this report."
139,"State Sen. Mae Beavers, R-Mt. Juliet, says she plans to announce her candidacy for governor of Tennessee, making a sudden entry into the race as a fellow tea party-aligned Republican senator continues to mull a bid.\Beavers, in a news statement issued Saturday evening, said over the past several weeks ""it has become increasingly clear that conservatives in Tennessee are looking for bold leadership that will not shrink from standing up and speaking up on the key issues facing our state.""\""President Donald J. Trump is taking the lead in Washington, D.C., to 'drain the swamp' there, but we have our own swamp in Tennessee and I intend to do the same thing in the Volunteer State,"" Beavers said.\Beavers, a staunch conservative, particularly on social issues, rattled off a long list of causes popular with tea party Republicans as her platform, led by the threat she says radial Islam poses on Tennesseans. She called addressing it her top priority.\""The terrorist threat from radical Islam not only impacts other countries or major cities in our own country -- that threat is also targeted at our communities and our families in Tennessee, and I intend to make security a centerpiece of my campaign,"" she said.\The 69-year-old Beavers, who has served in the Senate since 2002 after serving four terms in the House, said she intends to formally announce her campaign in the 2018 gubernatorial Republican primary at an event at Charlie Daniels Park in Mt. Juliet next Saturday.\Beavers, an early Trump supporter last year and former Trump delegate, first expressed an interest in entering the Republican primary for governor in March when it appeared Sen. Mark Green, R-Clarksville -- at the time, a declared candidate for governor -- would be Trump's nominee for U.S. Secretary of the Army. The conventional wisdom was his exit would provide an opening for a candidate like Beavers who could appeal to the far political right of the party.\Trump nominated Green in April, but Green on May 5 withdrew his own nomination amid a fierce backlash from LGBT advocacy groups and others over a trail of past controversial statements. Green is considering re-entering the race for governor and has said he would likely have a decision by Memorial Day, Monday.\Beavers, in her statement Saturday, called on Republicans ""who have been wanting a clear, consistent conservative to lead the way"" to get behind her campaign.\This past session, Beavers carried legislation that sought to legally define marriage as being between one man and one woman -- despite the U.S. Supreme Court's decision saying otherwise. She led the passage of a resolution condemning pornography as a ""public health crisis."" She's also consistently pushed for an elected attorney general in Tennessee.\Beavers, long ridiculed by liberals, faced criticism this year for refusing to meet with protesters who opposed her legislation that took aim at same-sex marriage.\If elected, she pledged to lead a ""full effort"" to repeal Gov. Bill Haslam's recently passed gas tax increase and to set straight the state's spending practices so that ""taxpayers get the biggest bang possible for their tax dollars.""\And in a commitment to what she called ""family values"" issues, the pro-life Beavers cited abortion and restroom policies for transgender people as areas of focus.\""As governor, I will make sure that Tennessee focuses on protecting children before they are born and then providing them a safe and secure environment to grow up in after they are born,"" she said. ""That safety and security extends to making sure that men don't go into the bathrooms and locker rooms of little girls.""\Beavers' decision last week to pull out of a governor's candidate panel at the Rutherford County Republican Party Reagan Day Dinner had led some to speculate she wasn't going to run. But Beavers, who had cited a ""conflict,"" on Friday rejected that talk.\For the moment, Beavers arguably occupies the tea-party lane of the GOP primary largely to herself, but that would change if Green enters. U.S. Rep. Diane Black, R-Tennessee, who is considering a run for governor, draws from a similar Middle Tennessee conservative base as well.\Other Republicans considering running for governor are Tennessee House Speaker Beth Harwell and Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris.\On the Democratic side, former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean is the only announced candidate, but Tennessee House Minority Leader Craig Fitzhugh is expected to enter as well."
140,"Staff Writer\Tennessee may soon get the green light to build more toll roads and bridges than the two pilot projects lawmakers approved last year.\The Tollway Act of 2007 allowed the Tennessee Department of Transportation to choose one new highway project and one bridge project to present to the General Assembly by January.\An amendment passed in the House would remove the limitations. The Senate is scheduled to consider the amendment today.\Even if the broader law passes, motorists should not expect to pay tolls in Tennessee any time soon. Officials say highway tolls are at least five years away.\""This amendment just gives TDOT the right to look at other possible projects, but they have to be brought forth by the community,"" said state Rep. Phillip Pinion, who sponsored the House amendment. ""Right now, we are limited under the law to what we can even consider.""\The proposal comes as the federal government continues to hold back transportation money it promised to the states. Tennessee will lose $66 million for this year.\Several lawmakers and communities have requested studies for possible toll areas, said Julie A. Oaks, spokeswoman for TDOT.\""We need to look at each one and see if they are feasible,"" Oaks said.\""Then we need to conduct public meetings and get input from the people.""\To be considered, a toll project must be proposed on a new route, and alternate routes must be available so that no motorist is forced to pay a toll.\Tim Oliphant, a former Nashville resident who lives in Lewisburg, believes toll roads would create more congestion on highways. Oliphant said he would choose the non-toll alternate routes instead.\""You just don't breeze through them,"" Oliphant said.\""I've traveled toll roads for business, and if there was a lot of traffic, you're talking bumper to bumper the whole time at the toll.""\One Nashville-area project mentioned as a possible toll road is a 6.4-mile highway connecting Gallatin Pike in Hendersonville and Briley Parkway in the Opryland area of Nashville, which would improve access from the Sumner County suburbs to Nashville International Airport. It would cost an estimated $300 million to $400 million.\Public hearings are set for 5 p.m. April 15 at Hendersonville High School in Hendersonville and 5 p.m. April 22 in Dupont Hadley Middle School in Old Hickory.\25 states have tolls\Tennessee is known as a pay-as-you-go state. Unlike most, it doesn't borrow road-construction money by issuing bonds. Instead, the state raises money for its share of highway construction costs through gasoline taxes.\If toll roads come to Tennessee, construction would be financed with bonds that would be repaid with toll revenues. At least 25 states have tolls.\The Federal Highway Administration provides a large share of the money required to build many roads, but budget tightening has reduced funding promised to Tennessee and other states.\TDOT has lost more than $237 million in funding since 2005 and $66 million for this year.\The agency is looking at alternatives to fill the void, and the toll program is one option, said Ed Cole, chief of planning and environment with TDOT.\""The ability of the per-gallon gas tax to fulfill transportation needs is strained,"" Cole said. ""We have to look at every alternate funding mechanisms that we can find. We understand that a toll is not a panacea or a fix-all solution.""\Franklin resident Don Hicks said in an e-mail that tolls and public-private partnerships could help fill some of the funding shortfalls.\He points to Florida as a leader in progressive and creative toll programs.\""It is my opinion that Tennessee is years, if not decades, behind other states in this program,"" Hicks said.\Contact Christina E.

142,"For the second time in 21 months, Gov. Bill Haslam has declined to run for the U.S. Senate, the Knoxville Republican said in an exclusive letter submitted to the USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee.\The former governor's decision, which came after U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander said in December he will not seek reelection in 2020, immediately bolsters the chances of a contested Republican primary.\""While I think serving in the United States Senate would be a great privilege and responsibility, I have come to the conclusion that it is not my calling for the next period of my life,"" Haslam, 60, said in the letter.\""This is a difficult decision because I have loved my time in public service and I believe so deeply in the importance of our political process.""\Haslam's move likely increases the prospects that Bill Hagerty, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, could launch his own bid for the Senate.\When Alexander announced his plans to retire, Alexander mentioned Haslam and Hagerty as the ""most obvious"" candidates. Hagerty, who has attended several political events in Tennessee in recent weeks, previously served as Haslam's commissioner of the state Department of Economic and Community Development.\Other Republicans who could enter the race include U.S. Rep. Mark Green and former U.S. Reps. Diane Black and Stephen Fincher.\Nashville orthopedic trauma surgeon Manny Sethi became the first top-tier Republican to enter the race when he launched his bid in early June.\John Geer, Vanderbilt political science professor, said Haslam's decision recasts the GOP primary.\""I would expect a number of candidates to jump into the race to be our next senator and make it a competitive battle,"" he said.\With Nashville attorney and Iraq War veteran James Mackler the lone Democrat in the race, Geer said Haslam's decision will have little effect on the Republican Party's prospects of losing the seat.\""The (Phil) Bredesen defeat last year underscores the strength the Republican Party has in general election contests,"" Geer said.\In his letter, Haslam said his time as mayor of Knoxville and governor ""changed me forever.""\""I have a much greater appreciation for the impact that effective government can have on citizens of all backgrounds, beliefs, and life circumstances,"" he said. ""Public service is so much more than the political disagreements that too often define our current environment.""\Haslam said weighing a bid for the Senate ""has been the hardest vocational decision of my life.""\""This is a difficult decision because I have loved my time in public service and I believe so deeply in the importance of our political process,"" he wrote.\The former governor gave no indication about his future plans, beyond saying he looked forward to serving Tennessee and the country in other ways.\Since leaving office in January, Haslam has taken several trips out of the country while spending time with his family. He largely managed to avoid public appearances or statements, aside from saying on multiple occasions that he would announce his decision on the race in the coming weeks.\Haslam's decision to stay out of the 2020 election comes after he previously considered running for the upper chamber when U.S. Sen. Bob Corker announced his retirement in September 2017.

147,"
Taxpayers likely wonder just where all their hard-earned tax dollars are going this year.
\
Washington will spend $31,406 per household in 2010 -- the highest level in American history (adjusted for inflation). It will collect $18,276 per household in taxes. The remaining $13,130 represents this year's staggering budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.
\
Government spending has increased by $5,000 per household since 2008, and nearly $10,000 per household over the past decade. Yet there is no free lunch: If spending is not reined in, then eventually taxes must also rise by $10,000 per household.
\
Washington will spend this $31,406 per household as follows:
\
* Social Security and Medicare: $9,949. The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of these costs. This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers. Unless these programs are reformed, paying all promised benefits would eventually require doubling all income tax rates.
\
* Defense: $6,071. The defense budget covers everything from military paychecks to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the research, development and acquisition of new technologies and equipment. Lawmakers drastically reduced military spending after the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The 9/11 attacks reversed this trend, and the inflation-adjusted $2,472-per-household increase since 2000 has returned military spending closer to its historical levels (but still lower than during previous wars).
\
* Anti-poverty programs: $5,466. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. Other low-income spending includes Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, housing subsidies, child-care subsidies, Supplemental Security Income and low-income tax credits. President
\
George W. Bush increased anti-poverty spending to record levels, and it has grown an additional 32 percent since the end of 2008 under President Barack Obama.
\
* Unemployment benefits: $1,640. Unemployment costs have surged by 411 percent during the recession.
\
* Interest on the federal debt: $1,585. The federal government is $13 trillion in debt. It owes $9 trillion to public bond owners, and the rest to other federal agencies (mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund, which lawmakers raided annually before the program went into deficit in 2010). Record-low interest rates have recently held down these costs. However, the national debt is set to double by 2020, which will combine with higher interest rates to raise annual interest costs to nearly $6,000 per household.
\
* Veterans' benefits: $1,052. The federal government provides income and health benefits to war veterans. Spending is up 83 percent since 2000.
\
* Federal employee retirement benefits: $1,018. This spending funds the retirement and disability benefits of federal employees, including the military.
\
* Education: $914. Education spending is primarily a state and local function; 9 percent of the total comes from Washington. The federal education budget has leaped 125 percent since 2000. Most federal dollars are spent on low-income school districts, special education and college student financial aid.
\
* Highways and mass transit: $613. Most highway and mass-transit spending is financed by the 18.4-cent-per-gallon federal gas tax. Washington subtracts an administrative cost and sends this money back to the states with numerous strings attached.
\
* Health research and regulation: $550. This spending is up 50 percent since 2001, and much of this growth is concentrated in the National Institutes of Health. The category also includes the Food and Drug Administration and dozens of grant programs for health providers.
\
* Mortgage credit: $470. While most of the bank bailouts occurred last year, the bailouts of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the rest of the housing market continue.
\
The programs listed above cover $29,328 per household. The remaining $2,078 is allocated to all other federal programs, including justice, international affairs, natural resources, the environment, regional development, farm subsidies, social services, space exploration, air transportation and energy.
\
Taxpayers -- and the next generation that will be paying nearly half of the bill -- must decide for themselves if they're getting their money's worth.

""Public service is so much more than the political disagreements that too often define our current environment.""\Haslam said weighing a bid for the Senate ""has been the hardest vocational decision of my life.""\""This is a difficult decision because I have loved my time in public service and I believe so deeply in the importance of our political process,"" he wrote.\The former governor gave no indication about his future plans, beyond saying he looked forward to serving Tennessee and the country in other ways.\Since leaving office in January, Haslam has taken several trips out of the country while spending time with his family. He largely managed to avoid public appearances or statements, aside from saying on multiple occasions that he would announce his decision on the race in the coming weeks.\Haslam's decision to stay out of the 2020 election comes after he previously considered running for the upper chamber when U.S. Sen. Bob Corker announced his retirement in September 2017. But he opted against a bid, citing a desire to remain focused on his final months as governor.\With ties to national Republicans, including Vice President Mike Pence and campaign strategist Ward Baker, Haslam would have had a significant leg up on most other Tennessee Republicans and jumped to frontrunner status.\Baker was the chief strategist for U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn in her victory over Bredesen.\For years, Haslam has remained the most popular politician in Tennessee, despite having some controversial positions and views, including raising the state's gas tax, pushing Medicaid expansion and criticizing President Donald Trump. Such issues would have given a more tea party aligned Republican an opportunity to challenge Haslam in a primary.\But given Haslam's name recognition, immense personal wealth — he's one of the richest politicians in the country, behind Trump — and an ability to raise money from national and state Republicans, any challenger would have faced a massive uphill battle for the party's nomination.\Instead, Haslam's departure makes it increasingly likely that other Republicans will enter the Senate race, which has 15 months remaining until the general election.\Reach Joel Ebert at jebert@tennessean.com or 615-772-1681 and on Twitter @joelebert29.\INSIDE: Exclusive op-ed: Former Gov.

151,"Beavers tries to blunt comeback try by Rochelle\By JESSICA FENDER\Staff Writer\On one hand, a masked cartoon of a cape-wearing super-villain -- dubbed the ""Prince of Darkness"" -- flies through the air, advocating tax hikes and squelching ethics reforms.\On the other hand, a pig-tailed tot throws a tantrum when she doesn't get her way.\With less than two weeks until the Nov. 7 election, the claws are out in the state Senate race in the counties just east of Nashville -- and both sides are going for the jugular, though some constituents say they would rather hear about issues than attacks.\The two candidates are the incumbent, Republican state Sen. Mae Beavers, and former Democratic state Sen. Majority Leader Bob Rochelle.\The contest for the seven-county District 17, which includes Wilson and Macon counties, is one of three that probably will decide which party controls the state Senate. Those stakes have amped up the intensity, according to Mark Brown, spokesman for the state Democratic Party.\""It's partly a function of the media market -- there are four TV stations in Nashville -- and these are two people who've been around politics,"" Brown said. ""All of that kind of comes together to create a pretty tough environment. It has been spirited, I'll be diplomatic.""\The GOP holds an 18-14 lead in the state Senate, wielding a numerical majority that has not been united enough to oust Democrat John Wilder as lieutenant governor.\The ""silly"" ads in the race frustrate Lebanon surgeon Douglas Freels, who wants to hear the candidates' views on issues near to his heart and pocketbook, such as medical malpractice insurance reform, he said.\""The real issues aren't being addressed ... just stupid stuff that doesn't make any difference,"" Freels said. Tort reform ""is something that can make a difference to the public.""\Beavers and Rochelle faced off Wednesday night, the first hope Freels had for any substantive discussion, he said.\Four years ago, Rochelle left his Senate post after leading a charge to implement a state income tax that failed. Beavers' campaign continues to hammer Rochelle on that issue.\Rochelle, meanwhile, says he brought millions of dollars to Tennessee for jobs, education and health care. He accuses Beavers of being ""immature, ineffective and wrong for us"" in his ads.\Neither side considers its campaigns negative, spokeswomen for the two sides say.\""I don't know that I would call it mudslinging. It's Bob's duty to talk about where his opponent stands,"" said Anastasia Apa, spokeswoman for Rochelle's campaign, sponsor of the tantrum commercial.\Another anti-Beavers ad discusses a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation probe into allegations that then-state Rep. Beavers did not live in her district. Though the TBI found no basis to prosecute Beavers, the commercial seems to cast her as a criminal, using flashing police lights, police tape and suggesting she lied.\""While some might find the ad to be dramatical, it's all real. It's a reality ad,"" Apa said.\None of the negative nicknames for Rochelle has come from the Beavers camp, spokeswoman and campaign manager Marti Fouce said.\"" 'State Reptile,' that was placed on him by the other senators,"" Fouce said. She added that it was radio talk show host Dave Ramsey who gave Rochelle the ""Boss Hogg"" moniker in a radio ad now featured on Beavers' campaign Web site.\A Washington, D.C.-based organization called the Republican State Leadership Committee furnished the cash for the ""Prince of Darkness"" spot. The title, a nickname given to him by some on Capitol Hill during his tenure as a Senate powerbroker, was mentioned in a Memphis newspaper column dated April 30, 1993. In the column, Rochelle said he didn't mind the name.\The state Democratic Party has called on Beavers to denounce the ad and asked for it to be pulled because of the group's questionable background. The committee has been reprimanded in other states for refusing to properly record campaign contributions, according to media reports in those states.\Marti Fouce called the ad ""a little heavy ... but it's funny and it's true."" o\Contact Jessica Fender at jfender@tennessean.com or 259-8094.\BREAKING DOWN THE ADS\A look at the campaign ads in the state Senate race between Sen. Mae Beavers and former state Senate Majority Leader Bob Rochelle is a pretty hot one, with each side's campaign ads striking at their opponents.\THE ISSUE\In one TV ad, the Rochelle campaign talks about a TBI probe into whether Beavers lived in the district she represented in the state House.\He says: Beavers lived outside her district. She refused to testify and invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. ""If you have nothing to hide, you should have no problem"" testifying, said Anastasia Apa, Rochelle spokeswoman.\She says: The matter never went to court, so she was never asked to testify. She did not invoke her Fifth Amendment right. She was living in an investment house she was trying to sell at the time.\Records say: While there was proof that Beavers lived outside her district for a year, there was no evidence that she did not plan to return to the apartment complex in her district, and state law says a legislator can reside wherever she likes as long as she intends to return to her home district -- it's the same issue as the one that arose concerning state Sen. John Ford and allegations that he lived in three houses. Beavers ""declined to be interviewed and to give a statement"" to TBI investigators, according to a letter dated Oct. 18, 2002, from Jerry Estes, an Eaststate prosecutor who handled the case.\THE ISSUE\Beavers criticizes the state income tax Rochelle backed in 2001 and 2002.\She says: Rochelle is ""the godfather of the state income tax,"" she says on her Web site.\He says: ""I was wrong on the income tax ... it's a dead issue,"" he says in another TV ad. He signed a pledge promising not to support an income tax without the vote of the people.\Records say: It was widely reported at the time, including in The Tennessean, that Rochelle led the fight for the state income tax, which would have raised $569 million in the first year by levying a 2 percent to 8 percent tax on individuals making $15,001 a year and up.\THE ISSUE\Another ad blasts Beavers' record on the minimum wage.\He says: She voted against a 2006 bill to boost the minimum wage to $6.15 an hour.\She says: She never voted against the minimum wage bill because it never came to a vote.\Records say: The minimum wage bill never came up for a vote because it was sent back to a committee in the waning days of the legislative session. Beavers was one of 17 Republicans who voted to send the minimum wage bill to that committee.\THE ISSUE\The Republican State Leadership Committee produced an ad that mentions Rochelle in the same breath as the recent bribery arrests in the state legislature. The ad also accuses Rochelle of raising gas taxes four times.\She says: While the Beavers campaign didn't sponsor the ad, they say it's funny and it's true.\He says: Rochelle had nothing to do with the bribery allegations. He wasn't in office. He voted to raise gas taxes because those dollars were needed to repair the state's struggling road system.\Records say: The Operation Tennessee Waltz bribery arrests were made in May 2005. Rochelle left the state legislature in 2002. Newspaper clippings from Lebanon and copies of the old bills show Rochelle supported four gas tax increases.\-- JESSICA FENDER"
152,"Just as Tennessee is set to have a new governor, the state House of Representatives will also see its first new leader in eight years.\On Tuesday, House Republicans will decide who they want to represent them in key leadership posts, including the chamber's speaker and majority leader. While the GOP caucus will elect who they want to lead the legislature when it reconvenes in January, the leadership votes will also help determine which direction the state should head as it embarks on a new era.\House Republicans will have a choice of three candidates for the chamber's speaker: Glen Casada, R-Franklin; Curtis Johnson, R-Clarksville; and David Hawk, R-Greeneville.\All three men are vying for the position that House Speaker Beth Harwell, who did not seek re-election this year when she unsuccessfully ran for governor, has had since 2011.\The speaker wields considerable power and can help drive, alter or derail the agenda and goals of Gov.-elect Bill Lee's administration.\Casada, who has served in various leadership roles for the last 12 years, including most recently as the chamber's majority leader, is largely seen as the favorite. He helped get several incoming freshmen lawmakers elected and has deep pockets to contribute money to his colleagues. Casada would likely look to play a more influential role than some say Harwell did and even stand up to Senate lawmakers on occasion.\Johnson has served as speaker pro tempore, a largely ceremonial position, since 2012. He is viewed as someone that would continue to the lead the House in a similar way as Harwell.\Hawk, who most recently served as assistant Republican leader, is best known for proposing an unsuccessful alternative plan to Gov. Bill Haslam's gas tax increase in 2017.\By Hawk's estimate, as of this week, it's still up in the air who in the race has the most vote commitments.\""I don't think that any of the three have a majority of votes right now,"" Hawk said.\But Casada and Johnson both said they're confident they have the votes needed to become the next speaker.\While each candidate's strategy in pitching themselves to colleagues has differed, the three Republicans have spent recent months working the phones, visiting other lawmakers and, in Hawk's case, handwriting letters asking for their vote.\""My colleagues are tired of phone calls,"" Hawk said. ""Because not only do you have folks running for speaker, you have folks running for every leadership position.""\Describing himself as ""old fashioned,"" Hawk said he has, over the course of three months, hand-written three notes to each of his legislative colleagues — in addition to making calls.\Over nearly the same time period, Casada has traveled the state, spending five or six days a week taking out other lawmakers — and their spouses — to a meal. He lets the spouse pick the restaurant.\He also has 12 ""team captains,"" or other legislators, making calls on his behalf. Casada declined to identify his captains.\Just two lawmakers during those meals have told Casada they had already decided and were backing one of the other candidates, he said.\While Casada declined to elaborate on his estimates, he said he felt ""very, very comfortable"" with the vote count and has confirmed responses from his direct asks with information his surrogates have gathered.\After making phone calls and in-person visits around the state, Johnson said he feels ""real good about"" his vote count.\""I'd like to say I have 100 percent of the vote, but in reality, that's not going to happen,"" Johnson said.\While Casada said he believed there were ""a few natural fits,"" he said he had not made any promises on committee appointments. Johnson and Hawk both adamantly denied making any promises in the vote-courting process.\Johnson said he has pitched his commitment to working with all members ""to make sure we have a united caucus"" throughout the transition into a new administration.\""I've been speaker pro tem for the last six years,"" Johnson said. ""I've worked very close with the speaker. This is just the natural next step.""\Casada said he has discussed with members the importance of the House ""taking strong positions in the arena of public policy"" and playing a major role in the budget process. He is also reminding colleagues of what he has done for them in the past.\""I've spent years helping members in their fundraising, helping them campaign, helping with their bills in committee, and then been a voice in the caucus on the shared conservative values we have,"" Casada said.\Hawk, who described himself as a ""peacemaker,"" said he would be a speaker who is able to mediate between lawmakers with opposing views on policies, including within the party.\""Someone in leadership needs to create the environment where we can all sit down, express our differences and then come together on the areas in which we agree,"" Hawk said.\All three candidates will be voted on by the chamber's 73 Republicans. The top-two vote-getters will advance to a head-to-head match up that will decide the party's nominee for speaker, unless one candidate gets 37 votes in the first round. Votes will be cast in a secret ballot.\Another leadership post Republicans will vote on will be the chamber's majority leader. The position has historically carried legislation being pushed by the governor's office and, like the speaker, can impact the fate of legislative proposals.\Three lawmakers — Reps. Ryan Williams, R-Cookeville; William Lamberth, R-Cottontown; and Jerry Sexton, R-Bean Station — have announced their bids for the spot.\During the 110th General Assembly, Williams served as the House Republican Caucus Chairman and Lamberth was chairman of the House Criminal Justice Committee. Sexton did not serve as the head of any committees or subcommittees during the 110th General Assembly.\Beyond the top two posts, House Republicans will also select who they want to serve in several other leadership positions. The following lawmakers have declared their intentions to run for various leadership roles.\Republican Caucus Chairman: Reps.

All members of the House and Senate must vote on the main leadership posts when the 111th General Assembly convenes in January.\Republicans maintain super majorities in both chambers, making the results of their leadership elections the likely outcome when the entire legislature votes on the positions.\Reach Joel Ebert at jebert@tennessean.com or 615-772-1681 and on Twitter @joelebert29.

155,"The Kathleen Parker article, ""Washington would cringe at dumbed-down country,"" Feb. 19, stressing the lack of history in schools is well-founded.\Both the federal government and the education community have shown a lack of commitment to the teaching of history in schools serving our nation. An extreme emphasis has been placed on mathematics, science and foreign language by the federal government and the nation's educators. The failure to emphasize the teaching of history has already had an adverse impact on our society as evidenced in the article.\History is a vital component used to enhance our nation. A failure to properly prioritize national historical teachings in schools eliminates a chance for citizens to learn specific historical accomplishments achieved during our nation's growth. It further removes from our citizens the unique national identity developed during the history of the United States. As a licensed history teacher, I have personally experienced the lack of emphasis given to history by the government.\The failure to recognize the importance of teaching history will continually undermine the understanding of our nation's historical foundation, eliminate the ability of the citizens to comprehend the strengths of our country and promote a lack of protection of our national values and freedoms.\The government must reevaluate the importance of emphasizing the teaching of our national history in school environments.\Such a re-evaluation will result in the designation of history as a priority subject to be taught to the citizens of the United States and strengthen our national pride.\James Stanley\Nashville 37214\Resolutions support troops, not Bush\To the Editor:\In deference to the letter by Grayson Robertson (""Congress' non-binding resolutions meaningless, Feb. 18), the House and Senate resolutions about the president's Iraq war escalation plans are not meaningless to the vast majority of American citizens.\The resolutions clearly support our troops and are clearly targeted to not support President Bush's continued expansion of our military presence in Iraq at the cost of more lives and precious resources.\Granted that the resolutions may be meaningless to Bush, but then so has legislation against torture to which he writes his own ""exceptions."" These resolutions are a continued reflection of the voters who have expressed their displeasure with the president's war policies and actions.\Rather than giving comfort to the insurgents in Iraq, these actions by the voters and Congress show the world that we can support our soldiers in the field, but have the freedom to denounce our lame duck president.\It is a freedom that is not unpatriotic, but is necessary to keep our nation strong.\Michael Bolduc\Franklin 37064\Media fascinated with John F.

I am so weary of being bombarded with ""newly discovered"" pictures and other information about it.\He was not the greatest president, although some people seem to think so. The news media seem to be endlessly fascinated by the man.\Evelyn Campbell\Nashville 37211\Cold, snow prove global warming\To the Editor:\In response to letter writer Rich Rosenberry (""Snow, cold prove global warming isn't happening,"" Feb. 19) and everyone else who insists global warming is not happening because of cold temperatures and snow, the reason the upper Midwest and Northeast are getting pummeled with snow is because normally at this time of year, the Great Lakes are partially frozen over.\Because of unusually warm temperatures earlier in the season, the lakes have not frozen and extra moisture is evaporating, causing the extreme amounts of snow.\Global warming causes unusual shifts in air currents, resulting in cold temperatures in normally warm areas and warm temperatures in normally cold areas. The question isn't whether global warming is happening - it has been proven that the Earth is several degrees warmer - but whether the warming is a natural climate change or caused by man.\Many scientists believe we are in a somewhat natural climate change that is being accelerated by the greenhouse gasses that humans are dumping into the atmosphere.\As far as a ""cure"" for global warming, we probably cannot stop the changes that are occurring, but that is no excuse to continue polluting our planet the way we have been.\Stephanie North\Pegram 37143\Polluted streams foul our drinking water\To the Editor:\The Tennessean's coverage of the chemical spill into a Franklin creek seemed thorough (""Company official says paint plant 'probably' cause of chemical spill,"" Feb. 17). The reported fix, ""company paid for"" left somewhat to the imagination. Hauling away polluted soil to a landfill is typically carried out.\No mention was made of repairs to the stream water itself. The report of the company's good behavior was thus insufficiently covered or the area treatment was incomplete. A single drop of an organic chemical present therein could pollute hundreds of gallons of water.\We eventually drink from those streams. This points up the fact that there is no ""away"" to which we can throw bad stuff. It comes right back in our face.\I have personally removed a gallon of used motor oil and automobile wheels from Old Hickory Lake. Polluters should have to pay high penalties for their action - accidental or contrived.\We all lose healthy environmental quality through poor behavior.\James Wells\Hendersonville 37075\Symphony reviews appreciated by fans\To the Editor:\The Tennessean is to be complimented on once again publishing reviews of the Nashville Symphony. These not only let the area readers know that Music City has a vibrant orchestra but lets the nation know that we have a variety of musical offerings.\Jonathan Neufeld presents a scholarly review that any newspaper would be proud to publish (""'Haydn to Glass' program fits together richly,"" Feb 17).\James Miller\Lebanon 37087\A good choice for Bush's library site\To the Editor:\Because today's corporate media now defines ""breaking news"" as tabloid-level fascination around the unfortunate demise of controversy-seekers like Anna Nicole Smith, whose death sadly mimicked her life, more weighty and worthy social controversies are pushed to the thin margins of obscurity.\One such controversy that's getting scant attention is the proposed site of the George W. Bush presidential library at Southern Methodist University.\What makes this proposal so outrageous is the presumption that a Methodist institution of higher learning would seek, or let alone deserve, to align its theological heritage with the ideological legacy of a president who turned a willful and calloused deaf ear to our bishops who tried, with no success, to advise him against this now-failed war in Iraq.\For the last 30 years, presidential libraries have evolved from mere museums to that of powerful policy-generating centers endowed by influential elites who intend, at whatever cost, to validate and further political philosophies that often run roughshod over the very academic and religious cultures that stood, and still stand, in opposition to their agendas.\Duke University held its ground and refused to allow the Richard Nixon library to take residence there, and so did Stanford University say ""thanks, but no thanks"" when the Ronald Reagan library search committee chose it as its most favored site.\Given the theological extremism that has misguided our current president, it only seems fitting that the next presidential library be built at Bob Jones University.\Mark Forrester\Nashville 37216\Build sanctuaries for threatened species\To the Editor:\I remember that Franklin Roosevelt, my hero, had a ""good neighbor"" policy for South America - not a bad idea in today's world. Would that we could develop a somewhat similar policy today with one or more of the South American countries along the following lines.\I read the front-page story of The Tennessean on Feb. 19 about the elephants thriving at the sanctuary at Hohenwald and the thought struck me that as things now stand, it may be that in the not-too-distant future, these magnificent animals, along with others in Africa, may well become extinct. The shrinking of the habitat for the larger animals such as the lion, tiger, hippopotamus, rhinoceros and the like conceivably threatens their very existence over time.\If the United States could focus on something in addition to wars in distant lands and develop and sponsor a plan with South American countries to introduce into parks many of the threatened species that will conceivably die out, then future generations of the human race can enjoy seeing and knowing these splendid creations of our heavenly father.\The climate there certainly is conducive to their well-being. Perhaps this, in a small way, could help promote tourism in South America, as well as help develop better relations with our ""good neighbors"" to the south of us.\Bob Carpenter\Hendersonville 37075\Grammy snub of country music unforgivable\To the Editor:\Kudos to Joe Galante, Mike Dungan, T.K. Kimbrell and Randy Goodman for speaking out on behalf of country music at the latest snub by the Grammy organization (""Music Row says Grammys snubbed country, like always,"" Feb. 18).\While the Grammy organization wants country artists to perform in order to make their TV show more attractive to the public and advertisers, the disrespect of the genre is unforgivable.\The arrogance of Neil Portnow, president of The Recording Academy, is comical. Taking a quote from Joe Galante: ""I'm done with the Grammys.""\S. Ralph Gordon\Nashville 37215\Every human has unique, valuable experiences\To the Editor:\Those who have never milked can't appreciate the feeling of happiness on a cold, cold morning when it's not required. The warmth of those Jerseys compensated when the temps were especially low.\But then there was the shock of getting out of the warm bed and stepping onto the cold floor. And the mud balls on the cows' tails surely hurt when they swung them your way. It's a shame more can't appreciate what we have today and also note what we've left behind. We can certainly better know the joys of warmth when we have known the cold.\It is difficult to empathize with those whose backgrounds are foreign to us. Just as my great-nephews can't know the mixed blessings of the milk barn, I don't think any of us can adequately understand what the others among us may have experienced. I do think that we could all cut each other some slack.\Realizing that we don't have similar backgrounds, let's see what others have to contribute. And, most of all, let's be slower to downplay the joy some may feel in not having to milk on a cold day!\Steve Cates\Murfreesboro 37130\Wasted reconstruction funds point to Bush\To the Editor:\There was recently an article disclosing that the U.S. government has squandered $10 billion of our tax dollars in Iraq reconstruction. Federal auditors have warned that more waste reports are yet to come. The report reveals that more than one in six dollars charged by U.S. contractors is questionable in context and, indeed, the waste triples the amount the Government Accountability Office estimated last fall.\I would assume the total responsibility of this blatant waste and outright thievery of U.S. tax funds reflects back to the leadership of the present administration; primarily, President Bush, in that he is the great ""decider"" by his own admission. Perhaps he can ""decide"" who to charge and send to the federal penitentiary for this grand larceny of our tax dollars.\However, as gloomy as this scenario may appear, there is hope. The capable and efficient IRS is taking the lead in aggressively assuring that any American taxpayers who are cheating on their returns will face swift justice. I base this assertion on the recent disclosure that Americans cheating the government by overstating their church donations must now provide a receipt to substantiate their deductions.\Hopefully, the monies collected by the IRS from these questionable church donations will offset the $10 billion stolen by the U.S. contractors in Iraq. Higher mathematics not being my strong suit, I cannot fathom how many falsely claimed $20 church donations it will take to recoup $10 billion, but hey, it's a start.\Charles David Sliger\Shelbyville 37160\Lack of discipline at home shows up at school\To the Editor:\Public school systems and teachers have been criticized ad infinitum. Politicians at every level promise scholastic nirvana in exchange for increased taxation. President Bush's answer is No Child Left Behind, putting the burden of performance on teachers. So far, there is evidence NCLB is working, and there is evidence it isn't. Something is always working, somewhere.\Years ago, I served as mentor for a young boy who was ""at risk"" due to truancy. During his fourth- grade year, he was absent more than 35 days, an entire grading period. I helped arrange for a tutor, but he did not show up for appointments, even down the street from his house.\His father was absent, his mother was suspected of selling his Ritalin on the street. His own goal was to play in the NBA. He could dribble between his legs, but was barely able to read.\His school counselor told me he had ""fallen through the cracks,"" he needed help, but since his behavior was not criminal, others got the attention. Finally, his mother was taken to court and threatened if his truancy continued. Nothing changed.\The root of the problem is the lack of personal parental responsibility. His parents did not even begin to do their jobs. The parents of the delinquents he sought to emulate did not do theirs. No discipline in the classroom reflects no discipline in the home.\That is the problem, and teachers cannot solve it in 180 days out of 365.\Bob Fajardo\Nashville 37211\Will Gore's concerts benefit continents?\To the Editor:\With regard to the article Feb. 16, ""World concerts to raise concern about climate change, Gore says:"" I was very surprised to read that concerts will be done on all seven continents per the article.\I had an opportunity to spend 15 days on Antarctica in November of 2006 with the National Geographic and learned how strict all countries are about keeping the continent pristine. I had to wash my boots before and after going on to land in order to make sure nothing was transferred from one location to another.\Dogsleds haven't been allowed on the continent since 1996. I became aware of the Antarctic Treaty which was signed over 40 years ago by all of the world's prominent countries, who work together to keep this one place in the world unspoiled for future generations.\There are research stations run by various countries, but no cities. In what ""city"" on Antarctica is Gore planning to stage a concert and has he asked the rest of the world if this will be a positive for the land?\Joyce Fournier\Brentwood 37027\Governor's plan for gas tax unbelievable\To the Editor:\It's hard to believe that Tennessee voters would elect a governor or legislature who would consider increasing the gasoline tax for highway funding in lieu of just following the federal rules governing disbursement of funds for highways.

156,"Health care costs top District 78 concerns\By REGAN LOYOLA CONNOLLY\The Leaf-Chronicle\Health care costs and taxes are just a few of the issues the candidates for state House District 78 say they are discussing with voters in the weeks leading up to the election.\Kingston Springs Mayor Tony Campbell is seeking to unseat Phillip Johnson, who has represented the district since 2002.\District 78, which was created by redistricting in 2002, includes parts of western and southern Montgomery County, the northern section of Williamson County and all of Cheatham County.\Here's how they weigh in on some of the leading topics:\Question: The state, in recent years, has had issues regarding its budget as more people require more services. But revenues may not always keep up with demand. How do you view the current budget picture, and if necessary, what would you propose to help the state resolve its budget issues?\Campbell: ""First and foremost, Governor (Phil) Bredesen said he is not going to propose an income tax. The sales tax increase put in place seems to be covering things, and the rainy-day fund seems to be recovering. There is a study committee that is looking at the Tennessee tax structure, and we need to see what kinds of proposals they have. I am like any one else - I don't like to pay taxes. I think once this study is done, we need to go to the public and say here is what the situation is, here is the revenue and here is the cost. The public needs to be convinced that state government is as lean and as mean as it can be, and then we need to be discussions with the public about what alternatives are out there to discuss funding services. The public needs to make a decision if they want new taxes.""\Johnson: ""Well, I think over the past two years we have shown better management of the money we do have. We have gone from a deficit to over a $300 million surplus. I don't think revenue issues are a problem, it's the out-of- control spending and TennCare that was draining our resources, and I think we are moving in a better direction already.""\Question: Are you in favor of consolidation of Montgomery County and Clarksville governments? Why or why not?""\Campbell: ""From my standpoint in District 78, I don't favor consolidation because I would be willing to bet that 98 percent of people in the district don't want to be part of Clarksville. The local people need to make that decision.\Johnson: ""A large portion of my district that is in Montgomery County is mostly rural. Most people do not favor consolidation. I want to make sure my people have full representation and are not overpowered by city residents.""\Question: Locally, education funding has been a problem. The local school system has made substantial cuts to its budget requests. Additionally, the school system has state BEP (Basic Education Program) guidelines and federal No Child Left Behind mandates it must follow. What would you propose to be done at the state level to assist schools financially and how would you pay for it, if required?""\Campbell: ""I think there is no doubt that education is the most important thing we have going on out there. Our ability to attract good jobs to Tennessee has to do with having good workers for those jobs. Governor Bredesen is trying to increase state support for schools, but an awful lot in the future has to do with getting Tenn-Care under control. We need to start investing in the schools.""\Johnson: ""I think what we're talking about doing is relooking at the Basic Education Program formula in general. When the BEP was originally brought forth at the time, it probably had good basis for working. But now things have changed, and our demands our different and the BEP is not flexible enough. I want to look at the BEP and rework it and be more fair to meet each county's needs. There is a lot to educational funding that goes beyond the state. There is a federal portion and federal dollars have increased nationally 70 percent. Last year, Tennessee sent back almost $4 million in federal funding and in my discussion with the state board of education, I asked why are we sending money back that has been appropriated for Tennessee. They said it was because of a lack of communication. I don't think it is acceptable to send back money when there are counties that are struggling to fund education. We need to foster better relationships between state and federal officials.\Question: Austin Peay State University has had annual tuition increases for the past several years to keep up with its growth and services provided, which is making a college education unaffordable for many, according to officials. What would you propose to be done at the state level to alleviate the growing tuition burden on students and their families?\Campbell: ""I think that the lottery scholarships are going to make college more affordable for more Tennessee students. Tennessee tuition is relatively reasonable, but we have to expect it to increase. The Legislature needs to make sure the colleges and universities are efficient and effective and - at some point - look at further investment for capital needs.""\Johnson: ""I think the lottery program is a step in the right direction to offer assistance. We need to keep a close eye on the education system and make sure they are running as efficiently as possible. It is going to take a combination of the lottery system helping out and making sure we take advantage of all the federal funds available and stay on top of higher education officials. It has to be a joint effort of several parties.""\Question: There are several long-term road projects in our area that seem to have had little progress made on them over the past few years. Do you have a plan to fast-track these projects?\Campbell: ""I would work closely with the Department of Transportation in helping them determine what the priorities are. Across the 78th district, there are transportation needs. One of the things I am hoping is as the states' rainy day fund is built back to an appropriate level, some of gas tax can be returned to the Department of Transportation for accelerating the upgrading of roads. Governor Bredesen diverted some of that money and I would like to see that money returned to the Department of Transportation. In the district, State Route 79 has been on the drawing board for many years and is supposed to more forward shortly.""\Johnson: ""I would love to have work completed as soon as possible but as a state representative, there is not a date I can place on that. It is important we continue to stay on top of projects and we work on local officials and TDOT to make sure we keep things communicating and flowing together. We seem to have a communication breakdown and we need to work more efficient together and keep things moving along.""\Question: Industrial recruitment and higher-paying jobs are important to Montgomery County. One issue, often addressed by the Economic Development Council, is that Tennessee often loses out on jobs because we don't offer the same types of incentives to companies that surrounding states do. What would you do to help ensure more industrial recruitment and higher-paying jobs and how?\Campbell: ""I certainly would want to help Montgomery County officials work to determine what steps it is going to take to develop industry, but we don't need huge tax breaks to get industry here.""\Johnson: ""We are working on a better game plan than what we have had in the past. We don't need to offer incentives, and we need to be a very business-friendly state with lower taxes. We are addressing the issue of workers' compensation, which put us behind other states. We need to make Tennessee more friendly as a site for industrial companies. It's not just the incentives, it's the entire business environment we offer for companies that come here.""\Question: As you go out campaigning, what additional issues are you hearing from constituents in your district?\Campbell: ""I think the number one issue I hear about is health care and prescription drug costs. The high cost of prescription drugs is number one. There are people who are having to make choices between food and drugs. I think there is a lot of concern, I am finding about the cost of health insurance and those who have it through an employer are finding their portion continue to increase at an alarming rate. In Tennessee, 700,000 people don't have health insurance, and we all end up paying for that.""\Johnson: ""Amazingly, the state income tax is still a hot-button issue. I was against it when I ran the first time, and I am still against it. Health care costs are also a concern. I am going to do everything I can to work with Governor Bredesen on health care reform to keep those costs down. We're going to be looking at all kinds of possibilities to keep drug costs down for Tennesseans.""\Regan Loyola Connolly covers courts and county government and can be reached by telephone at 245-0719 or by e-mail at regan connolly@theleafchronicle.com.\ON THE NET\- For profiles of both candidates, along with an archive of local election stories, go to the Election section of www.theleaf chronicle.com.\TONY CAMPBELL\- Age: 65\- Occu-pation: Executive director of the National Ecological Foundation.\- Education: Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural science from the New Mexico State University.\- Civic Organizations: Board of Trustees for Leadership Cheatham County and executive director for the Tennessee Conservation League.\- Key Experience: 16 years as mayor of Kingston Springs and served in the U.S. Air Force from 1958-1962.\PHILLIP JOHNSON\- Age: 43\- Occupation: Self-employed home inspector.\- Education: Degree in business administration from the University of Arkansas.\- Civic Organizations: Member of the Cheatham County Chamber of Commerce and Leadership Cheatham County.\- Key Experience: Served in state House of Representatives for the last two years and previously served on the Pegram Board of Zoning Appeals.\Mugs: Campbell and Johnson"
157,"By SAM STOCKARD STOCKARD@DNJ.COM\-- Sam Stockard 615-278-5165\State Rep. Kent Coleman is entering his fourth term serving the 49th District of the state House of Representatives.\The Murfreesboro Democrat, who was reappointed Thursday as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, sat down with The Daily News Journal to talk about early events in the session and what could happen when it gathers again in February.\Q: What was your first reaction when all 49 Democrats decided to support Republican Kent Williams as the House speaker?\Coleman: My first understanding that it was a possibility took place in the caucus meeting, which was scheduled for 11 o'clock on Tuesday morning. At that time, we were informed that the existing speaker could not get the votes necessary to elect a speaker, and somebody submitted the proposal that Kent Williams would vote for himself if he were going to get elected as speaker, and the only way he could get elected as speaker, in our mind, was for all the Democrats to vote for him. But at the time we first left our caucus meeting to go onto the floor, it was my impression that Kent Williams did not have the necessary votes to get elected speaker. Not until we recessed after the House members were sworn into office did we receive the commitments from some Democrats that might have in the past pledged their support to Jason Mumpower.\Q: From what I understand, Williams had made some commitments to the Republican Party to vote for their caucus nominee. Do you believe he misled Republicans?\Coleman: I really don't have any idea. I do know both parties do the best job they can to try to get their caucus members to vote for their caucus nominees. But knowing the history of Kent Williams getting elected to office and knowing that he didn't seem to have the state Republican Party's support behind him, it was not surprising that he showed some independence in his vote for the speakership.\Q: Do you feel this casts Democrats in a bad light by throwing all their support behind a Republican to kind of steal that House speaker's post away from the Republicans?\Coleman: No, I think the duty of the Democrats was to do what the Democrats felt was in the best interests of Tennesseans, and we had no ability to elect a speaker from the Democratic caucus.\Q: Now Jason Mumpower is alleging that Kent Williams sexually harassed two women, including one state rep. Do you think that's going to affect the House speaker's ability to get the job done this session?\Coleman: I think what it shows, considering that the allegation took place about two years ago, in that it was brought up (Tuesday), that there are very hard feelings internally right now between different factions of the Republican delegation in Nashville.\Q: MTSU is being asked to cut $12 million to $19 million for the coming fiscal year. Is there any way to cut any other department so higher education won't have to make such drastic reductions?\Coleman: If you look at Tennessee's budget, the total budget might be somewhere in the area of $27.7 billion. But a good portion of that money comes from the federal government and it has strings attached to it. You have to use it for the Medicaid program, so you've only got $13 billion you can spend that is state money, and of that $13 billion, a lot of that is directed. If it's from the gas tax, it has to go for roads, so you don't have a lot of discretionary money when you study the state budget. Forty-two percent of our dollars go to education, 28 percent goes for health care, 10 percent goes for law enforcement and jails, 7 percent goes for transportation, 7 percent goes back to the cities and counties on state-shared revenues, so that doesn't leave much money, about 6 percent of your budget to take care of parks, libraries, environment, conservation.\And where MTSU really gets hit the hardest, there aren't really any matching funds that come to the state for us making any expenditure to higher education. It's a discretionary expenditure, so when you have a budget in an economy as depressed as our economy is, and there are no revenues coming in to take care of your appropriations, higher education is one of the likely areas that can get hit. As far as finding other areas where we spend money in the state and could we take that and give it to higher education, I would like to, but I don't think it's really there to shift ... So, I think we need to look at revenue sources for MTSU and the whole Board of Regents and the UT system.\Q: When you talk about revenue sources, can you be specific?\Coleman: The sales tax I do not consider a revenue source because you do reach a point when you bump up your sales tax it's just a bigger incentive for people to go somewhere else and buy their goods and services, makes it easier for people to want to cross the state lines to buy something or buy it over the Internet in a way that they're not paying the state tax. Our vehicles, when you buy your license, you could have a higher education fee tied on to that. You're going to end up seeing tuition increases. But I will say gasoline and automobile transfers are the most likely sources of revenue that will make a substantial impact on higher ed.\Q: Of course, everybody always wants to know about the MTSU science building. Is there any likelihood that's going to be funded this year in this depressed time?\Coleman: We didn't do any capital projects to speak of this past budget, and that was before things got real bleak, but MTSU's science building is the largest capital project of any university in the state of Tennessee, and it's also at the top of the list, so if there were a bond issue or if the federal stimulus package could include the bricks and mortar that are necessary to build that science building, those are two possibilities to get that science building completed. But with the existing state revenues and no bond issue, I don't think there's funding available.\Q: Do you think the budget's in such a situation this year that more state employees will have to be bought out or even laid off this year?\Coleman: Yes, the budget trend since July 1 is worse than we had projected, and last year when we did the budget, we actually went back and revised our initial estimates down and even after we made those adjustments downward, we're seeing the budget in worse, much worse condition than we had projected. But what we've run into, you've heard the figure a billion-dollar shortfall, if you lay off 2,500 employees making, say their benefits and their salary add up to $40,000, you've only saved $100 million, so you have to get at this problem not just through employees, because if you lay off employees, your services are reduced, you have to really cut some real meat and potatoes from what takes place at the state level.\Q: Do you think the Legislature will take any revenue away from local governments to save money this year.\Coleman: I don't think so. We get about $24 million, city and county, in shared revenues, and I don't think the state will take that away from locals. Now, I say that knowing that the Hall Income Tax is a revenue that comes to cities and counties, and my personal perspective on how that tax is allocated is that I think it's totally inequitable, unfair to county school systems and unfair to many cities also, because what happens with the Hall Income Tax is people pay to Tennessee based on the interest and dividends and then that money, a portion of it goes to the state and a portion goes back to the city or county where it was paid, which basically means if you live in Belle Meade, for example, you get all that money, and in my opinion, taxes should be used to pay for needs like education and health care, it shouldn't go to the entity that paid, the little town that paid it.\Q: Are you sponsoring any bill that you would say would be your priority bill this session?\Coleman: I do have a bill on the Hall Income Tax, I have two bills on that. I really haven't decided which one to push.\Q: The House speaker, I believe in (Wednesday's) paper, there was something about him wanting to pass a constitutional amendment to restrict abortions? Do you support that?\Coleman:Well, Roe v. Wade is the controlling authority on abortions, and Roe v. Wade is the result of a lady becoming pregnant in 1970. In 1973, Justice Blackmun gave the decision ... in which Texas had a statute that said abortion was not legal except in the case of health of the mother, and that was struck down. And basically it struck down all the state laws that were more restrictive than Roe v. Wade. So, when Tennessee passes a constitutional amendment, or the Legislature were to recommend an amendment, there is a real question as to does it have any effect or is it being done for political reasons. ... When it's all said and done, if we pass an amendment to the Constitution, if it falls under the federal court's case of Roe v. Wade, it will not be of any effect, because the state does not have the authority to overrule Roe v. Wade.\Q: How would you vote on that?\Coleman:It depends what it says. That's really the same way on any bill.\Info\Party:Democrat, 49th District\Age: 54\Education: Graduated Smyrna High Class of '73; Vanderbilt University bachelor's degree in economics and business in '77; Graduated from Nashville School of Law in '83\Career:Private law practice on Murfreesboro Public Square since 1984; previously worked in local banking industry\Family:Wife, Cecil; daughters, Ellie Lovvorn and Mary Wallace Broome; four grandchildren\Elected: 2002, starting fourth term\2009 House committees: Judiciary chairman, Finance, Ways and Means; and Calendar and Rules"
158,"To the Editor:\Hardly a day goes by when I am not stunned and disturbed by the increasing rate of our human rights being lost to technology. Case in point: a transmitter in your car that tells the gas pump how far you have driven (""State could require drivers to pay gas tax by the mile,"" Nov. 30).\***\Not only is this proposal ""Big Brother""-invasive, it represents a reverse tax. The people who have chosen hybrids at 60 miles per gallon will pay 500 percent more in gasoline taxes than the person who drives the 10 miles per gallon gas guzzler. The hybrids are lighter and emit less toxins; therefore, these automobiles are less taxing on roads and the environment.\However, the mileage tax seems to say, ""Let no good deed go unpunished."" But beyond this abominable reverse taxation is the feeling of ""give the government an inch and it will take a mile.""\So what if the technology exists? That in and of itself simply does not justify its use. At this rate, it won't be too long before cameras are in our houses and a GPS implanted in every newborn.\Surely, there is a better way to increase revenues than by encroaching on the home of the free.\Philip Self\Nashville 37221\Avoiding unhealthy foods hard yet possible\To the Editor:\Moses and Hippocrates, who were advocates of healing through proper diet, would agree with letter writer Roger Hoff, ""Doctors push too many pills on patients,"" Nov. 28.\Mr. Hoff is right when he suggests that people take responsibility for their own health. But that is sometimes easier said than done.\Of course it's easy to avoid recreational drugs, alcohol, tobacco and other addictive items if such use is never started. But sugar, snack foods and all those delicious but unhealthy treats are much more difficult to avoid in light of the fact that we are already captive eaters.\However, we can make better choices, right? Again, that's easier said than done. How is fresh vs. canned a viable choice when a single fresh tomato is more expensive than a can of tomatoes? A pear can cost more than a candy bar and a pint of blueberries can cost more than a package of candy bars.\It's easy to judge what is healthy to eat; just look on the store shelf and any item which is double the price of its comparable choice is the healthy item.\Exercising can keep you healthy. Running and walking are fantastic for your health, until you find yourself in the doctor's office with bad knees and on painkillers.\Hippocrates said, ""Let food be your medicine."" My cousin Roy said, ""I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't."" It's hard, but keep trying.\James Ramirez\Madison 37115\'Big Oil' cannot manipulate prices\To the Editor:\The AP article, ""Records: Big Oil cut flow, kept profit high,"" Nov. 26, on the ""Big Oil"" conspiracy was one of the worst pieces of reporting that I have read in your paper.\While delighting the conspiracy theorists, the reporter forgot to mention obstacles to drilling or new refining operations that governments (at all levels), environmentalists and the EPA put up. What about the 40 different winter gasoline blends that the EPA requires in various metro areas?\Finally, if ""Big Oil"" could manipulate prices, why didn't it hold supplies off the market when oil was $10 a barrel?\The most charitable characterization for this article is ignorance. Muckraking under the guise of reporting is unconscionable.\Ed VanVoorhees\Nashville 37215\Jet trails have been around quite a while\To the Editor:\Maybe Nov. 29 was a slow news day at the local desk, prompting the photo and article about jet contrails and conspiracy theories (""Jet trails just water vapor, not sprayed chemicals, experts say"").\This phenomenon has been around since turbojet aircraft began flying in the stratosphere, where ambient atmospheric temperature is low enough to turn water vapor in the exhaust gases, a natural byproduct of combustion, into ice crystals. This explanation is something for junior high science class, not Political Conspiracy 101.\That some adults are swayed by Internet myths and superstitions, notwithstanding scientific fact, into believing some other explanation, may reflect a sadder reality about the state of science education in this country. Add to that a loss of public trust and confidence in the activities of our government, and you have the stuff of weird political alchemy from which bogus conspiracy theories are brewed.\Our current executive branch may be up to some suspicious shenanigans, but I just don't believe it involves spiking jet fuel with chemical concoctions.\I'd rather see our investigative journalism resources applied to disclosing to us just what went on behind the closed doors of Dick Cheney's energy task force meetings in 2001 or why, just recently, the Saudi royal family summoned our vice president to Saudi Arabia, to name just two political mysteries.\Byron Hillblom\Antioch 37013\Conditions in Iraq unlikely to get better\To the Editor:\There are a lot of opinions on Iraq. Here's mine: Unless we are willing to conquer Iraq and name it East Carolina, what's the use? I think 10 years from now, it will be the same screwed-up country it was 10 years ago.\The quick fix idea of ""we'll turn it into a happy member of the free world"" is just not realistic.\Wouldn't it be nice if we could police the world and rid the planet of all oppressed people? Of course, but we know that's not going to happen, either. Young people are sacrificing their lives for a conflict that has no beginning or end. We're talking about a country that has lived in turmoil for thousands of years.\I'm a veteran, but I'm not in favor of this war. I am in favor of collecting money owed to us from this oil-rich nation. Unfortunately, we'll never replace the loss of life and limb suffered in the name of spreading democracy.\Mike Maiocco Sr.\Gallatin 37066\Will Rep. Pelosi heed terrorists' threats?\To the Editor:\I sincerely congratulate Nancy Pelosi on becoming the first female speaker of the House and for the Democrats' successes in this interim election.\As a conservative, I appreciate Madam Speaker's conciliatory words and call for a bipartisan government. Her example and words for unification should be followed, and not those of her party's recent presidential failures or of local Tennessee Democrats, who continue to bicker despite their party's overwhelming national win and ""mandate for change.""\I have one fundamental request for the Democrat-controlled House and Senate:\Keep our country safe. Work with the president regarding the ""war on terror."" Heed the jihadists' message. The president, like him or not, stated accurately that we must take the words of the terrorists and their supporters literally. If the leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, Abu Hamza al-Muhajer, says ""he has not had enough of our blood,"" or if Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, president of Iran, says he ""intends to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,"" then believe them.\Don't turn your cheek in hopes that this threat will simply go away. The jihadists' message and convictions are loud and clear: Convert to Islam or die by the sword. Frankly, neither option appeals to me.\Jihad pre-existed the current presidency. The time is now to put all divisive rhetoric behind us regardless of party politics. I dearly hope the example and new leadership of the Madam Speaker will contribute to the reunification of our great country. God bless America.\Bo Lovvorn\Nashville 37205\Columnist missed a larger truth on slavery\To the Editor:\I can understand The Tennessean's desire to give equal time to conservative columnists, but can't you please pick someone beside Kathleen Parker? Have you ever heard anything more ridiculous than her column on Nov 23, ""Glad that slavery's gone? Thank an evangelical.""\This is a perfect example of using selective facts (i.e., William Wilberforce's efforts in England in 1806), to distract from the greater truth that the white Christian church for centuries opposed doing away with slavery. It was black evangelicals, Catholics and Jews who most supported the civil rights movement in the '60s.\Let's be honest: The support of slavery by some Christian leaders is one of the darkest marks on the church's history.\Instead, let us hail those few who did have the courage to fight for abolition, like Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Jr., Wilberforce and others. We have a great one, right here in our city, author and white Baptist preacher and author, Will Campbell.\Howard Meek\Nashville 37217\ONLINE EXTRA\Many are upset with Bush over Iraq\To the Editor:\The most glaring of the many fallacies in Rollow Mickle's letter concerning the war in Iraq is his assumption that only liberals oppose President Bush's poorly advised venture. (""Blame Saddam, not Bush, for Iraq mess,"" Nov. 28)\If Mr. Mickle took note of the recent election he would understand a considerable majority made up of conservatives, liberals and even more important, moderates, gave Bush a huge ""thumbs down"" for having driven our nation into such a deceptive, poorly conceived, poorly executed and wholly unnecessary enterprise.\It is my hope this recent election not only enables America to finally disengage from Bush's blunder, but will also bring to an end this period of time when important national issues are debated based only on whether they conform to conservative or liberal thought. The lesson of this election shows the great American middle does not relate to the fanaticism on either end of the political spectrum but today looks only for government action that is rational, reasonable, well researched and effective.\Hopefully in such an atmosphere, polarized, black and white, ""them vs. us,"" ideological-driven letters such as Mr. Mickle's will no longer find such favor in the pages of The Tennessean.\Clark Santee\Hermitage 37076"
159,"By BILL THEOBALD\Tennessean Washington Bureau\BRAD SCHRADE and BEVERLY KEEL\Staff Writers\Even before officially announcing his bid for the 2008 Republican nomination for president, Fred D. Thompson had been selected as commander-in-chief twice.\Most recently in 2005's HBO film Last Best Chance and before that in 2001's television production Rachel and Andrew Jackson: A Love Story.\Known to most people as District Attorney Arthur Branch on the popular television show Law & Order, Thompson's acting credentials have been well established.\It may have been another role - that of a sideburned, 30-year-old Tennessee attorney asking an aide to President Nixon in 1973 whether he knew of any listening devices in the Oval Office - that set Thompson, 65, on an unlikely career path that has spanned politics, lobbying and acting.\The early years\Born the son of a used-car salesman on Aug. 19, 1942, in Sheffield, Ala., Thompson moved with his family when he was still young across the state line to Lawrenceburg, Tenn.\There, few could have predicted the fame and stature that lay ahead of him. They remember Freddie, or ""Moose"" as he was sometimes called, as the class clown - he was likable and smart, though not particularly studious. They also say he matured quickly and deeply after becoming a teenage husband and father. They describe him as a genuine and decent man with a knack for being in the right place at the right time.\After graduating from Vanderbilt University law school in 1967, Thompson began to become politically active.\Thompson first went to Washington as a protA(c)gA(c) of Tennessee's Sen. Howard Baker, after helping run Baker's successful re-election campaign in 1972. He was then appointed by Baker, the ranking Republican on the Watergate committee, as its chief minority counsel. After the Watergate hearings, Thompson went back into private legal practice, established a Washington office and began lobbying. He also took several temporary appointments to government jobs, including special counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1980 to 1981 and special counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee in 1982.\Thompson's first real acting job came in 1985, when he played himself in Marie, which starred Sissy Spacek and was filmed in Nashville. In the film, as in real life, he represented Marie Ragghianti, the chairwoman of the state's parole board who lost her job after reporting Gov. Ray Blanton's cash-for-clemency scandal.\Since then Thompson has appeared in Hollywood blockbusters such as Cape Fear, The Hunt for Red October, In the Line of Fire, No Way Out, Die Hard 2 and Days of Thunder.\Senate tenure\In 1994, Thompson - his acting career in full bloom - won election to the U.S. Senate seat vacated when Al Gore was elected vice president two years earlier.\It may have been his powerful political position, and not his acting roles, that finally sealed his celebrity status. Divorced from his first wife, he developed the reputation as a ladies' man and was romantically linked to country singer Lorrie Morgan, Time magazine's Margaret Carlson and cosmetics executive Georgette Mosbacher.\His celebrity also made him more than just another freshman lawmaker. Less than a week after he took office in December 1994 he was chosen to give the GOP response to a speech by President Clinton.\In those first years, Thompson displayed traits that would mark his Senate tenure. First, he was a reliable conservative voice. His votes consistently were ranked as more conservative than 80 percent of his Senate colleagues, according to the National Journal.\But he also had an independent streak.""I believe that Fred is a fearless senator,"" said former colleague Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. ""By that I mean he was never afraid to cast a vote or take a stand regardless of the political consequences.""\He was also a key player in passage of the McCain-Feingold legislation in 2001 - one of seven Republicans who voted for it. That vote remains the one black mark on his record among some conservatives, who saw the law as limiting free speech.\Thompson's life changed in 2002 when his daughter Elizabeth ""Betsy"" Panici died at age 38. He decided not to run for re-election in 2002, and on June 29, 2002, he married attorney/political consultant Jeri Kehn.\In 2005, Thompson showed up alongside Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005 as his White House-designated guide through the Senate confirmation process. Earlier this year, he helped raise money for convicted vice presidential aide I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby's defense fund.\Where Fred Thompson stands on the issues\IRAQ WAR\Thompson voted for the initial Iraq war authorization before he left the U.S. Senate in 2003. More recently, he said he supported President Bush's call for a surge of 21,500 troops to Iraq and opposes troop withdrawal, saying it would hurt the overall fight against terrorism.\""Some people in this country apparently think that if we can pull out of Iraq, our problems are going to be over,"" he said in an August speech. ""You and I know better than that. We know that Iraq is an important front in this war.""\IMMIGRATION\Thompson says he favors tighter security on the southern border. In a March radio commentary, he outlined the kind of talk he'd like to have with Mexico's leadership.\""Hey guys, you're our friends and neighbors and we love you, but it's time you had a little dose of reality. A sovereign nation loses that status if it cannot secure its own borders, and we are going to do whatever is necessary to do so, although our policies won't be as harsh as yours are along your southern border.""\TAXES\There is an ongoing debate whether Thompson supports the idea of replacing all federal taxes with a 23 percent national sales tax. Flat-tax supporters say Thompson pledged his support to the idea, something an earlier Thompson spokeswoman, who's no longer with the campaign, emphatically denied.\INFRASTRUCTURE\Thompson opposes a gas tax increase to raise money to repair crumbling bridges and roads.\""The cause of our infrastructure troubles is not a lack of money; but the politics and bureaucracy that have built up around the funding process,"" he blogged recently on his pre-campaign site, imwithfred.com. ""Why don't we let states determine which infrastructure problems are their priority? Are bridge repairs a priority in Arizona? Alaska? Hawaii? Maybe, but let's let the people decide what needs fixing, when, and how they want to pay for it-taxes, bonds, or tolls, for example.""\ENVIRONMENT\Thompson believes that the solar system is warming, not the Earth. His Senate record includes votes to open the Arctic wildlife refuges to oil drilling, to terminate engine emission standards for automobiles and eliminate federal efforts into renewable and solar energy research.\HEALTH CARE\Thompson says he strongly opposes universal health care, insisting that ""the grand experiments in bureaucratic medicine are coming apart at the seams"" in Europe and Canada.\ABORTION\Thompson says he is ""pro-life"" and calls the 1973 Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court abortion rights decision ""bad law and bad medical science.""\Thompson's Senate voting record earned him a perfect score from the National Right to Life association.\But in 1991, he reportedly accepted work as a consultant for a pro-abortion rights group, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, as it lobbied to lift a rule that banned abortion counseling at federally funded clinics.\GAY RIGHTS\Thompson opposes gay marriage but would let states decide whether to allow civil unions: ""Marriage is between a man and a woman, and I don't believe judges ought to come along and change that.""\GUN CONTROL\Thompson opposes gun control. ""Anybody who knows me knows I've always cared deeply about the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,"" Thompson wrote in an e-mail to supporters in August. ""So I've always felt sort of relieved when I flew back home to where that particular civil liberty gets as much respect as the rest of the Bill of Rights.""\- JENNIFER BROOKS\Thompson time line\Aug. 19, 1942: Fred Dalton Thompson is born in Sheffield, Ala.\September 1959: Marries Sarah Elizabeth Lindsey in Lawrenceburg.\April 1960: Son Fred Dalton ""Tony"" Thompson Jr. is born.\1960: Graduates from Lawrence County High School.\March 13, 1963: Daughter Elizabeth ""Betsy"" Thompson born.\1964: Graduates from Memphis State University.\April 1965: Son Dan Thompson is born.\1967: Graduates from Vanderbilt Law School.\1967: Joins wife's uncle's law practice in Lawrenceburg.\1969: Named assistant U.S. attorney in Nashville.\1972: Directs U.S. Sen.

Today is one of those rare occasions.\***\I was quite dismayed, while being ironically amused, at the connection I perceived between three articles in the Aug. 18 edition. The three articles I reference are: Hezbollah pays Lebanese victims $12,000: Scooters provide up to 100 mpg; and Chevrolet introduces 2007 Avalanche SUT.\The connection? Kristie Webb has parked her $40,000 Volvo SUV and purchased a $5,500 Vespa scooter to save gas while the ""Islamic Fascist"" Hezbollah terrorists provide reparations to their countrymen with crisp new $100 U.S. greenbacks given to them by Iranian oil interests. And yet Chevrolet is proud of its new gas guzzling offering in the ""Pig (I mean Big) Three"" SUT race.\By the way, Bob Plunkett, the syndicated reporter who penned the Chevrolet Avalanche report, failed to mention the truck's mpg. Just an oversight? I think not\Michael Korak\Hermitage 37076\Those who don't blink create danger on roads\To the Editor:\""Who'll blink first?"" This common expression, normally used to indicate a political or military confrontation, I would suggest, could be morphed to cover something much more under our individual control -- the interaction between drivers and their autos, i.e. who will turn on their car blinker when turning?\To quote the Tennessee Driver's License Handbook and Study Guide, ""Failure to signal is dangerous, inconsiderate and illegal."" Other driving handbooks add, ""Signal at least 50 feet before a turn.""\Nashville drivers are, by and large, adept to adequate in skill. But one frequent flaw is their failure to signal their turns -- not even considering failure to signal a lane change, which seems to be totally out of vogue.\But failure to signal adds a totally unnecessary risk to driving. It's easy to do, and it quickly becomes a habit. So come on Nashville, use your turn signals.\And, don't worry, if you see me coming and I'm going to turn, I'll blink first!\Janis Spivey\Nashville 37221\Nation must find its own sources of oil\To the editor:\President Bush used the wrong word when he said that we were addicted to oil. We are not addicted: Oil is a necessity. To get oil out of the necessity category will require a lot more than increasing the gas mileage requirement for new cars and increasing the federal gas tax to try to cut oil consumption.\Our enemy, which consists of almost the entire Middle East, has unlimited money to spend on defeating us -- our money. We send them $70 for each barrel of their oil, and their cost for that barrel is zero. With these huge amounts of our money they can finance any size operation against us. They can even afford huge public relations operations with our oil money: Witness Hezbollah's payments to the people whose homes were destroyed by Israel's actions.\The only possibility of reducing our money transfers to the Middle East is to find our own oil and oil that we can buy from countries that don't yet hate us and to start building several hundred nuclear energy plants in the United States.\Other solutions such as increasing car mileage and using solar cells and windmills can't even come close to fulfilling our energy needs to help us cut back our suicidal payments to the Middle East.\James B. Martin\Brentwood 37027\School officials need to explain magnet policy\To the Editor:\The school system's policy of letting magnet school slots go unfilled in the first days of the school year transcends being wrong and goes all the way to foolish. (""Parents upset over policy that lets magnet seats go empty,"" Aug. 23)\Magnet school vacancies occur for many reasons. For instance, some families' plans for magnet school change, and they (rudely) fail to tell anyone. Come the first day of fall semester, a seat that another child wants and deserves goes empty.\The first week of fall semester every year is full of transitions. Trying to fill empty seats at the magnet schools is easy. The space is there. The teachers are ready. The students are willing.\In the Aug. 23 article, the system's chief instructional officer simply says the policy is the policy. What is the explanation for the policy?\Tom Adkinson\Nashville 37215\Why is growth so good for Rutherford County?\To the Editor:\I am writing in response to the Aug. 22 article titled: ""Rutherford Growth Ranks 20th in U.S."" It quotes Candy Roberts of the Middle Tennessee Association of Realtors as stating that ""growth is the better option -- always."" But what the article does not explain is why is it better for 5,000 new homes to get built in Rutherford County this year?\The answer is that it is not better. Pretty much everyone who lives in Rutherford County now has a home already. Why is it obviously better for the current citizens of Rutherford County to have 5,000 new families from Texas, New York and California move to Rutherford County this year? Will it improve your quality of life to have these 5,000 new families move here? If so, how?\Residential development costs current taxpayers lots of money. That is a fact. Have your taxes gone up or down since Rutherford started growing? They have gone up, of course. Residential development makes schools big, crime-ridden and bad. It also requires that new schools get built. It makes traffic aggravating. It destroys farms and small businesses.\So why are all of these ""business leaders"" saying that ""growth is the better option -- always""? It is because Realtors get 6% of the price of every home sold. Take 6% of $150,000 and multiply that by 5,000 new homes, you see that realtors made $45 million off of the sale of these new homes just last year alone. Of course, she is for growth. I am a lawyer. Ask me if I am for or against lawsuits.\The pro-growth ""business leaders"" are pulling the wool over your eyes.

(""Pacman's journey had struggle, hope"")\Well, on Aug. 25, it was reported that Pacman was arrested outside a Murfreesboro bar for public intoxication, belligerent attitude and other assorted charges. Wonder what excuse his fervent fans will concoct this time to excuse his obvious criminal behavior?\I know, I'll bet it is because of his childhood upbringing and the environment he grew up in. One must never, never point the finger of blame at such a person, nor hold him accountable for his own actions. Where Pacman belongs is in jail for his continual criminal behavior. Would that I ever live to see the day when the affluent and powerful are held accountable for their own actions rather than a concoction of lame excuses by their apologists.\Pacman is certainly a sterling role model for young, aspiring athletes to imitate. Nashville should be thankful to Bud Adams for moving his franchise from Texas to Tennessee. It's too bad that an apparent excellent NFL coach of Jeff Fisher's character is stuck with a team of losers, and a player with such irreparable character as Pacman.\Charles David Sliger\Shelbyville 37160\Military draft would help build character\To the Editor:\I honestly think that the draft should be brought back to help some of these kids get some structure in their lives.\I am so sad to read almost daily of some teenager arrested for murder, robbery, rape or some other heinous crime that could have been prevented by parents if they only had the time. They let the kids take over control of their young lives much too soon, and that leads to the trouble we face today. If they think that the kids are impossible to slot into society today, just wait until they get out of prison.\Three years in a branch of the service will teach them all the things they need to survive and be an asset to everyone. An education, an appreciation of what democracy is, how to interact with others, some lessons in diplomacy, and certainly respect for your fellow man. It also would take the drain off our society that they bring on by committing crime after crime.\We are going to need responsible citizens if we plan on keeping America free. The draft would be a good start.\Jim Trusty\Old Hickory 37138\Why no death penalty for Perry March?\To the Editor:\If I could ask the Perry March jury one question, it would be this: Would you have voted for the death penalty if given the option? To me, it looks as if he's as culpable as any other death row inmate. Why no death penalty for him?\The fact that Perry March is going to prison for life weighs on my heart in terms of disparities. Why no death penalty for him? Is it because his murder wasn't as heinous as those who receive death, or because Mexico would not extradite if death was on the table? Or maybe it's because he's a white graduate of Vanderbilt Law School who has always lived a privileged life.\If the latter is true, let's toss Perry March in beside Low-Tax Looper and throw away the key. But while we're at it, let's also commute to life sentences the hundred odd inhabitants of Tennessee's death row who do not share these social characteristics.

161,"By SAM STOCKARD\STOCKARD@DNJ.COM\State Rep. Kent Coleman is entering his fourth term serving the 49th District of the state House of Representatives.\The Murfreesboro Democrat, who was reappointed Thursday as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, sat down with The Daily News Journal to talk about early events in the session and what could happen when it gathers again in February.\Q: What was your first reaction when all 49 Democrats decided to support Republican Kent Williams as the House speaker?\Coleman: My first understanding that that was a possibility took place in the caucus meeting, which was scheduled for 11 o'clock on Tuesday morning and we go into session at noon. At that time, we were informed that the existing speaker (Rep. Jimmy Naifeh) could not get the votes necessary to elect a speaker, and somebody submitted the proposal that Kent Williams would vote for himself if he were going to get elected as speaker, and the only way he could get elected as speaker, in our mind, was for all the Democrats to vote for him. But at the time we first left our caucus meeting to go on to the floor, it was my impression that Kent Williams did not have the necessary votes to get elected speaker. Not until we recessed after the House members were sworn into office that we took a recess and received the commitments from some Democrats that might have in the past pledged their support to Jason Mumpower.\Q: From what I understand, Williams had made some commitments to the Republican Party to vote for their caucus nominee. Do you believe he misled Republicans?\Coleman: I really don't have any idea. I do know both parties do the best job they can to try to get their caucus members to vote for their caucus nominees. But knowing the history of Kent Williams getting elected to office and knowing that he didn't seem to have the state Republican Party's support behind him, it was not surprising that he showed some independence in his vote for the speakership. He originally got elected by beating Rep. Jerome Cochran who had the party's support. Evidently, several legislators and Jerome ran against him after Kent had been elected, and Kent the entire two years he's been in office is clearly an independent thinker and believed that he got elected by the voters in Carter County and he doesn't need to be told how he's supposed to vote by a party leader in Nashville or any other leader in East Tennessee. He's supposed to represent the state and his constituents.\Q: Do you feel like this sort of cast Democrats in a bad light by throwing all their support behind a Republican to kind of steal that House speaker's post away from the Republicans?\Coleman: No, I think the duty of the Democrats was to do what the Democrats felt was in the best interests of Tennesseans, and we had no ability to elect a speaker from the Democratic caucus. And we were looking to elect someone that had demonstrated some common sense and some leadership skills, and that's what led some of our party members to have some discussion with Kent Williams. I think the frustration that might be taking place right now appears to be primarily pitting Republican versus Republican. I don't think any of the Republicans in Nashville really feel any of the Democrats did anything wrong. In fact, the Democrats did exactly what the Republicans had tried to do. The Republicans had made a strong effort to get several Democrats to commit to vote for Jason Mumpower in order to have insurance votes that would have gotten him elected speaker. And it's my impression that Jason had made inroads with several legislators in getting some commitments, but evidently those commitments didn't pan out.\Q: Now Jason Mumpower is alleging that Kent Williams sexually harassed two women, including one state rep. Do you think that's going to affect the House speaker's ability to get the job done this session?\Coleman: I think what is shows, considering that the allegation took place about two years ago, in that it was brought up (Tuesday), that there are very hard feelings internally right now between different factions of the Republican delegation in Nashville. I have no idea about any of the facts surrounding the allegation, but it is quite unusual that it resurfaces after the allegation was made, that there doesn't appear to be any complaints about how it was dealt with during that two-year period. So I do think there is some political angle to the story that came out (Tuesday) that shows Kent Williams is going to have troubles trying to work with the Republican Party. But it might be something over time Kent is able to overcome, but it will take ... awhile for some of the leadership in the Republican Party to feel comfortable working with Kent.\Q: Jimmy Naifeh's been given the title of House speaker emeritus. A lot of people feel like he'll be the one in control since he's been House speaker for years. How do you think that is going to work.\Coleman: First, let's talk about House speaker emeritus. Speaker Naifeh was speaker of the House longer than any Tennessean had served in that capacity, and emeritus just means you're retired with honor. It has no duties or responsibilities whatsoever. We've honored John Bragg for the service he gave to Tennessee on the Finance Committee, and that resolution which would have named Speaker Naifeh speaker emeritus was really just a resolution to acknowledge the activities and service that he had provided as speaker of the House of Representatives. So I don't really view that as anything other than a gesture of acknowledging the service he provided. The question of whether Speaker Naifeh will have any control over Speaker Williams, he certainly won't by being speaker emeritus because it has not duty or authority whatsoever, and based on my knowledge of working with Speaker Williams on the Finance Committee the past two years and meetings I've had with Speaker Williams, he will control those committees the way he thinks is best and without Speaker Naifeh having control over Speaker Williams' decisions.\Q: MTSU is being asked to cut $12 million to $19 for the coming fiscal year. Is there any way to cut any other department so higher education won't have to make such drastic reductions?\Coleman: If you look at Tennessee's budget, the total budget might be somewhere in the area of $27.7 billion. But a good portion of that money comes from the federal government and it has strings attached to it. You have to use it for the Medicaid program, so you've only got $13 billion you can spend that is state money, and of that $13 billion, a lot of that is directed. If it's from the gas tax, it has to go for roads, so you don't have a lot of discretionary money when you study the state budget. Forty-two percent of our dollars go to education, 28 percent goes for health care, 10 percent goes for law enforcement and jails, 7 goes for transportation, 7 goes back to the cities and counties on state-shared revenues, so that doesn't leave much money, about 6 percent of your budget to take care of parks, libraries, environment, conservation. And where MTSU really gets hit the hardest, there aren't really any matching funds that come to the state for us making any expenditure to higher education. It's a discretionary expenditure, so when you have a budget in an economy as depressed as our economy is, and there are no revenues coming in to take care of your appropriations, higher education is one of the likely areas that can get hit. As far as finding other areas where we spend money in the state and could we take that and give it to higher education, I would like to, but I don't think it's really there to shift because I believe that the lottery program and the growth of MTSU and the need to increase the number of people graduating from college in Tennessee, that those things just take place if we properly our higher education system. So, I think we need to look at revenue sources for MTSU and the whole Board of Regents and the UT system.\Q: When you talk about revenue sources, can you be specific?\Coleman: The sales tax I do not consider a revenue source because you do reach a point when you bump up your sales tax it's just a bigger incentive for people to go somewhere else and buy their goods and services, makes it easier for people to want to cross the state lines to buy something or buy it over the Internet in a way that they're not paying the state tax. Our vehicles, when you buy your license, you could have a higher education fee tied on to that. You're going to end up seeing tuition increases. But I will say gasoline and automobile transfers are the most likely sources of revenue that will make a substantial impact on higher ed.\Q: Of course, everybody always wants to know about the MTSU science building. Is there any likelihood that's going to be funded this year in this depressed time?\Coleman: We didn't do any capital projects to speak of this past budget, and that was before things got real bleak, but MTSU's science building is the largest capital project of any university in the state of Tennessee, and it's also at the top of the list, so if there were a bond issue or if the federal stimulus package could include the bricks and mortar that are necessary to build that science building, those are two possibilities to get that science building completed. But with the existing state revenues and no bond issue, I don't think there's funding available.\Q: Do you think the budget's in such a situation this year that more state employees will have to be bought out or even laid off this year?\Coleman: Yes, the budget trend since July 1 is worse than we had projected, and last year when we did the budget, we actually went back and revised our initial estimates down and even after we made those adjustments downward, we're seeing the budget in worse, much worse condition than we had projected. But what we've run into, you've heard the figure a billion-dollar shortfall, if you lay off 2,500 employees making, say their benefits and their salary add up to $40,000, you've only saved $100 million, so you have to get at this problem not just through employees, because if you lay off employees, your services are reduced, you have to really cut some real meat and potatoes from what takes place at the state level. The biggest ticket item is health care, and I think you'll find that the state will continue to spend less money that they don't have to spend according to federal regulations on health care.\Q: Do you think the Legislature will take any revenue away from local governments to save money this year.\Coleman: I don't think so. We get about $24 million, city and county, in shared revenues, and I don't think the state will take that away from locals. Now, I say that knowing that the Hall Income Tax is a revenue that comes to cities and counties, and my personal perspective on how that tax is allocated is that I think it's total inequitable, unfair to county school systems and unfair to many cities also, because what happens with the Hall Income Tax is people pay to Tennessee based on the interest and dividends and then that money, a portion of it goes to the state and a portion goes back to the city or county where it was paid, which basically means if you live in Belle Meade, for example, you get all that money, and in my opinion, taxes should be used to pay for needs like education and health care, it shouldn't go to the entity that paid, the little town that paid it. It just seems inequitable to me.\Q: Are you sponsoring any bill that you would say would be your priority bill this session?\Coleman: I do have a bill on the Hall Income Tax, I have two bills on that. I really haven't decided which one to push. Both of them have to do with coming up with a different way to allocate the money from the Hall Income Tax, and actually one of them deals with higher education, and one deals with more of a just dispersal based on the population of the counties.\Q: Are you going to be sponsoring any bills, you talked earlier about revenue, are you going to be sponsoring anything else that would bring in more revenue for higher ed?\Coleman: A lot of times that will depend on what committees you end up being on ... oftentimes what happens is, depending on what committee you're on that will affect who sponsors bills. In the past I've been on Finance Committee, and that would be a logical person for the governor to ask to sponsor his bill that might try to raise more revenue for higher education, or the Board of Regents or UT might want you to sponsor that bill.\Q: The House speaker, I believe in (Wednesday's) paper, there was something about him wanting to pass a constitutional amendment to restrict abortions? Do you support that?\Coleman:Well, Roe v. Wade is the controlling authority on abortions, and Roe v. Wade is the result of a lady becoming pregnant in 1970, in 1973, Justice Blackmun gave the decision ... in which Texas had a statute that said abortion was not legal except in the case of health of the mother, and that was struck down. And basically it struck down all the state laws that were more restrictive than Roe v. Wade. So when Tennessee passes a constitutional amendment, if the Legislature were to recommend an amendment, there is a real question as to does it have any effect or is it being done for political reasons. Now people feel strongly about the abortion issue, and there is no doubt in my mind it will pass on what's called first reading this year, but what it will say I do not know. That bill has always gone into a committee I do not serve on, which is the Health Committee. It has always failed in the Health Committee, and it's always been an emotional deal politically. When it's all said and done, if we pass an amendment to the Constitution, does it fall under the federal court's case of Roe v. Wade, it will not be of any effect, because the state does not have the authority to overrule Roe v. Wade.\And the other issue that will come up, pro-life means that you do not support any exceptions for rape, incest or the health of the mother, and it's my impression that you do have a lot of legislators that might claim they're pro-life but they support those exceptions, so this will be an interesting debate to see what final constitutional amendment does pass this year. And actually, it has to pass more than one General Assembly.\Q: How would you vote on that?\Coleman: It depends what it says. That's really the same way on any bill.\Q: Speaker Williams also mentioned that some sort of gun rights bill is at the top of his agenda. What is that?\Coleman: The top of the Republican agenda is guns, gun rights, abortion. On gun rights, I happen to have served on the committee where the gun bills have come each year. They come to Judiciary Committee. Right now, you cannot carry your firearm into a place that serves alcohol, onto the employer's grounds if the employer restricts their property and says no guns are allowed. You can't carry it into the courtrooms, and you can't carry it into parks and rec centers and schools. And that has been the law for many years, it was a law before I got elected, and it is still the law. I have seen nobody try to further restrict the carry-permit rights. The laws that have been proposed that failed in the past were more rights to carry on school grounds, more rights to carry in rec centers or parks, more rights to carry in places that serve alcohol. I haven't seen any bills dealing with carrying into courtrooms to the best of my knowledge. So those are the only areas that really are left to allow people to carry guns.\Q: Is there anything else you'd like add .. about what could be coming up this session?\Coleman: I think once you get through the gun bills, and I don't have any feel for how many will be brought, but I do think any that are brought and attempted to pass will pass because of the change in the majority in the House. I think once you get through whatever abortion amendment is proposed for the state Constitution, that the majority of the time is going to be spent on Tennessee's budget and rightfully so.\Q: You've got some paperwork there, Do you want to expound on what you think is going to go on with the budget.\Coleman: One philosophical discussion I think we'll have deals with the lottery and it has an indirect effect on MTSU. If you're cutting MTSU's budget by $10 million, one thing that might mean is you've gotta raise tuition to come up with more revenue for the institution, so if MTSU raises their costs, then you say, how are the students going to pay for it? One method is the lottery scholarship, because the lottery's not part of the state budget, it's a fund established to provide scholarships and last year, and we'll have the same argument this year, many people feel as though Tennessee needs to improve its graduation rates at the college level. We have 20 percent of our people in Tennessee get a college degree, 26 percent nationwide, so there's a huge gap that exists, and if an employer's looking to come to Tennessee that wants a staff that has more likely college degrees than not, Tennessee does not look favorable to that employer. So if you're only going to give the scholarship to the student that's getting a 3.0 in college, or 2.75 in college, you're going to weed out a good number of people that are going to college that might not have the best training in high school, but they're getting the right number of hours, they're progressing at the right rate, but they're just not being given the scholarship, therefore they end up not graduating. So last year, the scholarship efforts were on the Democratic side were to make it available to more people if they were getting the right number of hours, proceeding toward graduation and passing. But you had that argument versus giving it to the best and brightest students, so we reached a compromise. I think with the problems that higher institutions are facing and the need to raise their tuition, it's just going to reignite the argument that the lottery scholarship needs to be available to students that aren't the best and don't necessarily require that they be making beautiful grades in college.\Coleman: One philosophical discussion I think we'll have deals with the lottery and it has an indirect effect on MTSU.

I think you have to set the scholarship at the level that allows the student to be able to afford to go to college and if tuition goes up, I think you'll find the value of the scholarship will go up."
162,"U.S. has become magnet for welfare\To the Editor:\The Nov. 26 article ""Immigrant study questions welfare policy"" discusses the effects of the 1996 welfare reform law on immigrant children after defining ""immigrant children"" as those ""with at least one parent born outside the United States.""\***\Basically, the '96 law requires citizenship of new arrivals before they become eligible for all welfare programs. Citizenship can be obtained five years after arrival for legal immigrants. This is hardly a burdensome requirement.\Also, children born in the United States are automatically citizens, even if their parents are recent arrivals and even if they are here illegally. Access to welfare is not a problem for these children.\The foreign-born use all welfare programs at higher rates than do native-born. The Urban Institute would increase this dependence by extending federal welfare eligibility to all immigrants upon arrival. Currently, only refugees have this privilege.\Many groups support this effort. Governors and state officials think it is a great idea because federal money will take pressure off of states to provide services. Some business leaders and industrial farmers like it because they can pay low wages to immigrant workers knowing the taxpayer will help cover the cost of shelter, food and medical care.\Also politicians chasing the ethnic vote will support it as well as bureaucrats and public service unions with a stake in the expanding leviathan known as the federal government. Only the taxpayer suffers.\Using the Urban Institute's definition, my children are ""immigrant children,"" so let me say something that needs to be said: The United States is already a global welfare magnet.\If we cannot summon the courage to resist demands for more welfare for new arrivals, this country is toast.\Don Barnett\Brentwood 37027\dalbarnett51@aol.com\Plant's proximity to river is not a good idea\To the Editor:\I don't understand where the logic is in putting a uranium enrichment plant on the banks of the Cumberland River after $700 million and more than a decade was spent recently in an effort to clean it.\An article in a recent Tennessean focused on Gov. Sundquist's celebration of the ""success of the most ambitious urban clean-water effort in Tennessee history.""\The proposed plant's owner, Louisiana Energy Services, says that the plant will be safe and that there won't be any leaks. I'm sure the residents of Paducah, Ky., never imagined they'd be faced with the waste they now live with.\The Hartsville area site so near the Cumberland River is not a good location for the plant.\Barbara Crossman\Hartsville 37074\Bush team doesn't present united front\To the Editor:\For the past several months, I have been trying to decipher the true message of the United States on foreign policy that is being presented to the world. Not only is the official word of the White House not consistent, but also disturbing is that there seems to be little communication between the ""president's men"" as to what this all important message should be.\One day, Secretary of State Colin Powell discusses the apparent policy of the administration with reporters on the situation in Iraq, and the very next day in a speech to Republican supporters in Tennessee, Vice President Dick Cheney contradicts the secretary's statements.\In interviews, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill claims that a bailout for Brazil's failing economy would be fruitless and within days provides tens of billions in aid. In other statements to the press, Secretary Powell reveals apparent ideas for the situation in Korea only to have President Bush comment the next day reversing those suggestions.\Then there's Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who seemingly operates as though his department acts independently of any other in the government, paying little or no attention to statements made by colleagues in the White House. Perhaps there is little agreement within this administration as to what the foreign policy message of the United States should consist of.\Unfortunately, a united front should be a priority, particularly during an off-economy when the threat of a multi-front conflict in the Middle East is imminent.\James D. Qualk\Nashville 37215\NES employees deserve public thanks\To the Editor:\Who wants to be the first one on the block to complain about the NES workers now?\I say we owe them a long lunch.\Alan Stevenson\Adams 37010\alan0805@bellsouth.net\Voters came to their senses in November\To the Editor:\Various and sundry reasons have been offered and much running to and fro, searching for whom and what to blame for the results of the last election, as though it was a tragedy equal to Sept. 11, 2001.\A few years ago, the leadership of the Democratic Party had a meeting and announced afterwards, ""In the next few years, we are going to change the way America thinks.""\The Republicans that same year announced, ""We want to change government to the way the people think.""\Could it not be that, being of sound mind, reason and informed ""we the people"" spoke in the election?\Mazelle Wilson\Goodlettsville 37072\Alternative energy program needed here\To the Editor:\Kudos to The Tennessean for its Nov. 29 editorial supporting initiatives that promote renewable (green) power. It is a subject long overdue for discussion in Tennessee.\Due to an abundance of coal-fired power plants producing cheap but dirty power in this region, the Southeast lags the rest of the country in the embracing of alternative energy production.\Consumers in California are rebated 50% of their investment in renewable energy production such as solar and wind power. In New Jersey, it rises to 60%. Additionally, utilities in many places pay the owners of these systems for the electricity they produce at the retail rate, thus offsetting the consumer's electrical bill on a one-to-one basis. This is known as net metering.\There are currently no utility and tax rebates or net metering provisions in place for Tennessee consumers who would be inclined to purchase renewable energy systems to lower their overall energy usage while at the same time reducing this country's reliance on fossil fuels. As the editorial stated, these systems are expensive. But as we have seen in other parts of the country, individuals often are willing to make investments in the future when given reasonable incentives.\Our politicians in Washington need to immediately pass a national net metering law. We should have federal tax write-offs and utility rebates for capital investments in renewable energy production. TVA's Green Power Switch is a laudable program, which I participate in, but it is only a first step.\It has been pointed out many times in the past year that energy independence is a matter of national security. Every solar panel or wind generator installed reduces our need to go to war or to spoil the Alaska wilderness to fulfill our energy needs.\The results are immediate, the technology is healthy for the environment, and the need is dire.\Tommy Pinkston\Nashville 37209\Better to donate than smash pianos\To the Editor:\As a local piano teacher, I was stunned and sickened by the photograph and story of a grand piano being dropped by a helicopter onto a parking lot. (Dec. 4, Tennessean) I must have a grossly underdeveloped sense of humor because I cannot imagine what Henry Juszkiewicz was thinking when he put on this publicity stunt.\I also cannot imagine what pleasure any spectator, especially the mayor, could find in watching such malicious destruction of a musical instrument.\It certainly did symbolize the ""end of an era."" It ended the era when the owners of the Baldwin Piano Co. valued the craftsmanship and beauty of a grand piano. I refuse to believe that anyone who truly cares about music and especially pianos could ever do such a thing.\While it is admirable that Mr. Juszkiewicz plans to donate one piano every year to charity, he would have been better advised to donate two pianos this year. The piano that was destroyed - regardless of its make or condition - would have been treasured by many a needy school or church.\My students and friends often seek my advice when purchasing a piano. I won't soon forget this. It appears to me that Gibson saved the Baldwin Piano Co. from financial bankruptcy only to subject it to moral/musical bankruptcy.\Sue Ann Reinisch\Franklin 37067\AP classes are great for college preparation\To the Editor:\I am a senior at Martin Luther King Jr. Magnet High School, and I felt the Dec. 2 article about Advanced Placement classes was incomplete. Having taken and passed four AP tests already and going to the school that leads Metro in AP test passing rates, I feel I have some credibility on the subject.\I have had many wonderful AP teachers who challenged me to keep up with the fast pace and learn the material on my own. There are teachers at MLK who have a 100% passing rate for their AP classes. If these teachers can achieve such outstanding performance without restrictions on which students take the classes, then Director Pedro Garcia's goal for Metro AP test scores can become a reality.\The AP program at MLK could be a model to help improve test scores in Nashville. I feel that experiencing and passing AP tests has better prepared me for college. I hope more students will have the opportunity to have such experiences in the future.\Maggie Surface\Nashville 37205\surfam@comcast.net"

It increases energy efficiency and decreases storm-water runoff from the roof.\Beaman Park has a geothermal heating and cooling system.\Bells Bend, which opened last June, was selected for the solar energy system designed to save on electricity. Bells Bend also is a member of Generation Partners, a net metering system that buys back surplus power, said Gwen Griffith, program director for Cumberland River Compact's Outside the Box program. So when Bells Bend generates more electricity than it uses, Metro gets 15 cents paid back per kilowatt hour.\""We wanted the buildings themselves to be exhibits so people can see what they look like and learn about them so they can look at some of the ideas for themselves,"" said Sandy Bivens, Metro's director of the four nature centers, including Warner Park.

Somehow, within the maze of conveyors, catwalks and computers, the 500 employees at RPS's Nashville Distribution Hub know exactly where your package is.
\
Actually, the maze of conveyors, catwalks and computers helps them keep track.
\
RPS dedicated its huge hub facility, located just off Interstate 24 and Whites Creek Pike on Knight Road, on Thursday. The hub has been in operation since May, capable of processing 22,500 packages every hour, 14 hours a day, to serve customers across Tennessee and Kentucky and into Alabama, Indiana and Illinois.
\
``It's great to see a dream unfold like this,'' RPS President Ivan Hofmann said. As he finished speaking, alarms sounded and the conveyors ground to life behind him to begin sending packages to their destinations.
\
``We opened our company in 1985 with 11,000 packages in 37 facilities and less than 1,000 employees. We opened our Nashville facility that same year because we recognized the strategic importance of Nashville. It's where the action is. It's where the people are.
\
``We saw this area as a distribution center for the United States, and it's come true.
\
``Now we have 365 facilities in North America and move more than 1.4 million packages a day with 22,000 employees. And it's all happened because of customer support.''
\
RPS learned precisely how quickly it had to grow this summer, when the Teamsters struck United Parcel Service for 15 days in August.
\
The nation's largest package carrier -- UPS handles 12 million items per day -- had virtually shut down, and carriers like RPS scrambled to pick up the slack. RPS accepted no new customers during that period, but its volume increased by about 25 percent, chiefly due to a jump in shipping from its established clients.
\
The Nashville hub is RPS's 26th facility nationwide and one of its most technologically sophisticated, Hofmann said. It's situated on 96 acres with a single structure for offices and warehouse space nearly six acres in size.
\
Arriving packages are sorted via a fully automated handling system on nearly three miles of conveyors, allowing bar-code scanning at two and sometimes three points at a speed of more than 500 feet per minute. A scan, weigh and key system of identification is patented to RPS.
\
Once the packages are scanned and sorted -- packages under five pounds are hand-sorted for both efficiency and safer handling for delicate items -- they're stacked onto tractor trailers in one of 90 available loading docks for shipment to satellite terminals.
\
``We build a `wall' of packages in the trucks for the most efficient use of space and the safest shipping environment for the packages,'' explained Hub Manager Tom Mikulski, pointing out the jigsaw-puzzle-like effect in the trailer.
\
The hub's 500 employees are predominantly part-time sorters, Hofmann said.
\
``We have a lot of college kids because our sorts only run four hours and it's more convenient for them,'' the shipping president said. ``They can make a little money between classes. And we pay college tuition, too, because we pick a lot of our supervisory people from that pool of good workers. It's a good investment for us.''
