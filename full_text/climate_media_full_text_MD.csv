0,"Brace yourselves. President Barack Obama is expected to announce today new EPA rules to reduce carbon emissions from the nation's power plants by 20 percent and to force more polluters to participate in cap-and-trade programs. The inflammatory rhetoric from the opposition is likely to reach a Category 5 Event: Massive bloviation.\Conservatives, particularly that subset of flat-earthers who are skeptical of anything that smacks of ""science,"" are expected to pounce, first, because it involves addressing climate change; second, may be viewed as anti-coal; and third, involves executive authority, which they detest -- at least when it's wielded by a Democrat. They will rail against the regulations as costly, unnecessary and job-killing when, in fact, they are none of the above. \If anything, the prospect of reducing carbon emissions from existing power plants by 20 percent is almost criminally overdue. And the impact on electricity costs, coal production and the economy is likely to be modest -- if anything, it will produce more jobs in aggregate as new investments are made in greener energy, conservation and new markets for buying and selling government-issued pollution permits. \How can we predict this? Easy. Maryland has already started down this road as part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a nine-state coalition that has set limits on carbon-dioxide emissions in this state as well as New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island. Emission ""allowances"" are sold at auction and the proceeds are used to promote renewable energy and supplement energy costs in low-income households. \It has not pushed electricity prices significantly higher. It has not hurt the state's economy. It has not killed jobs. And while it's true that the domestic coal industry has suffered in recent years, it's obvious that the chief culprit has been the rise of cheap and readily available natural gas. Americans are destined to get more of their electricity from gas-fueled power plants thanks more to the development of drilling technology than government regulation. \Maryland demonstrated considerable foresight in jumping on a market-based program like cap-and-trade early, and now other states will need to follow that example. And it should not be a partisan effort either, as RGGI was endorsed by Northeastern governors of both political parties when it was first developed nearly a decade ago (including at one point by a certain former investment banker and Massachusetts governor named Mitt Romney). The failure of an energy bill that contained a national cap-and-trade program in the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate in 2010 was one of the most regrettable losses of the first Obama term. \Yet this is a classic win-win situation. Cap-and-trade has an  effect similar to a tax on carbon, allowing the marketplace to correct a worsening problem -- the failure to appropriately factor in the true cost of burning coal and other fossil fuels on human health and the environment. It's time to stop subsidizing the coal industry with our children's future. \Coal-fired power plants are this country's single greatest source of greenhouse gases and thus a major culprit in climate change. And it's also abundantly clear that a divided, sharply partisan Congress is fundamentally incapable of addressing this problem. That leaves only the Environmental Protection Agency and the White House to protect our future. \Make no mistake, this is not anti-business. A lot of folks in the utility industry will be pleased to see the regulations move forward, chiefly because it will finally bring some consistency to the market and create new opportunities for renewable power. Meanwhile, burning less coal will also mean reducing harmful and potentially cancer-causing byproducts like mercury and sulfuric acid that are a threat to human health and the environment as well. \Opponents can make all kinds of misleading claims about cap-and-trade, but they can't call it unproven. It's worked in the Northeast -- reducing power plant pollution by as much as 40 percent, providing $1.6 billion in new revenue for energy-related government investments and producing a negligible impact on consumers' monthly bills. The next step is to get the rest of the county on board, and then perhaps the U.S. can convince the world (at least those countries that haven't already taken similar steps) to follow.\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
1," Announcing a new, market-driven air pollution control program yesterday, the chief of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said the plan would help rid Maryland of persistent smog that threatens the health of one in three state residents.\ But state officials, pollution experts and environmentalists disagreed, saying that the plan won't guarantee a solution to Maryland's worst air pollution problem: a stream of gases and particles flowing east from old, coal-burning power plants in the Midwest.\ The EPA announced its program on the same day it informed 534 jurisdictions, including Baltimore City and 14 Maryland counties, that they're violating tough new health standards for smog-forming ozone, scheduled to be phased in over the next two decades.\ Baltimore City and its five surrounding counties were all listed as potential violators, along with Prince George's, Montgomery, Cecil, Kent, Queen Anne's, Calvert, Charles, Frederick and Washington counties.\ Maryland and 31 other states have until April 2007 to figure out how to clean their air in order to meet the new standards, which are aimed at reducing rates of chronic respiratory diseases and heart problems.\ The new standard has been in the works since the 1990s, when the American Lung Association and environmental groups successfully sued the EPA to set standards strict enough to protect the public health.\ Maryland, which has some of the country's worst ozone pollution, was never able to meet the old, more lenient standard.\ ""The biggest problem we've got is ozone transport from out of state,"" said Kendl P. Philbrick, acting secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment.\ In a letter to the EPA in July, Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. said Maryland's own pollution reductions are ""inseparable"" from equally steep cuts in the Midwest. He asked the federal agency to explain how it would force upwind states to clean their air.\ `They ignored it'\ In unusually harsh criticism from a Republican statehouse to a Republican White House, MDE's Philbrick said the government's reply, issued yesterday, did not address that issue.\ ""They ignored it,"" Philbrick said in an interview.\ But EPA Administrator Michael O. Leavitt, who took office in October, said the Bush administration considers the proposed pollution trading program, known as the Interstate Air Quality rule, an effective reply to the concerns of Maryland and other downwind states.\ Leavitt said the new program was unveiled on the same day as the list of communities that won't meet the standard because ""it would be unfair to put the [list] out without having a solution.""\ The administration is proposing a ""cap and trade"" program, similar to one already used to reduce acid rain. This new ""cap"" would set nationwide limits on power plant emissions of two common pollutants, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.\ Both can cause breathing problems on their own. Sulfur dioxide is also a component of acid rain, while nitrogen oxide contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone, or smog - a powerful respiratory irritant.\ The EPA wants to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 70 percent by 2015 and would cut nitrogen oxide by 40 percent.\ The ""trade"" portion of the program would allow utilities that can reduce pollution below target levels to sell the excess reductions as pollution credits. Companies that can't meet the goals would be able to comply by buying these credits, even if they don't actually reduce pollutants.\ ""This is the largest air pollution reduction in more than a decade,"" Leavitt said. Power plants would have to install new equipment at a cost of about $5.7 billion, he said.\ Leavitt, a former governor of Utah, said the proposal should satisfy officials in Eastern states who ""could close every power plant, in their mind, and take every car off the road, and still not achieve the reductions.""\ Regional remedies\ But Philbrick said Maryland has already told the EPA that the state opposes a cap-and-trade program without region-by-region reductions. Otherwise, he said, ""I don't think it's helpful,"" because it would allow Midwestern utilities to buy credits instead of cleaning up their plants.\ Air pollution professionals and environmentalists called the EPA proposal a back-door scheme to implement a Bush Administration plan to revise the Clean Air Act. The Bush plan, known as the ""Clear Skies Initiative,"" bogged down in Congress after critics charged that it would weaken the nation's principal air pollution law.\ States that don't meet the new standards could lose federal highway funds, a sanction that environmentalists concede is rarely imposed.\ Credit: SUN STAFF"
2,"In a little more than a year, a regional push to cap greenhouse gases has raised millions for Maryland energy programs, with supporters calling it a model for easing climate change on a national or even global scale.\Since September 2008, Maryland and nine other Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states have been participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. In its ""cap and trade"" regulatory scheme, emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants have been capped and plant operators are required to buy permits for all the gas that their facilities release into the atmosphere.\Similar programs, in which businesses buy and sell the rights to release greenhouse gases, are being considered for extension nationwide under legislation in Congress that passed the House last summer and is pending in the Senate. It's also on the table for international action at rancorous United Nations climate talks scheduled to conclude Friday in Copenhagen.\""While Washington and the world debate this in Copenhagen, we've already exercised leadership and proved that cap-and-trade can work, said Malcolm Woolf, director of the Maryland Energy Administration, ""and we are investing the proceeds in helping families and businesses.""\Some business groups and conservative critics have warned that cap-and-trade regulation of greenhouse gases could cripple the U.S. economy, driving energy prices through the roof and putting millions out of work. Some economists and environmentalists also oppose the approach, arguing that it's too complicated and fraught with loopholes to make a real dent in emissions that threaten to drastically alter the world's climate.\But power companies in Maryland and the nine other states have been paying for the rights to emit greenhouse gases for more than a year with slight impact on consumers' electric bills. Baltimore Gas and Electric Co.'s residential customers are paying perhaps $1.25 a month more as the costs of the carbon-dioxide permits are passed through, said Constellation Energy spokesman John Quinn. That represents about 1 percent of the average household's electric bill.\Meanwhile, the state has collected more than $96 million in revenue from the six carbon-dioxide auctions held since September 2008, with the funds earmarked for providing relief from energy costs and ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\Specifically, half the funds this year go to help poor families pay their power bills, while nearly a quarter goes to provide a bit of rate relief for all residential utility customers - about 43 cents on the typical household power bill this winter, according to Quinn.\Another 18 percent goes into promoting energy efficiency and conservation, with an additional 6 percent earmarked to provide grants and low-interest loans for homes and businesses to install ""clean"" energy systems.\Frank and Lois Bohdal are among more than 600 Marylanders this year who have received state grants funded in part with carbon-auction proceeds to help them put in home solar, wind or geothermal energy systems.\Bohdal, a computer programmer with the state comptroller's office, has blanketed the south-facing roof of the couple's Millersville rancher with 40 solar panels. They cost a total of $55,000 - but the state helped cover their installation with nearly $14,000 in grants. And the electricity they generate has reduced the couple's power bill by nearly a third.\""So far, it's been worthwhile to me,"" said Bohdal, who notes that he was able to cover about half the upfront costs with federal and local tax credits.\Some of the carbon-auction funds also are going into retrofitting low-income apartment complexes with better insulation and energy-efficient appliances and lighting. The state recently awarded grants to fix up the 158-unit Sierra Woods apartments in Columbia and another complex in Montgomery County. Using the auction proceeds and federal stimulus funds, the state hopes to work on nearly 1,600 apartments this year.\""We do believe that in the long haul it will help make these properties and the rents more sustainable for our residents,"" said Pat Silvester of the state Department of Housing and Community Development, which is overseeing the projects.\The regional effort in the East has inspired similar collaborations of states in the Midwest and the West, and supporters believe it helped build support on Capitol Hill for the cap-and-trade plan to curb greenhouse gases that is written into the bill that passed the House in June. A similar approach is being considered in the Senate.\But some note that the greenhouse gas initiative wasn't much of a test of the idea of using the market to achieve pollution reductions, since states purposely set their caps on carbon dioxide above what power plants were emitting at the time. The price of pollution allowances sold by the states have ranged between $2 and $3.50 per ton, while the Environmental Protection Agency estimates carbon credits would sell initially for $12 to $15 per ton under the more sweeping cap-and-trade approach in the House bill. A congressional budget analysis found that the cost per household in higher energy bills would average $175 a year.\Maryland officials say the states intentionally set a loose-fitting ceiling on carbon-dioxide emission for the first few years so power plants could get used to paying for pollution allowances.\The plan is to gradually reduce the allowable emissions 10 percent by 2018, ultimately making the allowances more valuable, and costly.\Bids for the carbon credits through six auctions have been within the range projected by the states, but they've trended downward lately. In the most recent auction Dec. 2, carbon dioxide allowances went for $2.05 each, down from a high of $3.51 per ton in March. And for the first time two weeks ago, the states were unable to sell all the allowances they had put up for bid on future emissions.\Karen Palmer, an economist with the Washington think tank Resources for the Future, said bidding appears to have cooled on the regional carbon auctions partly because of uncertainty about how it would be affected by federal legislation. The bill that passed the House would effectively replace the regional power-plant curbs with a nationwide cap on all greenhouse gases, though the pollution credits sold under the regional auctions could still be used to help meet the new, more rigorous federal control scheme.\Another reason for declining bids, Palmer said, is the slumping national economy, which has reduced the demand for carbon-dioxide permits now. Power plant emissions have declined as the business downturn lowered demand for energy, she pointed out.\With recent auction proceeds less than projected, that's forced the states to pare back what they can expect to get and spend on energy programs. In Maryland, though, Woolf says the drop in carbon-auction proceeds has been made up for by an infusion of federal economic stimulus funds earmarked for energy efficiency and clean energy efforts.\""The ultimate goal was always to demonstrate for the country that a cap-and-trade system could work,"" said Shari T. Wilson, Maryland secretary of the environment. ""Really, that goal has been accomplished.""\Some argue that imposing a tax on carbon would be a better way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They acknowledge, though, that cap-and-trade garnered support, at least initially, from businesses and from many environmentalists.\Charles Komanoff, co-director of the Carbon Tax Center, said some green groups evidently believed the market plan would be a ""stealth"" way to tax carbon, and he contended that businesses were looking to write special deals for themselves into the complicated House bill, which runs to more than 1,000 pages. Senate action has been delayed by debate over health insurance reform, though members also remain split over the bill's economic impact and some even question scientific evidence of climate change.\The regional experience with cap-and-trade has won over Constellation Energy, it seems. ""We were supportive of an experiment,"" said company spokesman Quinn, ""that a market-based system that put money back into solving the problem wasn't a bad idea.""\Now, he added, ""It's time to do a comprehensive program, rather than piecemeal it."" The company's chairman and CEO, Mayo A. Shattuck III, issued a statement at the beginning of the U.N. climate summit supporting an international accord committing the United States and all other countries to reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases.\Credit: tim.wheeler@baltsun.com"
3,"WASHINGTON -- Insurance companies refuse to underwrite new flood policies along coastal areas of the Eastern Shore. Rising sea levels eat away at islands in the Chesapeake Bay. The federal government blocks the state from enforcing greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks.\These are the challenges that concern environmental advocates in Maryland. That is why many are gratified to see climate change became an important issue in the presidential campaign leading up to Maryland's the primary vote tomorrow.\""One of the most critical questions for the candidates has been their stance on global warming,"" said Josh Tulkin, deputy director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network. That's good news, Tulkin says, for Marylanders.\""All the EPA modeling shows that the Chesapeake region, especially Maryland, is one of the most vulnerable regions to sea-level rise, severe weather and other impacts of global warming,"" he said.\""This isn't about polar bears. This is actually about an impact on people in Maryland.""\""Global warming is the exact right [issue] for them to be focused on,"" agreed Brad Heavner, the state director for Environment Maryland.\""We want in Maryland and across the country to build the clean energy economy, and it can have huge benefits from the beginning and deal with this enormous environmental problem.""\The campaigns have taken notice.\""What kind of a planet are we going to pass on to the next generation of Americans?""\Sen. John McCain asked during a debate in December. Of climate change, the Arizona Republican said, ""It's real, we've got to address it, we can do it with technology, with `cap and trade,' with capitalist and free enterprise motivation.""\The major candidates in both parties all have talked about curbing the greenhouse gases that scientists say contribute to global warming and promoting clean new energy sources.\That could mean good news for the likes of BP Solar, which is more than doubling its solar panel manufacturing plant in Frederick, and U.S. Wind Force, the Pennsylvania company that wants to lease state forest lands in Western Maryland to build electricity-generating windmills.\But Will Baker says it isn't enough. Baker, the president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, wants to hear the candidates address environmental issues beyond climate change and alternative energy.\""Certainly our polling and other polling shows people are very concerned about clean water and clean air as basic, fundamental rights,"" he said. He spoke of how low-oxygen ""dead spots"" in the bay and a proliferation of toxic algae are threatening health, the food supply and recreational activities.\""All of these, I think, are critical not only to the Chesapeake Bay but to the planet as a whole,"" Baker said. ""While energy independence is one aspect of the environment, simply stopping pollution at its source is another.""\So far, the candidates have confined their comments largely to climate change and energy independence. McCain drew criticism from then-opponent Mitt Romney for his sponsorship of legislation that would curb greenhouse gases with ""cap and trade"" - placing a limit on emissions and requiring polluters to obtain permits that could be bought or sold.\Romney, who supported a similar program when he was governor of Massachusetts, said the McCain-sponsored bill would drive up energy costs. He agreed with McCain and another Republican candidate, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, on promoting clean new energy sources.\""Is global warming an issue for the world? Absolutely,"" Romney said in a December debate. ""Is it something we can deal with by becoming energy independent and energy secure? We sure can.\""But at the same time, we call it global warming, not America warming. So let's not put a burden on us alone and have the rest of the world skate by without having to participate in this effort. It's a global effort,"" said Romney, who withdrew from the race last week.\There is more agreement among the Democrats. Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois have detailed lengthy proposals to address climate change and energy independence with cap-and-trade programs, increased fuel efficiency and renewable energy standards, and tax breaks and investment to promote alternative energy sources.\""We will enhance our security by making it clear to the oil companies and the oil-producing countries we are not going to be dependent and be basically taken advantage of any longer,"" Clinton said during a campaign stop last month in New Hampshire. ""And we can do it to deal with global warming.""\Obama said in December that his thinking on climate change was still evolving.\""I've put forward one of the most aggressive proposals out there, but the science seems to be coming in indicating it's accelerating even more quickly with every passing day,"" Obama said. ""And by the time I take office, I think we're going to have to have a serious conversation about how drastic [are the] steps we need to take to address it.""\The League of Conservation Voters has not decided whether to endorse a candidate, but spokesman David Sandretti called the proposals from Clinton and Obama ""very good.""\""They address the overall need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and they set forward goals that accomplish those,"" Sandretti said. ""On the Republican side, clearly one candidate stands out, and that's John McCain. He has been working on this issue for a number of years, he has legislation that will reduce greenhouse gases, has a target, it's economywide. Unfortunately, his goals are not what we feel are necessary to stem the worst effects.""\Maryland is one of 15 states that were blocked by the federal EPA in December from introducing limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks. Clinton and Obama have signed on to legislation that would enable the states to enforce the new rules without EPA approval.\In a Republican debate last month, Huckabee, McCain and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas all said the states should be free to develop their own regulations.\None of the candidates have offered details specific to the Chesapeake Bay. Baker, of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, hoped that would change when the candidates came to the region to campaign.\""We'd like them to see the Chesapeake Bay, to see the rivers like the Potomac, the Susquehanna, the Rappahannock, the Patuxent that drain into it, and to see the kind of support cleaning up this national treasure has among the people,"" he said. ""We've found that when elected officials from Gov. [Robert] Ehrlich to Gov. [Martin] O'Malley in Maryland, Gov. [Tim] Kaine in Virginia, when they learn about the issues and sense the importance of them among the electorate, they will work to try and improve them.""\matthew.brown@baltsun.com\Credit: Sun reporter"
4,"A burden on the working class. A jobs killer. A hidden tax on every purchase. That's' just some of the strong invective hurled at the concept of cap-and-trade programs by their politically conservative critics in recent years.\But a funny thing has happened to those 10 states, including Maryland, that actually signed on to what's known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and started requiring power plant owners to purchase allowances for each ton of carbon dioxide they emit. A recently released study of the program's first three years shows, it's been a major boon to both the residents of those participating states and the economy.\How major? There's the surprise. According to researchers, the regional economy has gained more than $1.6 billion in economic value. That's not the gross effect but the net, once researchers considered both costs and benefits to the economy.\But wait - wasn't the complaint from conservatives that a cap-and-trade program would raise electricity prices and therefore raise expenses to households not only in energy costs but also many goods and services? Researchers found that while it's true that RGGI payments can increase electricity prices in the near term, there's also a lowering of electricity prices over time, as states invest more money in programs that promote energy efficiency.\Even those households that have not caulked a single window or added insulation to a single attic share in that benefit as demand for electricity falls in the marketplace. On average, residential customers in RGGI states saved $25, commercial customers $181 and industrial consumers $2,493 each, according to the study by Analysis Group, an economic consulting firm.\While that reduced demand is not necessarily good news for energy suppliers, it is for their customers. The study estimates that it produced about 16,000 jobs for the region - and also notes that no power supplier went into the red as a result.\Not every state had an identical rate of return. Maryland, for instance, didn't have as large a rate of return as New England states that invested more of their RGGI proceeds on energy-efficiency upgrades, but it still came out well ahead.\Perhaps the most important lesson is that as a market-based solution, a cap-and-trade program can deliver real economic value to participating states.\The most obvious benefit is to reduce the region's demand for fossil fuel. It also translates into cleaner air, as coal-fired power plants produce less toxic smoke. But there are also dividends provided to neighboring states - especially to the degree that RGGI reduces purchases from out-of-state power plants that, in turn, don't burn as much coal.\One can only hope that Congress might be paying attention. A similar program - even one that allows states to determine how proceeds are spent - could work on a national level.\But first, it will require Republicans to acknowledge climate change is a real and pressing problem. The GOP might also acknowledge that conserving energy, saving money and reducing pollution are benefits of cap-and-trade as well.\Too bad that conservatives seem trapped in a catechism that insists all government regulations are harmful to the economy and that man-made global warming is a fallacy. That both views are so clearly refuted by the hard evidence at hand seems of little consequence to the deniers.\Incidentally, one of the places to benefit from RGGI was New Jersey, where Gov. Chris Christie announced last May that his state would no longer participate in 2012 because he saw no economic or environmental benefit from continuing to do so. The study refutes that claim but does show a lesser return for the Garden State - but only because the majority of the proceeds were used to help balance the state's budget.\Perhaps a more realistic expectation is that other states - less encumbered by the closed-minded partisan politics of Washington (or led by governors that aspire to one day be the GOP presidential nominee) - will try to duplicate RGGI's success and offer similar regional programs drawing from the best practices demonstrated by RGGI participants.\Cap-and-trade isn't the jobs killer that the naysayers claimed but a boost to the economy at a time when jobs are at a premium. Even setting aside all the considerable benefits that come from lowering fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, that ought to be enough to spur others to join in.\Credit: The Baltimore Sun"
5,"The dog days of summer are upon us, and most Marylanders are more inclined to reach for beach-friendly paperbacks than a 265-page treatise on climate change. That's a shame, because the latest effort to address greenhouse gas emissions in Maryland -- an ambitious plan released last week by Gov. Martin O'Malley -- ought to be required reading, particularly by those who dismiss such efforts as too costly or unnecessary.\Here's the CliffsNotes version: Climate change is real, it's accelerating, it's potentially disastrous, and Maryland, with its hundreds of miles of coastline, wetlands and coastal development, is more vulnerable than most. The question is not so much whether the state should take aggressive action but how best to meet some reasonable goals. \In releasing this latest plan -- a road map to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020 -- Governor O'Malley described the work as ""hard ... life-and-death hard."" He's absolutely correct. None of it will be easy, certain sectors of the economy will feel the pinch more than others, and it would be far less aggravating for Maryland to let others make the needed sacrifices first. \But to choose inaction because neighboring states aren't doing as much to reduce emissions (or even because neighboring countries aren't) would be the equivalent of not bailing out a sinking life raft because the other occupants are too slow to do the same. You don't wait, and you don't crow about moral victories or leadership (sorry, environmental community); you do it because you don't want to drown -- or for the next generation destined for the raft to drown either. \But here's the other point made clearly by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Plan: This is not a matter of picking your poison or choosing whom to sacrifice, it's actually a potential win-win for Maryland. While it's true that some businesses will face higher costs, the net effect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be more jobs and a boost to Maryland's economy. \As a 2011 report by the Regional Economic Studies Institute of Towson University pointed out, the new standards should result in a net increase of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in public and private investment and tens of thousands of jobs. And that's not even counting the economic benefit of improved human health or a cleaner environment from lower pollution. \Naysayers may remain skeptical, but Maryland has already taken substantial action to reduce the state's climate change footprint. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has used an emissions cap-and-trade system to invest millions in energy efficiency, clean energy technology and other consumer benefits, and the Clean Cars Program has reduced tailpipe emissions (and raised fuel efficiency standards) -- both examples of progress that has already been made without harm to the economy. \Perhaps that's not a lot of comfort to people who want cheap, coal-fired electricity and don't care about the sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and toxic metals -- in addition to the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases -- those power plants are pumping into the air. But those jobs are illusory because they are not sustainable. The sooner Marylanders understand that and accept more forward-looking policies, the sooner the state's economy will be positioned for long-term growth and the green jobs that will be a part of it. \Can Maryland by itself reverse the global levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (recently measured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at 400 parts per million, the highest level in 3 million years)? Of course not. But to postpone the needed actions would be like ignoring public pension debt until, like Detroit, it's time to file for bankruptcy. Delay only makes the consequences worse, with this additional caveat: One can survive bankruptcy, but there isn't a spare planet available. The sooner action is taken, the easier the transition will be and the sooner the state will enjoy the benefits of those policies. All that's lacking is the political will. \Mr. O'Malley, a possible candidate for president in 2016, obviously intends for his climate change efforts to get noticed beyond Maryland's borders, but that doesn't make them any less correct. Cut past the rah-rah about leading the nation, and the problem remains really simple. Maryland's per-capita greenhouse gas emissions are four times of that of China and twice what Europeans contribute. We need to clean up our act -- not only for simple self-preservation but because it presents an economic opportunity as well.\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
6,"WASHINGTON - - By brokering a climate deal in Copenhagen a week ago, President Barack Obama has committed himself to a more daunting task: pushing for comprehensive climate legislation in the Senate next year.\Although many senators, especially key Republicans, have shown little appetite for backing yet another ambitious bill in the aftermath of the polarizing health care debate, it is clear that enacting legislation to cap the U.S. carbon dioxide output and allow polluters to trade emission permits is essential to delivering on the pledges that Obama made to other world leaders.\In an interview with The Washington Post last week, Obama said, ""There is no doubt that energy legislation is going to be tough, but I feel very confident about making an argument to the American people that we should be a leader in clean energy technology - that that will be one of the key engines that drives economic growth for decades to come.""\White House spokesman Ben LaBolt said the fact that ""countries like China and India set carbon-intensity targets for the first time in history"" should bolster the administration's legislative effort.\Since taking office in January, Obama and his deputies have regarded international climate talks as a way to get the sort of commitments from major emerging economies that would allow them to sell a cap-and-trade bill to skeptical lawmakers back home. As part of last week's accord, the four biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the developing world - China, India, Brazil and South Africa - agreed to list voluntary climate targets as part of an international registry and to allow third-party countries to scrutinize whether the four are making the emission cuts they say they are.\Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the top Republican on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and a swing vote, called language in the Copenhagen deal allowing for verification of developing countries' carbon cuts ""a very small step forward.""\""Right now, the big question is whether the Senate, as a whole, can sit down and craft real bipartisan legislation that protects both the economy and the environment,"" Murkowski added. ""We need to find ways to move forward in a bipartisan effort that makes sense for America, regardless of whether the rest of the world follows through or not.""\In the wake of the health care debate, winning Republican support for such a bill is crucial, even if it might mean adding provisions favored by the nuclear and oil industry, or scaling back the legislation's scope.\And Obama has little choice but to press the issue. He and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton pledged in Copenhagen that the United States would help mobilize $100 billion in annual funding by 2020 to help poor countries cope with global warming. Administration officials said a significant portion of the U.S. contribution would come from carbon trading markets where polluters would have to buy emission allowances from the federal government and offset some of their emissions by investing in forestry projects overseas.\Environmentalists and some allies on Capitol Hill are confident that Obama is invested enough in the issue to focus on climate legislation next year. Jeremy Symons, senior vice president of the National Wildlife Federation, said last week's deal ""helps us down the path to 60 votes by taking the China excuse off the table and teeing this issue up as a presidential priority for 2010.""\Even so, says Ned Helme, president of the Center for Clean Air Policy, senators will be watching to see whether the promises China and others made in Copenhagen get translated ""into something real.""\Credit: The Washington Post"
7,"SEE RELATED STORY (Ehrlich: After a shaky start, some recent moves have pleased opponents.)\ THE ENVIRONMENT has been a major issue in national political campaigns for a whole generation now.\ The 2000 presidential race cleaved along what are now the traditional political fault lines - George W. Bush portraying Al Gore as a ecological wacko who would force everyone to start riding tricycles to work, while Gore painted Bush as a toady of big business who would happily open the floodgates of pollution.\ But as another presidential campaign approaches, the environment is making only token appearances, taking an unaccustomed seat in the back of political disagreements dominated by war and the economy.\ In part, this is because one of the main motivators of environmental concerns - the possibility of unmitigated disaster - has been overshadowed by the very real disaster of Sept. 11, 2001.\ ""Terrorism has kind of overwhelmed environmental fears,"" says Robert H. Nelson, a land use specialist in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Maryland, College Park. "" The environmental groups have lost some of the oomph. It is hard to get the public aroused when the public is more focused on terrorism.""\ In the pre-9/11 days - when people were still paying attention - Bush drew criticism for his unilateral rejection of the Kyoto accords designed to stem global warming by limiting emissions from developed countries.\ ""I think that with the Kyoto protocol, it was important that we put some pressure on negotiators to get changes in the current agreement,"" says Matthias Ruth, director of the Environmental Policy Program at the University of Maryland, College Park. ""But the way the adminstration approached it was not the best way to go about that.""\ Ruth says Bush was wrong to say that scientists were still undecided about the link between greenhouse gases and global warming. ""In the scientific community, that is really not an issue anymore,"" he says. ""Some people might debate the nuances, but there is widespread agreement that this is happening. Pointing to the remaining uncertainties was not really a smart move.""\ Bush also said it without bringing along any allies, arousing the charge of unilateralism that persists in his war on terrorism.\ Post-Sept. 11, Bush has managed to make most of his environmental moves - even those that draw criticism from the conservation community, such as relaxing the restrictions on arsenic in drinking water or not raising fuel efficiency standards for U.S. automakers - without that much controversy.\ Matthew Crenson, a political scientist at the Johns Hopkins University, notes that many decisions that affect the environment are no longer made by elected bodies, but by bureaucrats.\ ""It used to be Congress was the arena where these things were worked out,"" says Crenson.\ That led to lengthy debates and continuing coverage.\ ""Now the arena is more likely to be administrative and bureacratic. It is much less visible,"" he says. ""There are far fewer participants. In order to find out what's going on, you have to be a regular reader to The Federal Register. If it makes the news, it's a one-day story.""\ Sandy Parker of the Department of Geography and Environmental Systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, says he sees the Bush administration using tactics that he saw in the Reagan administration. ""They don't attack a law head-on but they basically emasculate it by doing things like weakening the review process,"" he says.\ Ruth agrees. ""They went about it more or less strategically picking on individual issues, gnawing away, a little here and a little there,"" he says. ""And by and large, other than maybe drilling in ANWAR, not getting a lot of attention.""\ ANWAR refers to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that the Bush administration and many of its allies wanted to open up for drilling to search for oil. That ignited fierce opposition and the proposal was withdrawn. The publicity went away.\ Another potential hot-button topic - changing the regulation of national forests - made it through Congress with little fuss because of the huge fires that destroyed hundreds of houses in Southern California.\ Given a friendly name like most Bush measures, the Healthy Forest Initiative was sold as allowing the thinning of the forests to reduce their fire potential. But again many who look at its details see problems.\ ""Because of the fires in California, everybody wanted an anti- fire bill,"" says John Horowitz of the Agricultural and Resource Economics Department at the University of Maryland, College Park. ""But this opens up particular areas to logging and then allows the logging companies that win the concessions to decide what to log out of those areas. That is quite a change from the amount of control the Forest Service has exercised before.""\ Parker also has problems with the new law. ""It restrains the public's ability to challenge the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Service regarding their decisions on logging. And there is more opportunity to log old-growth forests.""\ Noting that top Bush appointees in this area have opposed setting aside any old-growth forests, Parker says, ""This is like letting the fox guard the henhouse.""\ But Bush gets some praise, too. Horowitz particularly likes the Clear Skies initiative that has faced opposition in Congress. This would set a cap on the emissions of the power plant pollutants that cause acid rain and then leave it to the industry to figure out how to meet that cap.\ ""I think it is a really bold and well-designed policy,"" Horowitz says.\ It departs from previous programs that tell industry what must be done to meet the standards. Horowitz and Nelson say this would lead to more innovation and efficiency.\ Horowitz also approves of the expansion of so-called ""cap and trade"" programs to more pollutants. This market-based approach limits the amount of pollutants and then allows industry to trade the rights to produce those pollutants among themselves.\ Even Bush's move to allow power plants to modernize without coming under limits on emissions from new facilities has its defenders.\ ""He's gotten a lot of flak for that, but I think what he did was pretty reasonable,"" Horowitz says. ""It makes the best of the mess that Congress handed him.""\ But Bush gets bad marks for his handling of the Environmental Protection Administration. His original head of that agency, former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, resigned when it was clear she felt sidelined.\ Her replacement, former Utah Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, also raises questions. Horowitz notes that the big issue in Utah is land use. ""But the EPA has almost no programs that deal with land use.""\ Ruth, of Maryland's Environmental Policy Program, says he is puzzled by this admistration's record. ""They have been all over the map,"" he says. ""There seems to be no coherent overarching consistent approach environmentally.""\ He is troubled by the lack of consultation with those who hold opposing viewpoints. ""They should be getting all the stakeholders around the table, but this administration seems to be captured more than others by special interests. ... I strongly feel that some of the decisions that have been made were the right ones, but maybe not for the right reasons.""\ Nelson also finds no bedrock environmental philosophy behind the Bush record. ""My overall take is that this administration tends to think running the United States is like running a giant corporation,"" he says. ""So it doesn't think in terms of political and structural reforms of basic institutions, but more like, `There's a problem over there, let's fix that problem.'""\ Crenson sees an administration focused on exploiting, not protecting, natural resources. ""Frankly, I think his record is pretty awful,"" he says.\ Parker agrees. ""I would find it very hard to find one issue where this administration could be considered pro-environment,"" he says. ""After 100 years of extraordinary progress in protecting our resources, we are where we were at the end of the 19th century, debating conservation vs. preservation. This administration is focused on utilization, the idea of selling stuff.""\ But Horowitz is more charitable. ""It's a mixed report card,"" he says. ""Bush hasn't gotten the credit he deserves for the Clear Skies Initiative, but he also hasn't gotten the type of criticism he should have for many other things.""\ Credit: SUN STAFF"
8,"This wasn't supposed to be a big year for the environmentalist movement in Annapolis, and that may yet prove to be the case. Program Open Space funds are under assault from the state Senate, millions of cap-and-trade dollars from power plants are being diverted from alternative energy and efficiency programs, and some important environmental programs have had their budgets cut (as many state government functions have).\But with just a week left in the legislative session, the greenies are in a surprisingly good position to pull off some significant wins.\Those possible victories include a measure to require homes in the critical areas near the shoreline that aren't served by public sewers to install advanced septic systems that remove more nitrogen from wastewater. That's been a highly contentious proposal in the past.\Most of Gov. Martin O'Malley's bill to commit Maryland to a 25 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 has advanced. His proposal to address the Court of Appeals' Terrapin Run decision and restore legal authority to county comprehensive plans has, too.\On the state's Smart Growth policy, however, the Senate's failure to put some teeth into the program is particularly disappointing. The House had taken Mr. O'Malley's modest effort at updating Smart Growth and required the counties to show they were making progress toward their stated goals. But that now looks like a lost cause in the Senate - and a big defeat for any hope of controlling sprawl around the Chesapeake Bay.\Still, what happens in the days ahead could make the difference. As one veteran lobbyist noted, a month ago it looked like the environmentalists were going to walk away from the session nearly empty-handed. Perhaps it's a case of looking at the Chesapeake Bay as half-clean, but given the circumstances, it's a welcome development."
9,"Washington -- Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley plunged into the rising waters of the global warming debate last week, endorsing strict regulations on greenhouse emissions that could make the state's rules among the toughest in the nation.\""The climate crisis is real,"" said O'Malley, a Democrat, throwing the weight of his office behind a plan that would cut pollutants from homes and businesses to 25 percent below 2006 levels by 2020, and 90 percent by 2050.\O'Malley and a growing number of General Assembly members want to position Maryland at the leading edge of states that are taking steps to ease global warming in the face of what they say is foot-dragging by the Bush administration and Congress.\""We all hope that there is federal action,"" said state Sen. Paul G. Pinsky, a Prince George's County Democrat and lead sponsor of the global warming measure. ""A number of presidential candidates have promised to go in that direction. But until it's done, we have to keep moving states in that direction.""\It's not unusual for Maryland's left-of-center General Assembly to debate such a plan. In recent years, lawmakers have forged ahead on embryonic stem-cell research funding, requirements to make Wal-Mart provide health insurance to employees and limits on tailpipe emissions from vehicles.\What's more notable is that O'Malley would get firmly behind the proposal. It had not been part of his legislative agenda for the 90-day Assembly session, which ends in April.\Pinsky said he was ""pleasantly and extremely surprised at the strength of the support"" that came from the governor's office last week.\Conventional wisdom holds that this should be a time of wound-licking for O'Malley. He depleted much of his political capital late last year on a long-term budget-balancing fix that included an unpopular sales tax increase, raising the ire of residents and business owners. A poll for The Sun released last month, soon after the tax-raising special legislative session ended, showed him with a 35 percent job approval rating.\That O'Malley would risk angering business interests further by endorsing an expansive greenhouse gas reduction plan illustrates just how acceptable the environmental fight has become.\""Even coming from a fairly conservative district like mine, I have yet to see how you can be too liberal on the environment,"" said state Sen. Jim Brochin, a Towson Democrat who often sides with Republicans on fiscal and regulatory issues and who is a co-sponsor of the greenhouse plan.\The Maryland proposal takes a page from California, which in 2006 adopted an initiative to reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by 2020. New Jersey, Washington and a few other states have followed.\""There is an immense amount of momentum out there, and it starts with the states,"" said Tony Kreindler, a spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund.\Democrats aren't the only ones getting behind such measures, Kreindler said, citing Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in California and Gov. Charlie Crist in Florida as state leaders in the greenhouse gas control movement.\""What's interesting about those two is they are flying high in the polls,"" he said. ""What these guys have figured out is that climate is not just good policy; it's good politics. It's a very bipartisan push.""\Maryland voters and politicians across the political spectrum have long supported path-breaking environmental initiatives, stemming from the state's reliance on and pride in the Chesapeake Bay, whose ecosystem is threatened and whose fringes are at risk of disappearing under rising seas.\As a relatively small state, Maryland alone doesn't have the same influence as California in the environmental debate. Still, ""at the end of the day, every ton of carbon avoided is a ton of carbon avoided,"" said Kreindler, noting that the evolving state-by-state effort builds pressure in Washington because influential business interests ""don't want to face a patchwork of state regulations.""\Patrick J. Michaels, a climatologist and scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, takes a dim view of the Maryland plan, calling a 90 percent reduction target ""impossible"" because technology to achieve it doesn't exist.\""People are waving legislative magic wands, as if it will create a result,"" Michaels said.\""The only way one could try to enforce that would be by making the price of carbon-based energy outrageously expensive,"" he said. ""That takes money and capital away that could actually be used to invest in cleaner technology. That's the irony.""\Any regulatory scheme, he said, must be flexible enough to allow capital to flow to sources of non-fossil-fuel energy that will inevitably develop over the next century.\The White House rejects the notion that it has not been aggressive enough on climate issues.\""The president takes climate change seriously, and is committed to a portfolio of actions that foster economic growth, achieve emissions reductions through technology investments, and include developed and developing economies,"" said Kristen A. Hellmer, a spokeswoman for the president's Council on Environmental Quality. President Bush, she added, has ""devoted more than $37 billion to climate change related programs and research, and set the U.S. on a path to reduce greenhouse gas intensity 18 percent by 2012.""\""As a former governor, he knows the positive roles state leaders must play in this effort,"" Hellmer said.\On the presidential campaign trail, climate change has figured solidly into messages by the leading candidates.\Republican Sen. John McCain stresses the role of free enterprise and carbon cap-and-trade plans. Democratic senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama both call for an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2050, a level Clinton's campaign says is ""necessary to avoid the worst impacts of global warming.""\Like McCain, both Democrats support cap-and-trade programs for carbon emissions.\Kreindler, of the Environmental Defense Fund, thinks progress need not wait for a change in administrations. ""We're not ruling it out in this Congress,"" he said.\Others take a slightly longer view.\""We are in the Stone Age right now, and whether it's Barack Obama or John McCain, we are going to come out of the Stone Age,"" Brochin said. ""You are not going to believe how bright the future is in our efforts to combat global warming.""\david.nitkin@baltsun.com\Credit: Sun reporter"
10,"The fight over the proposed buyout of a huge, Maryland-based coal mining company is interesting for its own sake. Wall Street egos, including a hedge-fund manager and would-be buyer of the Pittsburgh Steelers, are battling over control of the country's fourth-biggest coal producer.\But the contest for Linthicum Heights-based Foundation Coal, which comes to a vote Friday, sheds light beyond Wall Street and the job of extracting soft black rocks from the Appalachian ground.\It's no less than a referendum on the future of energy, the environment and the American economy. One side is bullish on China and Brazil, and seems to fear that this country is in for a long, slow slog. The other is so confident that the United States will recover, and that coal is the fuel of the future, that it's willing to pay Foundation shareholders a very handsome price.\If the United States is ""the Saudi Arabia of coal,"" as is often said, then Foundation could be Chevron, or Shell. With 1.7 billion tons of coal in its seams, the company could power Maryland's coal-burning electricity generators for more than a century. The question is whether anybody in Maryland or anywhere else will want the stuff.\Progress is catching up with coal. It spews too much junk into the air, although thanks to environmental rules, it's not as dirty as it used to be. Coal makes more greenhouse gas than other energy sources. If Congress attaches a price to carbon dioxide emissions through taxes or a cap-and-trade program, coal might not be the bargain it seems now.\The more immediate issue is when the U.S. economy will recover enough to need more coal at any price.\Electricity generation, the main use for coal, has plunged as factories and offices have gone dark. Coal consumption in the first quarter hit its lowest point since 2002, says the Energy Information Administration. Coal stockpiles have reached their highest level in more than two decades. A ton of the stuff costs less than a third of what it did a year ago.\Don't worry, says Alpha Natural Resources, a rival of Foundation's based in Abingdon, Va. It wants to buy Foundation for about $1.5 billion, an offer that has helped double Foundation's stock price since March.\Because of the kind of coal it sells, more than half of Alpha's orders last year went to Brazil and other international destinations. By absorbing Foundation, whose business is mostly domestic, Alpha becomes much more dependent on U.S. economic growth.\Alpha boss Michael Quillen trumpeted the ""diversity across geographies"" that the deal gives his company. (He said that in a news release. Observing the usual ""quiet period"" before a merger vote, neither Alpha nor any of the other primary parties returned my calls.)\Geographical diversity is not what Alpha's biggest shareholder, Duquesne Capital, wants. Not if it includes the United States.\Duquesne thinks the deal ""is against the long-term interests"" of Alpha shareholders and sees ""no upsides that can mitigate the loss of value.""\Billionaire Duquesne boss Stanley Druckenmiller learned his chops from famed currency trader George Soros and now runs his own Pittsburgh-based hedge fund. Last year, Druckenmiller flirted with buying an interest in the Steelers. Holding about 8 percent of Alpha's shares as well as investors' respect, he's making Friday's vote tough for Alpha's management.\He wants Alpha to stick with its strength of selling coal used in steelmaking - coking coal - to emerging economies as well as U.S. customers. Steel coal commands higher prices than regular coal, and customers such as Brazil, Russia and China are rapidly adding steel plants as well as coal-burning generators.\In the United States, by contrast, the economy is punk, environmental regulations will hurt coal's viability and newly available fields of natural gas will provide an economical competitor, Duquesne and Druckenmiller argue.\So there are two visions. In Alpha's, the United States quickly recovers from its crash, penalties for carbon pollution are small or nonexistent, coal remains the generation king and this country probably keeps increasing CO2 emissions.\""Coal has been the backbone of the U.S. power grid for 90 years,"" says Paul Forward, who follows Foundation and Alpha for Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore. ""We have an installed fleet of coal power plants that will take a very long time to replace under any scenarios in a shift toward lower-carbon types of power generation.""\Under Druckenmiller's bet, the American economy struggles for a long time, and environmental rules and energy conservation render generator coal increasingly uncompetitive. Meanwhile Brazil, India and China speed ahead.\Some blend of the two outcomes seems most likely. Coal-fired electricity will be around a long time, but it looks as if environment taxes will make it more expensive. Tepid U.S. growth will probably keep a lid on coal prices for years.\But I'm not the one who's voting.\Foundation and Alpha would become the third-biggest U.S. coal producer if they marry, an energy giant with $4 billion in annual sales, mines in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky and Wyoming, and a big stake in the American economy.\On Friday, their shareholders will decide whether that kind of business makes sense anymore."
11,"For a state with so much at stake environmentally - from the fragile Chesapeake Bay to communities that are vulnerable to extreme weather or sea level rise - there's been relatively little discussion of the environment in the crowded Democratic primary to challenge Gov. Larry Hogan. Perhaps that's because the Republican Mr. Hogan, while not perfect in the eyes of environmentalists, has been better on the issue than most expected, making it less fruitful as an avenue of attack. Perhaps it's because the seven major Democratic candidates largely agree on major issues related to the bay and clean energy. But whatever the case, Maryland's next governor will face important questions related to the environment, and there are some distinctions among the candidates that are worth considering.\All of them have pledged to increase the share of Maryland's electricity that is generated through renewable sources to 50 percent by 2030 at the latest. (Former Obama administration official Krish Vignarajah wants to get there by 2026.) There is general agreement on the idea that dirty sources of renewable energy, such as waste incineration, should not count. And they all believe the state should set a longer-term goal for getting to 100 percent clean energy, all of them by 2050 and one (state Sen. Richard Madaleno) as early as 2035. They all want to make Maryland a hub of clean energy manufacturing, and they all see quick adoption of offshore wind energy as crucial to that effort. And they all pledge to fight any efforts by the Trump administration to roll back the Chesapeake Bay pollution diet. But there are some differences in emphasis and unique ideas they present.\*Author/entrepreneur Alec Ross is proposing the creation of a state-wide ""green bank"" to help businesses and individuals finance clean energy projects like solar panels or geothermal heating and cooling systems. The idea is to establish a pool of funds that can help leverage private investment by covering the upfront costs of such improvements, which can be paid back through the long-term energy savings. It's worked elsewhere, including in Montgomery County.\*Neither the Maryland League of Conservation Voters nor the state chapter of the Sierra Club has made an endorsement yet, but former NAACP President and CEO Ben Jealous has gotten endorsements from 350.org, Friends of Earth Action and some big-name national environmentalists. They praise his view of environmental issues through the lens of social justice and his work in protest of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines and in support of a national cap-and-trade system.\*Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker has a strong environmental position paper developed in part by some notable Maryland environmental leaders - former Gov. Parris N. Glendening and Attorney General Brian E. Frosh - in addition to his running mate, Elizabeth Embry. Among the highlights that differ from others' plans are pushing the state to move to all LEED-certified construction by 2030 and setting a course for making Maryland a zero-waste state through expanded composting and recycling.\Two candidates' environmental proposals and records merit particular attention.\*Ms. Vignarjah has the most holistic set of policy proposals on environmental issues among the candidates. (Her level of interest is perhaps not surprising since she's married to the CEO of the National Wildlife Federation; she joked at one forum that every Democratic candidate says they love the environment, she's the only one who went so far as to marry the head of the NWF.) Some notable points in her platform include a focus on limiting additional air pollution in poor communities; steps to make vulnerable areas (like low-lying coastal regions and Ellicott City) more resilient to the effects of climate change; and restoring habitat to protect at-risk species of native wildlife.\*Mr. Madaleno may be best known in Annapolis for his budget acumen, but he also has a record of leadership on environmental issues. He has not just voted on the side of the environment but has been at the forefront of fights to establish renewable energy standards, ban fracking and stop pipeline projects, like the one now being planned to transport fracked gas under the Potomac. There is no need to wonder whether environmental protection would be a top priority for a Governor Madaleno. He's already demonstrated that it is.\Caption: Democratic gubernatorial candidates participated in an April forum sponsored by the Maryland chapter of the Sierra Club, the Maryalnd League of Conservation Voters Education Fund and Maryland Matters.\Lloyd Fox/Baltimore Sun"
12," WASHINGTON -- President Bush hiked into the snowy Adirondack Mountains to mark Earth Day two years ago by helping to restore a trail, promoting a hands-on approach to managing the nation's natural resources.\ ""There have been thousands of man hours put into this area to make it work for the good of all, and that's important for people to realize,"" Bush said. The mountains of upstate New York, he added, are ""also home to many -- a place to work, a sanctuary for visitors who come here to appreciate the peace and beauty.""\ Bush was making a point essential to his environmental stance -- that these natural resources should be enjoyed, not locked away. But his critics say that it is not hikers and vacationers his administration is inviting into the woods, it is timber, mining and oil companies eager to extract profits from public land.\ Despite conservationists' strong feelings about Bush's record, environmental concerns have been all but invisible in the presidential campaign, elbowed aside by Iraq and terrorism.\ The issue breaks overwhelmingly in Kerry's favor. A recent USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll, for example, showed voters preferred Kerry to Bush by 29 points on environmental issues.\ The complaints about Bush go back to the first days of his administration when he pulled out of the Kyoto protocols on global warming and his vice president, Dick Cheney, refused to divulge the names of the people he consulted in writing an energy policy.\ Conservationists say Bush's pattern is to grandstand with nicely named proposals. Some they denounce, like the Healthy Forests Initiative that gave timber companies more control over public land as a firefighting measure; some that are controversial, like the Clear Skies Initiative that allows energy companies to trade pollution credits instead of reducing emissions at older power plants; and some they approve of, like restricting pollution from off-road diesel engines.\ But in the background, those critics charge, Bush is filling many key environmental posts with former energy industry officials who are re-writing the arcane details of environmental regulations. The critics paint the president as a former oil man beholden to the energy producers who bankrolled his campaigns, willing to let industry plunder resources for profit.\ ""President Bush has attacked virtually every major environmental law,"" said Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, ""in a way that will set this country back 25 years.""\ Jim Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality and the president's chief environmental adviser, said that charges that he is too cozy with polluting industries and writing policies on their behalf are blatantly false.\ ""You've got these groups complaining about what others are asking us to do, and impugning their ideas to us,"" Connaughton said. ""It's `we fear they'll do something terrible.' Then when we come out with the policy, you don't hear another word. Where does the complaining go?""\ If there is one area on which Bush and Kerry differ most starkly, it is on the question of whether to open more public land to energy exploration. In less than four years, the White House has made millions of acres of federal land available to logging, drilling or mining. Bush says he is keeping his pledge to boost domestic energy supplies.\ While Kerry's proposals are vague -- intentionally, so as not to lose voters in swing states such as West Virginia, where coal is an important economic issue -- the senator has vowed to clamp down on energy leases. Kerry says he would place royalties from drilling leases in a trust, to help fund research into cleaner energy.\ But some analysts say despite harsh campaign rhetoric, the Bush White House and a Kerry White House would not differ dramatically in environmental management.\ ""Replacing the president would not initiate some Valhalla -- it would not be this new paradise for the environmental community,"" said George Gonzalez, a University of Miami political scientist who specializes in environmental policy.\ According to Gonzalez, environmental groups have been justified in spewing venom over many of Bush's policy proposals. But, some of the ideas Bush has offered, he said, have been more about political showmanship that real policy change. To mobilize voters in Republican-leaning states, especially out West, he said, Bush must play up the ""urban/rural divide"" in environmental policy and offer symbolic gestures.\ ""He needs support from people who are suspicious of environmentalists,"" said Gonzalez, ""and who see an urban elite who wants to tie up resources out West fighting against rural folks who live off the open land and just want to take advantage of their resources.""\ But Democrats are mindful that many voters -- especially women and suburban voters in the Northeast -- care deeply about environmental issues and can be swayed by talk of how Bush's policies endanger natural resources and human health. So they pull out their own symbols, most notably the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska that Bush wants opened to oil exploration and Kerry wants to see protected. Though the argument is heated, many analysts agree that the huge wilderness would not be tremendously affected by the drilling, and that the amount of oil that could be extracted from ANWR would have little effect on the country's energy thirst.\ Still, Kerry and Bush have contrasting philosophies that are worth debating. The president leans away from regulation and places more trust in industry to invest in ways to clean the environment when it is provided the right incentives. Kerry, on the other hand, maintains a belief in the role of regulatory enforcement.\ As usual at this point in the political cycle, the energy generated by the partisan argument casts more heat than light on the issue.\ ""Environmentalists will try to portray the Republicans and the president as not caring about the environment and only caring about their petroleum company buddies,"" said Paul Portney, president of Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan think tank.\ ""Meanwhile, the Republicans make it seem like John Kerry believes that in order to save a single tree or snail, he would make us dependent on natural gas and oil from countries that are unstable and unfriendly,"" Portney said. ""It is just very hard for environmentalists to ever accept what Republicans do, or for Republicans to ever say `Hey, this makes sense and it's good for the environment,' if it comes from a Democrat.""\ GENERAL APPROACH\ GEORGE BUSH: Wants to shift environmental protection away from what he sees as a heavy focus on regulation and enforcement to a market approach that sets standards and rewards companies that meet them. Believes government crackdowns on polluting industries and energy-development restrictions on some public lands hurt the economy.\ prospered as the government enforced environmental laws. Bush has failed to back lofty rhetoric about conservation with effective policies, focusing too much on granting flexibility to polluting industries and opening federal land for energy exploration.\ GENERAL APPROACH\ JOHN KERRY: Backs firm enforcement of environmental laws, while insisting that business interests are not unduly constrained by regulation.\ lead to expensive legal battles that do not really protect resources or human health.\ AIR POLLUTION\ GEORGE BUSH: Promotes what he calls a oClear Skieso initiative aimed at reducing power plant pollution by 70 percent by 2018. While the plan sets mandatory emission limits, industries would be given wide flexibility on how they meet them under a ocap-and-tradeo system that would allow companies whose pollution exceeds legal limits to buy ocreditso from cleaner plants elsewhere. Loosened a rule called onew source review,o which required companies to install modern pollution equipment when they upgrade older power plants. Implemented new regulations on diesel emissions.\ Criticism: oClear Skieso relies on power plants to self-regulate and does not force them to do so. Cap-and-trade allows plants to continue polluting to the detriment of nearby communities. The proposed 70 percent reduction in mercury emissions is not aggressive enough to curb a toxin that affects the health of people and wildlife.\ to onew source review.o Would cut mercury emissions from power plants by 90 ocap-andtradeo system, but wants to set an aggressive timetable for plants to meet standards, give wider enforcement powers to regulators and restrict pollution in national parks and recreation areas.\ Criticism: Would force utilities to turn away from coal and increase use of natural gas. Consumers would see electricity prices soar. Manufacturers that rely on cheap electricity, especially in cities, would have to cut jobs.\ ENERGY\ GEORGE BUSH: Vowed to reduce dependence on foreign oil by increasing petroleum exploration on some federal land. Has encouraged energy companies to explore for oil and gas on lands previously leased from the federal government Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Backs expanded mountaintop coal mining in West Virginia and elsewhere. Began a Hydrogen Fuel Initiative aimed at having hydrogen fuel cell cars on the market by 2020. Supports tax credits for use of renewable forms of energy.\ Criticism: Policies to open millions of acres to oil drilling and mining would help political supporters in the energy industry at the expense of natural areas. Funding plan he has offered for cleaner energy is insufficient.\ JOHN KERRY: Opposes oil exploration in Arctic refuge. Would require expanded study of environmental impacts of oil drilling on public land and stiffen requirement that industry restore public land after drilling or mining. Supports having 20 percent of electricity come from renewable energy sources, and 20 percent of fuel come from domestic alternative sources, by 2020. Supports creating a new trust fund to pay for use of alternative fuels.\ Criticism: Effort to limit energy exploration on public lands would deepen dependence on foreign energy, hurt the economy, force utilities to turn from coal to natural gas and raise electricity prices. Aggressive goals for expanding renewable and alternative energy sources impossible to meet without soaring prices.\ GLOBAL WARMING\ GEORGE BUSH: Disavowed Kyoto Protocol, a treaty by industrialized countries to dramatically reduce pollution that contributes to global warming. Argues that Kyoto placed an unfair burden on the United States and would damage its economy. Increased funding for climate research, claiming that science pointing to human-induced climate change is inconclusive. Supports tax incentives to encourage use of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles and forms of renewable energy that do not emit greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming.\ Criticism: Bush has ignored solid scientific findings showing industrial link to climate change. Abandonment of Kyoto was an embarrassment for the United States and set back global efforts to confront global warming. Widespread use of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles is still years away.\ JOHN KERRY: Sees economic disadvantages for U.S. in Kyoto treaty, but insists White House take the lead in crafting a new binding global climate unacceptable.o Supports new funding for renewable forms of energy and more research into climate change.\ Criticism: Entering a new, binding climate treaty would impose excessive burdens on U.S. industries, lose jobs and damage the economy. Has missed important votes in the Senate on funding renewable energy sources.\ Credit: SUN NATIONAL STAFF"

A special part of home ownership is the idea that you own the place, and it's yours to do with as you wish. Now's your chance to have that bright pink house you've always dreamed about or the opportunity to build that smoker out back, so you're ready to go once you bag that buck next deer season. Well, hold on there buckaroo, because there are lots of rules and regulations - many that you might not be aware of - that could put some serious limitations on how you personalize the old homestead. You may think you're king or queen of the castle, but you aren't entirely the master of your domain.
\
Unless you own a house that's 300 miles from the nearest Wal-Mart, you're probably going to encounter some sort of private or public regulation that will govern certain aspects of how you use or modify your home. Especially in our local urban environment, there probably isn't a house around that doesn't fall under some restriction associated with zoning laws, condo and homeowner's association rules, state and local guidelines or even federal laws. In this column, we'll take a look at a few of these controlling entities and how they might constrain your creativity in the way you live or what you do with your house.
\
Condos and homeowner's associations
\
Many homes, whether they be a detached dwelling, townhouses or some other configuration are subject to a self-imposed set of association rules and regulations. If you purchased a house in one of these communities, you most likely had an opportunity before settlement to get a copy of those regulations and decide if they're something you can live with. In a contract of sale, there are special addendums that address properties within a condo or homeowner's associations. These require that the buyer be given a chance to review the association rules, and if you don't like what's in there you can get out of the contract.

Sometimes the association rules are pretty simple and straightforward; other times, they might look like a copy of War and Peace and contain numerous regulations that control very specific aspects of how you use or change your property. For example, let's say you're Joe the plumber, and you've got one of those white panel vans topped with a bunch of copper tubing and PVC piping. Some associations prohibit work vehicles from being parked in the community. So unless you can leave that truck back at the shop, you don't want to buy a house in that neighborhood. The same can be true with things like boats, campers and a whole host of other stuff you might want to put in your driveway. Plus, the problem might not be something as big as a camper. Perhaps you need that two foot satellite dish to get the Sunday sports package that makes life worth living. Well, even that might create an issue with the association rules.
\
So if you buy a house that has a condo or homeowner's association, take the time to read the rules, and think hard about whether or not they contain something that's going to limit your lifestyle. Getting those rules changed is like amending the United States Constitution. It's not an easy thing to do. Don't bet on getting a pass down the road or thinking you'll get away with a violation, just because the guy next door says it's not a problem. You don't want your dream house to turn into a nightmare when the Direct TV guy starts bolting that dish to the back of your deck. You can put some potted plants around it, but trust us, the association board of directors will find you out.
\
State and local laws
\
Even if you aren't in a condo or homeowner's association, zoning laws create a number of limitations with regard to exactly what you can or can't do with a private residence. Most of us are aware of the obvious ones. We all know that in a residential zone, you can't open a hot dog stand in your front yard or turn extra bedrooms into some kind of Motel 6. But there can often be some lesser known regulations that might affect you. And, unlike condo and homeowner's associations, when you buy the place, your contract of sale might not always disclose these potential restrictions.
\
Until not too long ago, there wasn't anything in the contract of sale that notified people about the very restrictive regulations for homes in the Annapolis Historic District. Now, there is a notice that informs buyers of this and points them to where they can get more information. But there are other zoning restrictions that most buyers and some real estate agents might not always know exist. In Eastport, they have something called the Eastport overlay. This is a set of local zoning laws developed specifically for that area. It's not as restrictive as the Historic District, but in an attempt to maintain the unique character of Eastport, it does contain a number of rules that require approval for changes or additions to your home. Other communities can also have similar legislation. So be sure to ask about it, and go directly to the source - places like the Department of Planning and Zoning. Your real estate agent might not be aware of every one of these laws, and you shouldn't rely on their interpretation of what the laws mean.
\
Another big area where state and local laws can come into play is with respect to waterfront homes. There are all kinds of laws that dictate what you can and can't do with property located at the water's edge. Don't get out there with your chain saw, trying to improve your view, or you could find yourself in a heap of trouble. With ever-increasing environmental regulations, these laws are constantly changing, and what the government defines as ""critical areas"" can be much different from what you previously understood them to be. Even if there's not a drop of water in sight, you might come up against government regulations because your property is in or adjacent to a forest conservation area. Again, be sure you understand what this means in how it might impact the use and enjoyment of your land.
\
Federal regulations
\
To date, federal regulations haven't had all that much influence on what someone can do with their home. For the most part, the feds have left that up to state and local government. But that may all be about to change. Currently working its way through Congress is something called ""The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009."" It's more commonly known as cap and trade. In an effort to save the planet, this bill contains a number of provisions that would directly affect real estate. For the first time, it would create a federal building code to enforce national standards on energy efficiency. In its original form, the bill even went so far as to require energy audits of private homes and make them part of that property's public record. In a place like Annapolis, where you have many older historic homes, this could have created a serious, and perhaps unfair, devaluation of those homes, in that they tend to be less energy efficient. So keep an eye on cap and trade. If you think it's just about power plants and controlling heavy industry, you're wrong. In its ever expanding 1,500 pages, it's looking to reach right into your own backyard.

"
14,"Gov. Chris Christie says he pulled New Jersey out of the multistate Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative because the pact's carbon-emission permits cost the state too much.\Paying for the allowances, he told reporters a few days ago, ""does nothing more than tax electricity. Tax our citizens. Tax our businesses. With no discernible or measurable impact on the environment.""\The other problem, Christie said, is that the carbon-emission permits cost the state too little.\""RGGI allowances were never expensive enough to change behavior, as they were intended to, and ultimately fuel different choices,"" he said at the same news conference - and, practically, in the same breath.\Now you know why Christie is deemed presidential. A lesser politician might have let logic get between him and the TV cameras.\Of course, RGGI's merits or demerits aren't the primary concern. The main thing for Christie was to pass a Republican initiation rite by trashing a scheme now portrayed by some conservatives as a liberal plot. (It was Republican George Pataki who conceived the broad outlines of RGGI as governor of New York in 2003.)\If Christie supports cutting carbon emissions, as he claims he does, he would have kept New Jersey in RGGI and continued using some of the revenues to subsidize conservation and alternative energy, as Maryland does.\On Wednesday, RGGI (pronounced ""Reggie"" by the cognoscenti) will hold another quarterly auction and mark its third full year of selling emissions allowances to power companies.\Electricity plants will bid for the right to emit carbon dioxide based on limits, set by the 10 member states, that grow more stringent year by year. Generators pass along the permits' cost in the wholesale market, if they can, to customers of Baltimore Gas & Electric and other Northeast power consumers.\The idea is to raise the cost of carbon emissions to a level that better reflects the harm they inflict on the environment, to create incentives to steer power generators and consumers toward low-carbon energy, and to produce revenue to help make that cleaner power more accessible. The program was inspired by the highly successful cap-and-trade program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions and acid rain that was signed into law in 1990 by (Republican) President George H.W. Bush.\It's true that RGGI allowances are a kind of environmental tax on electricity consumers. But so is any switch to any fuel cleaner and more expensive than coal, the gold standard for cheap, dirty kilowatts. The expensive, offshore-wind generation that Christie supports will cost New Jerseyites a heck of a lot more than the RGGI charge ever did.\Many prominent economists, among them N. Gregory Mankiw, the (Republican) former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under (Republican) President George W. Bush, believe the government should simply tax carbon emissions directly. (Mankiw favors simultaneously cutting other taxes.)\RGGI allowances cost the typical BGE household less than $2 a month, the utility has calculated.\While Christie's right to say that kind of cost isn't enough to change energy-consumption behavior, attaching a small price tag to carbon is better than no price tag.\Thanks to the poor economy and cheaper natural gas, carbon dioxide emissions have fallen in the RGGI corridor, which stretches from Maryland to Maine. Given states' generous emissions caps, that makes CO(-2) permits - even for coal stations such as Constellation Energy's Brandon Shores and C.P. Crane plants in Maryland - plentiful and cheap.\But not meaningless.\RGGI has generated more than $160 million in revenue for Maryland in less than three years. Unfortunately, most of it is spent on cutting electricity rates, especially for low-income households, even as electricity prices have been falling. Rather than making a tiny difference in kilowatt prices, the state should spend all the money on subsidizing solar-energy installations, electric-vehicle stations, conservation and the like.\Even so, what revenue has been invested has helped increase the infrastructure of solar-panel installers, insulation companies and conservation experts that the state will need to slow the increase in greenhouse-gas emissions.\This kind of decentralized response is part of what makes RGGI attractive. Set up incentives linked to carbon prices, and let individual producers and consumers choose options that make sense for them.\Instead, Christie supports the Soviet-style option of building a huge complex of wind pylons several miles off New Jersey's shore. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley favors a similar project in this state. But O'Malley backs RGGI and criticized Christie for withdrawing, saying ""Governor Christie is simply wrong when he claims that these efforts are a failure.""\Of course, RGGI is not a screaming success, either. The carbon caps aren't tight enough. The allowance market is weak. RGGI has not inspired Congress to impose a similar system nationally.\And Christie is right about one thing: RGGI has had ""no discernible or measurable effect on the environment.""\But if that's the standard for success, we should do nothing. Heightened carbon dioxide levels are the product of decades. They will take decades or centuries to undo. Better to move forward than back.\jay.hancock@baltsun.com"
15,"WASHINGTON - The Obama administration plans to push ahead with plans to aggressively limit greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming despite fears that the move could further slow the recessionary economy.\Instead of backing away, the administration plans to portray the limits as a boost for America's ""clean energy economy,"" according to congressional leaders and energy experts who have talked with top Obama advisers. The move would spur competitiveness and promote investment in renewable alternatives to imported oil, the government will argue.\At issue is the ""cap and trade"" initiative, under which the government would set limits on carbon emissions by power plants, factories and other installations but allow those who emit more to buy or trade permits with companies and facilities that emitted less than the prescribed limit.\The idea is that raising the cost of pumping more carbon into the atmosphere would encourage companies and other emitters to cut back, thus reducing a principal cause of global warming.\""If we don't put a price on carbon,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, ""we'll never get these clean energy sources online.""\But cap-and-trade would amount to a tax, raising energy costs. And several independent studies have suggested that emissions limits could be a drag on economic growth, a concern raised frequently by opponents of climate change legislation.\""The whole economic issue will be front and center in the debate on this, on both sides,"" said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, who has discussed Obama's global warming plans with senior administration officials.\Polls show voters increasingly losing interest in the global warming issue.\By pressing ahead anyway, Obama would be sticking with a program he said during the campaign would be a high priority of his presidency.\""There's a general consensus that things are going to be done with climate"" in Washington this year, said Daniel Yergin, the author of the Pulitzer-winning The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power, who recently updated his book with an epilogue on Obama and energy. He added: ""We're going to go through a very intense national seminar on cap and trade and carbon tax.""\Details of the administration's approach are far from set, though Obama has repeatedly said he favors ""cap and trade,"" allowing companies to buy and sell emissions permits. The administration will argue that greenhouse gas restrictions should be part of a two-pronged effort to stimulate renewable energy supplies and ensure demand for the megawatts they'd produce.\The first part is to invest heavily in wind power, solar power and biofuels, through the massive stimulus bill working its way through Congress. The second is to help that power compete with cheaper fossil fuels by pumping up their costs to reflect the potential economic damage from a warmed earth.\Critics, including many Republicans on Capitol Hill, say those moves will only increase energy prices and hurt already struggling families.\""I just have concerns on the impact on the economy with all of the issues of global climate change,"" said Sen. John A. Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who sits on the Senate's energy and environment committees, ""and what restrictions there's going to be, what expenses there's going to be for American taxpayers.""\Economists generally agree that limiting emissions is likely to curb economic growth, at least in the short term.\Peter Orszag, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office who now heads the White House Office of Management and Budget, told Congress last year that emissions limits would reduce long-term economic risks but ""also impose costs on the economy ... in the form of higher prices for energy and energy-intensive goods.""\Orszag also testified that the size of those costs could depend on whether the government sells emissions permits and if so, how it spends the proceeds. Environmentalists have recently pushed that idea one step further, arguing that if Congress passed emissions caps today, it could borrow against the future revenues from permit sales and spend the money on alternative energy research and technology.\That would stimulate the economy and ""allow polluters to transition from a high-polluting environment to a low-polluting environment,"" said Andy Stevenson, a former hedge fund manager who is now a finance adviser for the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.\Other experts are more skeptical. Subsidizing alternative energy could stimulate the economy, said Robert Shapiro, an economic adviser to President Bill Clinton who now chairs the U.S. Climate Task Force. But a cap-and-trade system, he said, ""would raise energy prices, at a time when you're trying to increase consumption. ... It goes against everything [Obama] campaigned on.""\Shapiro and many economists would prefer for the government to tax carbon emissions and refund the proceeds straight to taxpayers. The Democratic leaders working with Obama on climate legislation prefer cap-and-trade. So do a coalition of business leaders, including Shell Oil and the Big Three automakers, who joined with some environmental groups to release an emissions-limit proposal this month.\Boxer said Friday that she's learned from the defeat of a cap-and-trade bill in the Senate last year. She's set to unveil basic principles of a simpler, more focused plan next week, in hopes of passing a bill by year's end.\Her counterpart on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat, talks even more optimistically: He has promised a bill by Memorial Day.\Credit: Tribune Washington Bureau"
16,"This two-part commentary from Bay Journal News Service presents the views of the Republican and Democratic candidates for president on their policies regarding the Chesapeake Bay region.\To appreciate the impact of a McCain administration on the health of the Chesapeake Bay, one needs to understand the strong stewardship ethic that guides Sen. John McCain's policy decisions.\Mr. McCain cites three strong influences that shape his approach to protecting the environment.\The first is his personal hero, Theodore Roosevelt. Mr. McCain is a true expert on Roosevelt and his conservation legacy. He has said that he would appoint environmental officials who reflect a conservation ethic reminiscent of great conservation champions such as Roosevelt.\The second is Morris K. Udall, a Democratic congressman who is revered as one of our nation's greatest environmental champions and was a close friend of Mr. McCain's. The two teamed up to protect more than 3 million acres of wilderness in their home state of Arizona.\The third is the Grand Canyon, which Mr. McCain says is ""a special, sacred place whose timeless beauty moves me."" He refers to it as a ""monumental inspiration regarding our obligation to be faithful stewards.""\Mr. McCain has made it his mission to advocate policies that protect the interests of future generations and ensure that they will inherit ""the blessings of a rich, productive and unspoiled natural heritage."" He has also said that improving the management of our nation's wetlands, fisheries and ocean ecosystems would be one of his top priorities as president.\Mr. McCain is not only a dedicated steward of our environment, he is also a steward of taxpayer dollars. Critical natural resources such as the Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes and the Everglades stand to benefit greatly from Mr. McCain's efforts to rein in unnecessary, and often environmentally destructive, pork-barrel spending and require independent review of water projects. This would mean that important water resource dollars being wasted on special-interest-driven pet projects can be available for efforts that are clear national priorities, such as Chesapeake Bay restoration.\Another hallmark of Mr. McCain's approach to environmental policy is his commitment to making decisions based on sound science and facts, not on special-interest politics. Mr. McCain's fight against the influence of special interests and his dedication to government transparency and accountability would be a great plus for efforts to safeguard our environment.\The bay, like other marine environments, is coming under increasing pressure from the impacts of climate change. Addressing climate change and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels are important to the future health of the bay.\Mr. McCain is one of the lead authors of the bipartisan Climate Stewardship Act, a cap-and-trade bill that, if passed, would reduce greenhouse gas emissions 67 percent by 2050. Mr. McCain used the political capital necessary to secure votes on the bill in the face of opposition by his own party members.\To build support for climate legislation, Mr. McCain undertook an intensive effort to educate his colleagues in the Senate and the House about climate change and mankind's role. He has taken skeptical senators and representatives to the ends of the Earth, including Antarctica, Alaska, Greenland and New Zealand, to show them the impacts of global warming and change their minds on this issue. Mr. McCain's long record of dedication to fighting climate change and his bipartisan approach offer the best opportunity for signing long-overdue climate legislation into law.\People who care about the health of the bay and its fisheries should also be excited about Mr. McCain's choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate. No state in the union does a better job of protecting its marine fisheries than her home state. Alaska's program is the example ocean advocates point to as the best model of fishery management.\Mrs. Palin, herself a commercial and sport fisherman, has made fishery protection a priority. She developed a rigorous enforcement protocol to ensure that cruise ships, which are like small cities in their environmental footprint, obey a state law prohibiting the dumping of waste in state waters.\You can be sure that a McCain-Palin administration would have the stewardship ethic and the experience to be a strong and effective advocate for the Chesapeake Bay and the people who depend on it.\David Jenkins, government affairs director for Republicans for Environmental Protection, serves as national coordinator of the Environmental Stewardship Coalition for McCain-Palin 2008."
17," Maryland joined a multistate effort to reduce pollution contributing to global warming yesterday and will begin studies to find more ways to combat climate change and limit the threat rising sea levels pose to the state's 3,100 miles of shoreline.\ Gov. Martin O'Malley, who signed on to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and issued an executive order creating the Maryland Commission on Climate Change yesterday at Sandy Point Park on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, said that in the absence of federal action to combat global warming, states must step up their efforts.\ When fully phased in, RGGI will force a 10 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 10 Northeastern states, and O'Malley said that given the magnitude of the threat posed by global warming, that agreement must be only a starting point for Maryland.\ ""This is a real threat,"" he said. ""Our children are very likely going to find the things we take for granted, the blue crab or the Baltimore oriole or even some of our islands, the very things that make us who we are, will be gone forever.""\ Maryland's participation in the RGGI agreement was mandated by the Clean Air Act, which the legislature passed and former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. signed last year. Previously, Ehrlich had opposed the state's participation in the compact, saying it could decrease the reliability of the electric grid and drive up prices for consumers.\ Shari T. Wilson, secretary of the Department of the Environment, said an economic impact study required by the Clean Air Act found that the agreement could reduce utility bills by establishing conservation programs.\ ""That should be a benefit to consumers as well as address global warming,"" she said.\ Matthias Ruth, director of the University of Maryland Center for Integrative Environmental Research, who conducted the study, said the agreement will provide moderate environmental benefits and with little economic cost - and possibly economic gains from energy efficiency.\ ""Signing it has fairly modest direct impacts, but it is a major step forward nationally, and it will set the tone for the discussions on climate change, which I have no doubt will make a major difference,"" Ruth said.\ The RGGI agreement creates the first ""cap and trade"" system in the United States to control emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary global warming gas. Starting in 2009, each state will be allocated a certain amount of carbon dioxide its power plants are allowed to emit (for Maryland, it's 37,503,983 million short tons a year). The states would then auction off the credits to electricity producers, who would be forced to stay below the caps or buy unused credits from cleaner power plants.\ Beginning in 2015, the states' caps will be reduced by 2.5 percent a year for four years.\ An economic analysis conducted by RGGI member states estimated that the cap and trade program could increase retail consumers electric bills by 0.3 percent to 3.2 percent in 2015, a difference of between $3 and $16 a year.\ George S. Aburn Jr., air director for the state Department of the Environment, said the program could generate as much as $100 million a year for energy efficiency programs, such as installing ""smart meters"" in homes to help customers manage their power use or establishing incentive programs for people to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\ ""The smartest and easiest way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is to reduce demand,"" Aburn said.\ Constellation Energy, the largest power producer in Maryland, has been involved in the development of RGGI and ""looks forward to working with Maryland officials"" to implement it, said company spokesman Robert L. Gould.\ ""Constellation ... would like to see it serve as a steppingstone to a uniform and comprehensive national program,"" Gould said.\ Environmentalists stood with O'Malley yesterday to praise his efforts on global warming, and they encouraged him to go beyond the requirements of RGGI.\ ""Some governors are sitting back and waiting for others to take action, and others are stepping forward and exercising leadership,"" said Brad Heavner, director of Environment Maryland, a nonprofit advocacy group. ""I'm glad the governor of Maryland is showing leadership.""\ In the year since the Clean Air Act passed, the scientific consensus about the existence and dangers of global warming has become much stronger, said Sen. Paul G. Pinsky, a Prince George's Democrat who sponsored the act.\ He said the state now needs to move toward an overall carbon emissions cap to cover pollution sources other than power plants, an idea he pursued unsuccessfully in this year's General Assembly session. ""That clearly is the next step,"" he said. ""It's going to affect our lives ... how we travel, where we go, what we do, but we have to act.""\ California and New Jersey have taken steps to limit and reduce total carbon emissions, and Maryland needs to do the same, Pinsky said.\ Such a cap is one of the things the governor's climate change task force will be charged with studying. O'Malley said the commission will assess the impact of climate change on Maryland, develop strategies to reduce carbon emissions and find ways to reduce the state's vulnerability to rising sea levels.\ Wilson, the environment secretary, said Maryland's geography with the bay and the many rivers that feed it makes it the third-most vulnerable state to rising sea levels, behind Louisiana and Florida. Sea levels in the state have risen by a foot in the past 100 years, she said.\ Joshua Tulkin, the organizing director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said the commission needs to act fast. He and others said they hope it makes recommendations in time for the General Assembly to take up a carbon cap in next year's legislative session.\ ""A study is important, but essentially we know were we need to go already,"" Tulkin said. ""We need a statewide carbon cap, and the faster we get there, the better.""\ O'Malley said Marylanders will need to take difficult steps to protect the environment for the next generation, but that the task, while daunting, is not insurmountable.\ ""At the end of the day, one of the most hopeful comforts we have in facing this challenge is this truth: As our problems are man- made, so are the solutions,"" he said. ""We have a need but of will.""\ andy.green@baltsun.com\ The initiative\ Gov.

18,"The state Commission on Climate Change is urging comprehensive action to reduce air pollution, get ready for a warming climate and prepare for rising water along Maryland's vulnerable coastline.\In a report to be released today, the panel urges Gov. Martin O'Malley to seek legislative and policy changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Maryland by 10 percent by 2012, and 90 percent by 2050.\The report's 42 recommendations include tighter restrictions on coastline development, new standards for power generation, and stricter building codes and land-use planning.\""The exciting part of the commission's work here is that this is very doable,"" said Maryland Environment Secretary Shari T. Wilson, who chaired the panel. ""For the first time, it quantifies the emissions-reductions benefits of a variety of options and lays out a road map we can take, whether as an individual consumer or as a state government.""\An administration-backed bill that would have committed the state to the 90 percent cut in emissions failed this year in Annapolis. Manufacturers and labor unions warned that it could drive industry from Maryland and cost jobs.\The commission said climate-related legislation that did pass is expected to get the state more than halfway to the 2020 goal of a 25 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2006 levels. Adoption of its plan, the panel said, could ""easily"" achieve that 25 percent cut.\O'Malley, in a statement from the Democratic National Convention in Denver, thanked the commission but did not offer any immediate agenda for implementing its recommendations.\""I look forward to carefully reviewing the report, and working with all stakeholders to develop both short- and long-term strategies to address climate change,"" he said.\Brad Heavner, state director of Environment Maryland, who served on a commission working group, called the recommendations ""a good plan for taking us to the future.""\The report shows ""that aggressive pollution targets are possible and good for the state, not only environmentally, but economically,"" he said. ""We can get it done this year.""\Critics said that proposals to cut carbon emissions don't point out the costs of reaching those goals, and could have painful economic consequences for Maryland manufacturers and labor.\""Maryland is less than three-tenths of 1 percent of the U.S. emissions, and the U.S. is not even the largest country in terms of greenhouse gas emissions anymore,"" said Michael C. Powell, a lawyer and lobbyist representing manufacturers on the issue. ""We believe these issues should be addressed on a national level.""\The commission said the biggest emissions reductions would come from increased use of renewable energy, cleaner electrical generation, tougher energy efficiency standards and a cap-and-trade plan that would allow some industries to purchase pollution ""credits.""\Society has incurred ""considerable costs,"" the panel argues, from past decisions that were ""not in sync with past and present climate conditions, ... These costs are likely to increase as climate change accelerates."" The benefits of warming temperatures are fleeting, the commission said, while ""the costs of inaction are likely to stay and increase.""\The commission includes 22 Cabinet secretaries, agency heads and mostly Democratic lawmakers. Their scientific working group warned this month that Maryland should expect a 3-degree rise in average annual temperatures by mid-century, or a 9-degree jump in summer temperatures by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed. Sea levels could rise another 1 to 3 feet in this century.\The fastest and cheapest way to cut greenhouse gas emissions would be through energy efficiency and the development of a ""clean energy industry,"" the commission concluded. ""By lagging behind other states that are already investing in the fast-growing clean energy industry, Maryland is missing out on huge economic development and growth potential,"" the commission found.\""It sounds as though this is forward-thinking; it's aggressive and particularly appropriate for a state as vulnerable to climate change as Maryland,"" said Cindy Schwartz, executive director of the League of Conservation Voters.\The commission also called for new ""smart growth"" strategies, and revisions to building codes and design standards to reduce coastal development and protect it against damage.\""Two to three feet of sea-level rise would inundate thousands of properties in low-lying areas and expose millions of dollars worth of public infrastructure to the threat of submergence and/or storm surge,"" the report states. ""Over time, state and local government will not be able to afford to assist all in need - the costs will just be too high.""\For the full report, go to www.mde.state.md.us/Air/climatechange/in dex.asp.\Credit: frank.roylance@baltsun.com"
19,"From the start, Maryland's participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has been an unmitigated success. The multistate cap-and-trade compact has substantially reduced greenhouse gas emissions from power plants while reducing average utility bills and investing more than $1.3 billion in clean energy and conservation initiatives that have created at least 14,000 new jobs.\The question now before Maryland and the eight other northeastern states that have been a part of RGGI for most of the last decade is this: Should the voluntary arrangement be extended past 2020 and, if so, what should be its goals? Massachusetts supports raising the standard from a 2.5 percent reduction in emissions each year to 5 percent - a target Gov. Larry Hogan's administration has said might be too ambitious for Maryland to remain involved.\Maryland Department of the Environment Secretary Ben Grumbles insists that the state remains committed to cleaner air but worries about unintended consequences. Delaware may be facing a similar choice if the more stringent goal puts the state at a competitive disadvantage without necessarily producing cleaner air. Both states draw a greater percentage of their electricity from coal-fired power plants than do New England states. A full withdrawal from RGGI is a scenario that Mr. Grumbles believes to be unlikely but can't rule out.\But while Secretary Grumbles has spoken approvingly of RGGI before (telling The Sun's editorial board last year that it's been ""smart"" and ""useful""), it's not clear exactly what (or who) will drive the state's position. Governor Hogan's decision earlier this year to veto a popular emissions-related bill approved by the General Assembly has already cast doubt about the administration's commitment to improving air quality and fighting climate change.\The legislation, the Clean Energy Jobs Act, would have raised Maryland's clean energy goal from 20 percent to 25 percent, a target that seemed entirely reasonable given the state's long-term quest to reach 40 percent carbon reductions by 2030. The governor's reasoning? It could prove costly to ratepayers.\But how the cost issue would play out is not exactly clear. A decade ago, RGGI opponents made the same claim with the same logic - cleaner air means higher electricity rates. But it didn't work out that way. A 2015 study found that people living in RGGI states actually ended up paying less for power than people living elsewhere while the proceeds from RGGI auctions fueled investments that saved business and residential customers money, too.\So what would the Clean Energy Jobs Act have cost? Estimates run all over the place, but an analysis conducted by the Department of Legislative Services projects average monthly bills rising by an average of $1-$2 in future years (and perhaps by much less). And even that estimate fails to take into account the health savings produced by cleaner air - no small consideration in a state with failing air pollution grades from the American Lung Association and one that is burdened with the fifth-worst adult asthma in the nation.\There's also a matter of opportunity cost. As the United States and other countries move toward lowering carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, states that act sooner rather than later will be rewarded with clean energy jobs. Large companies like Ikea, Staples, Gap and North Face are already lobbying for the tougher RGGI standards because they see long-term benefits to the economy and consumer spending.\But here's where the Hogan administration may have some legitimate concern: Neighboring states like Pennsylvania aren't part of RGGI. While they, too, will presumably have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants under the EPA's Clean Power Plan (which was put on a temporary hold earlier this year by the Supreme Court prior to Antonin Scalia's death), Maryland ratepayers might find themselves cursed twice - paying more for cleaner power but still suffering downwind power plant pollution. The only difference would be that the electricity from those same coal-fired power plants will be consumed in places like Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh instead of Baltimore, Annapolis or Rockville.\The answer? Get more states to join RGGI and elect a president who supports the Clean Power Plan. (Hint: Donald J. Trump doesn't.) That would surely be a welcome development, but RGGI members may still need to allow for the circumstances of states located in differing power grids. Polls show most Marylanders are willing to pay more for electricity in exchange for cleaner air, but paying more for electricity and getting no environmental benefit in return? That would be a problem."
20," Seven Northeastern states agreed yesterday to take steps to limit pollutants that cause global warming, but Maryland officials declined, saying they wanted to avoid hurting power plants or raising electricity rates.\ The governors of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont signed an agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants 10 percent by 2019.\ In the face of federal inaction, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is the first attempt by a coalition of U.S. states to tackle the problem of global warming, which many scientists say is melting polar ice caps and causing rising sea levels.\ Massachusetts and Rhode Island dropped out of the group at the last minute, with officials expressing fears about an increase in electricity costs.\ The administration of Maryland Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. said it was not participating for similar reasons, as well as concerns about the possible closure of power plants.\ ""It's easy for these states up in New England to sign on. They don't have the coal-fired power plants we do,"" said state Environmental Secretary Kendl P. Philbrick. ""We are not going to do something that is going to be injurious to the citizens of Maryland, cost them more money or cause rolling brownouts or blackouts.""\ The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative creates a ""cap and trade"" system that will force power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or buy pollution credits from cleaner power plants.\ New York officials predict that the emission controls will raise electricity rates by $3 to $24 per year per household, starting in 2015. That year, carbon dioxide reductions will start to be required, rising 2.5 percent per year for four years.\ Advocates for the pollution limits say predictions of blackouts are off base, because the energy industry is enjoying record- breaking profits and can afford to shift from coal to alternative fuels.\ Brad Heavner, executive director of the Maryland Public Interest Research Group, said the Maryland Department of Environment has adopted the identical position as the power industry.\ He said it is not a coincidence, because half of the top officials appointed by the Ehrlich administration to run the state agency formerly worked for Constellation Energy, the state's largest owner of power plants.\ These MDE officials worked closely with their former employer this spring to lobby against an air pollution bill that would have limited carbon dioxide emissions, The Sun reported Sunday.\ ""We've heard the exact same things from the power companies, the same mistruths, the same rubbish,"" Heavner said. ""Yes, these limits would cost the power companies money, so you would expect them to oppose it. But would you expect our environmental agency to oppose it? No, because it's a clear winner for the environment and economy.""\ Although Maryland has often worked with Northeastern states to fight air pollution, the Ehrlich administration refused last spring to join a similar group suing the Bush administration over exemptions for power plants from strict mercury pollution rules.\ In the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, at least 25 percent of the money generated by the buying and selling of the pollution credits will be used to encourage businesses and families to buy more efficient machinery, buildings and appliances, said Peter Constantakes, spokesman for New York Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican. This increased efficiency will help offset higher electricity costs, he said.\ The funds will also provide grants to encourage alternative energies, such as solar and wind power. And some older power plants likely will shift from coal to natural gas, said Constantakes.\ New York has coal-fired power plants, and it does not expect any shutdowns or blackouts, Constantakes said.\ New Jersey's acting governor, Richard J. Codey, a Democrat, said in a written statement that the agreement by the seven states is historic and will advance efforts to combat global warming.\ ""In the absence of federal leadership, these states have come together to take real steps to cut carbon dioxide,"" Codey said.\ Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, backed out of the greenhouse gas agreement recently because of concerns about rising electricity rates, said spokesman Corbie Kiernan.\ ""The agreement would have added costs to Massachusetts electric bills, which are already the highest in the nation,"" Kiernan said.\ Credit: SUN REPORTER"
21,"In all likelihood, the U.S. will soon implement a cap-and-trade system to reduce its carbon emissions. Such a system sets a maximum level of pollution that the nation could emit each year. The system would create a limited number of emissions rights or permits that would decline over time. For each ton of carbon a polluter emits, it would need to hold one permit. Polluters would be allowed to buy and sell permits from each other as needed.\While some thoughtful people oppose cap-and-trade systems for a variety of good reasons, they have one important economic feature: Economists widely agree that a well-designed cap-and-trade system can minimize the costs of achieving whatever emissions reduction target policymakers choose.\But a critical question remains: How should we get the permits into the hands of polluters? This may be the single most important climate policy decision made by this Congress.\There are two main mechanisms for distributing permits to polluters: awarding them free on the basis of past emissions levels (often called ""grandfathering"") or requiring polluters to buy them through an auction. The implications of grandfathering vs. auctioning permits are complex, but the economic answer to this question is clear and unambiguous: Permits should be auctioned.\The reason is that the effect on energy prices will be the same whether the permits are sold or given away. No matter how permits are distributed, polluters will not receive enough permits to cover their current pollution levels, so at least some of them will need to pollute less. Polluters who can do it cheaply will cut their emissions and sell their unused permits to polluters with relatively high abatement costs. In either case, someone, somewhere, will now have to either pay for a permit or pay to cut pollution. They will pass at least some of those production cost increases to consumers. And once one producer increases prices, the rest will follow suit. To do otherwise would be to leave money on the table.\Not convinced? Try buying World Series tickets from a scalper. Would he charge you any less if he found the tickets on the ground or got them free from a friend inside the ticket office? Of course he wouldn't. Like energy, the street price of World Series tickets is based on supply and demand. The supply and demand for tickets is the same no matter how much the scalper paid for them, and so the price he charges you will also be the same no matter how he got them.\Of course, the scalper would much rather get his tickets for free - and that's precisely the point. Polluters are financially much better off if permits are given away instead of auctioned, but the cost of cutting emissions and the resulting effect on energy prices will be the same no matter how the permits are delivered.\Giving permits away allows polluters to raise their prices without raising their costs. It would transfer hundreds of billions of dollars every year from consumers and businesses to polluters - energy companies and their stockholders. No wonder the energy companies are lobbying for grandfathered permits.\But the rich-get-richer distribution of wealth is not all that is at stake. Cap-and-trade systems and the associated higher energy prices, while effectively reducing pollution, can cause some drag on the economy, slowing job creation and economic growth. We can use revenues from auctioning permits to cut taxes and promote economic growth, invest in energy efficiency and create jobs, or put them to other productive uses. If permits are grandfathered, the economic effects of a cap-and-trade system end with higher energy prices and the problems that come with them.\The European Union has implemented a cap-and-trade system that has largely failed because it gave away almost all of the permits. As climate policy discussions heat up in Congress, we need to remember that how permits are distributed is almost as important as the emissions cap itself.\To prevent windfall profits for polluters, affirm the public's right to compensation for pollution and accelerate growth, climate policy should use cap-and-auction to reduce emissions.\Kristen Sheeran, a professor at St. Mary's College of Maryland, is director of the Economics for Equity and the Environment network.

22,"Maryland isn't going to have two-thirds of its electrical energy needs supplied by wind anytime soon, but it's useful to know that the potential is there. As a study released this week by the Abell Foundation demonstrates, the state's capacity for offshore wind-powered energy is both vast and untapped.\What the report, prepared by the University of Delaware's Center for Carbon-free Power Integration, demonstrates is that existing technology is available to produce a huge amount of electricity 24 to 48 miles off the Atlantic Coast from Ocean City. Maryland has already pledged to use renewable energy to meet about one-quarter of its power needs in 12 years. Offshore wind could do the job.\There are numerous challenges involved. It's not clear what impact thousands of turbines could have on local marine ecology. Shipping lanes would have to be protected. Transmission lines (so often opposed by communities in a right-of-way) would have to be built. Wind power would have to be balanced with other sources of electricity to supply the grid when the weather proves too tranquil for turbines.\But the point is that the state lacks neither the wind nor the technology to make it happen. Denmark set a similar course a decade ago, and today the wind supplies one-fifth of that country's energy needs. Delaware's planned Bluewater Wind project could have more than 70 turbines producing electricity in several years.\What Maryland must avoid, however, is the kind of NIMBY battle that has paralyzed the similar Cape Wind project in Nantucket Sound for the past decade. There are few, if any, locations on the East Coast where birds would not be harmed by turbine blades. And while it's appropriate to respect Native American traditions and artifacts, should such concerns drive the nation's energy policy future?\The biggest hurdle for Maryland wind, however, is surely going to be the same challenge that all renewable energy sources face: the willingness of the state and the nation to commit to it. Public financing and tax incentives must be available. Most important, carbon emissions must be addressed either through a system of cap-and-trade, as President Barack Obama has proposed, or through a direct tax on greenhouse gases.\Until other forms of energy production are charged for the pollution they create and the contribution they make toward climate change, renewable forms of power will be seen as impractical. Our global competitors aren't likely to make that mistake. China is already making substantial investments in renewable power.\The sooner Maryland can take the wind power plunge, the better. Denmark's early commitment to wind power has allowed the country to be a global leader in the field - with thousands of jobs in designing, engineering and supplying the technology to others. Maryland could be in the same position within the U.S., but only if the general public is willing to support this unique opportunity.\Admittedly, that is likely to mean consumers will have to pay more for cleaner forms of energy in the short term. But in the long run, the savings are bound to be substantial - not just in dollars but in jobs, a cleaner environment, energy independence and future economic growth.\Readers respond\Substantial investment will be needed to set this type of project in motion. Do we have the money?\Also, development of wind energy on a massive scale has to be a private-public partnership with mere politicians turning into visionaries and everyone coming to the consensus that global warming is not a myth simply because the University of East Anglia scientists were not on the up and up about their research data.\Cap and trade, taxing greenhouse gas production - these are great ideas on paper. But where have you been lately? China may be developing green technology in the hope of making a killing on the global market by selling it to eager buyers, but in Copenhagen it acted more as an obstructionist, demanding that for it to decrease its greenhouse emissions the West would have to pay the bill.\We have an ambivalent polity and a skeptical citizenry, we have an entrenched energy sector that will lobby for its right to pollute, and in the face of these realities, hope does not spring eternal for wind power to sweep Maryland in the near future.\Anonymous"

Md. joins mercury lawsuit
\
BALTIMORE - Maryland is joining a multistate challenge to federal rules on mercury emissions from power plants.
\
In a lawsuit, state and local governments are asking the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to redo their mercury rules. They say the Clean Air Mercury Rule's ""cap-and-trade"" program won't actually reduce mercury emissions.
\
Former Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr., a Democrat, wanted to join the lawsuit when it was filed in 2005. But he was overruled by then-Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican.
\
In response, the Maryland Senate passed a resolution last year supporting the lawsuit.
\
The city of Baltimore joined the lawsuit under then-Mayor Martin O'Malley, a Democrat who is now governor.
\
In a statement, new state environment Secretary Shari T. Wilson said a change in leadership led to Maryland joining the lawsuit Wednesday.
\
""We have a new governor and a new attorney general who concur that participation in this case is important to protect the state's interests to safeguard its water resources and the health of its citizens,"" Ms. Wilson said.
\
Mercury is a neurotoxin that builds up in fish tissue. Advisories have been issued for many of Maryland's waterways warning against eating too much fish because of concerns about mercury contamination.

Former judge dies on courthouse steps
\
SILVER SPRING - A retired Montgomery County judge collapsed and died outside a county courthouse Wednesday in Silver Spring, authorities said.
\
L. Leonard Ruben, 81, collapsed about 9 a.m., as he was about to enter District Court, said Montgomery County Fire and Rescue spokesman Pete Piringer.
\
""A security guard saw him collapse, called 911 and came to his aid and initiated CPR,"" Mr. Piringer said. He was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead.
\
A cause of death was not immediately announced.
\
Judge Ruben was heading to court to hear cases on the traffic docket, Montgomery County State's Attorney John McCarthy told WTOP- FM.

Body found floating at Inner Harbor
\
BALTIMORE - City workers collecting trash Wednesday from the surface of the Inner Harbor found a body.
\
Detectives were investigating the discovery as a suspicious death and would determine whether it was accidental or a homicide, said Detective Donny Moses, a Baltimore Police Department spokesman.
\
Police officers and firefighters pulled the body from the water just after noon. It appeared to be that of an adult man, said Kevin Cartwright, a Baltimore Fire Department spokesman. The body was taken to the medical examiner's office.
\
The Department of Public Works crew members were picking up trash from a boat when they spotted the body about 11:30 a.m. alongside the USS Constellation, which is tied up as a tourist attraction at the Inner Harbor amphitheater.
\
""They were just doing their normal job of cleaning the harbor,"" said Kurt Kocher, a Department of Public Works spokesman.

Federal environmental officials said Monday that if Maryland and 27 other states don't come up with plans to reduce power plant pollution, they'll do it for them.
\
The Environmental Protection Agency ordered states in the East, South, Midwest and the District of Columbia to write ""implementation plans"" to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide from power plants by September, 2006. If the states fail to do so, the EPA will write the plans for them.
\
""We are another step closer to cutting and capping power plant pollution in the eastern United States,"" Jeff Holmstead, EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation, said in a statement.
\
Maryland officials have blamed much of the state's air pollution problems on soot that comes into the state from sources in the Midwest.
\
Maryland Department of the Environment spokesman Richard McIntire said his agency already is working on the state's implementation plan.
\
""We plan on making the deadline,"" he said.
\
The EPA announcement moves the new ""Clean Air Interstate Rule"" forward, an effort to curb pollution that floats from one state to another.
\
According to the EPA, Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide contribute to ""fine particle pollution,"" also known as soot. And nitrogen oxide contributes to ground-level ozone.
\
The Clean Air Interstate Rule has been criticized by environmentalists, though. They've said CAIR should require more reductions in a faster time frame. The rules rely on a cap-and- trade program, so if one plant doesn't meet pollution reductions, it can buy credits from a plant that has exceeded the required reductions.
\
""In general, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and many states felt CAIR didn't go far enough,"" said Dr. Beth McGee, a senior scientist at nonprofit foundation.
\
Brad Heavner, director of the Maryland Public Interest Research Group, said yesterday's announcement simply sets a deadline for states to deal with CAIR, and not much more.
\
Mr. Heavner, though he praised the EPA for using ""tougher wording.""
\
Mr. Heavner and Dr. McGee said the flaws in CAIR are another reason for Maryland to enact its own, stricter regulations. In the past few years, bills died in the General Assembly that would have cut pollution from vehicles and power plants.
\
Other states affected by the new regulations are Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

"
26," In a boon for the energy industry and a setback for environmentalists, the Bush administration is expected to announce soon that it is weakening portions of the Clean Air Act, allowing coal-burning power plants to bypass some anti-pollution rules.\ President Bush has argued that some Clean Air Act rules stifle energy output and do little to protect the environment. That stance has angered environmentalists, but it was mostly forgotten after Sept. 11. Now, riding high on wartime approval ratings, Bush is revisiting some of his more hotly disputed proposals, including the idea of easing some environmental regulations.\ Word of the announcement has set off a new storm of protest from environmental groups. They say the move would stymie efforts by local and state officials to bring heavy polluters to court. And some members of Congress have complained that the administration has not consulted them about changing the law.\ At issue is a clause in the 1970 Clean Air Act that applies to aging power plants, oil refineries and other industrial facilities.\ The clause exempts such plants built before 1970 from tough pollution curbs enacted that year.\ But once they undergo a major renovation to expand output, such facilities must install pollution controls and begin meeting the 1970 standards.\ Under President Clinton, the Environmental Protection Agency and several Eastern states, including Maryland, sued dozens of the nation's oldest and dirtiest power plants for violating the law.\ They argued that the plants, mostly in the Midwest, underwent renovations yet never installed tighter pollution controls.\ Pollutants from those plants, officials in Maryland and other states argue, blow east and contribute to smog in cities such as Washington, Baltimore and New York.\ ""These issues are a matter of life and death,"" said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.\ Blumenthal asserted that the administration is trying to scale back parts of the Clean Air Act just when states are beginning to use it successfully to reduce pollution.\ ""These laws have been on the books for more than 30 years,"" Blumenthal said. ""And the power companies have been violating them brazenly and blatantly, purposely and continuously.""\ Allegations disputed\ In response to the lawsuits, the utility companies contend that the law should not apply because they underwent maintenance, not major renovations.\ The companies also deny that they contribute to pollution in far- flung states. There is little scientific proof, they note, that pollutants can travel so far.\ Industry officials argue further that the lawsuits filed by Clinton's EPA have made them wary of performing routine maintenance.\ The administration's plan to ease what is known as the ""new source review"" clause of the Clean Air Act, the industry says, would not only help boost output but also cut emissions.\ As regulations are eased, utilities could determine for themselves the most efficient ways to produce power.\ ""We'll be providing more electricity with the same amount of coal - or less coal,"" said Todd Terrell, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Southern Co., which owns a handful of power plants that were sued under Clinton. ""Emissions on the whole will go down. So that, we believe, is the best environmental approach.""\ Study called\ In May, as part of his energy initiative, Bush called for a study of the new source review clause. He said he worried that it forced power plants to invest in costly upgrades to comply with a bewildering environmental rule - and diverted money and attention away from producing electricity.\ Administration officials have not said precisely what they will announce and when.\ They say only that they are close to recommending changes to the Clean Air Act. But in an effort to defuse criticism pre-emptively, they stress that they have held public hearings to discuss proposals and have fully cooperated with Congress.\ `Worst holiday presents'\ Dave Ryan, an EPA spokesman, said the agency offered ""unprecedented opportunities for public involvement"" before reaching conclusions.\ But environmental attorneys and congressional officials who have been briefed by the administration say the EPA has prepared new guidelines for how to enforce new source review.\ ""This is one of the worst holiday presents the administration could give the American people,"" said Rep. Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who is on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""I hope they reconsider.""\ `Political capital'\ For several months, many of Bush's priorities have been put on hold.\ But in recent weeks, the administration has begun lobbying anew for some agenda items that had sparked criticism earlier.\ Bush recently announced that the United States was withdrawing from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia in order to pursue a missile defense system. Now, the president appears on the verge of delving back into battles with environmentalists.\ Bush officials say the timing of the announcement will be determined by when the EPA finishes its review, and not by the political atmosphere.\ Still, Bush's chief political adviser, Karl Rove, speaking generally, acknowledged that Bush would begin leveraging his wartime popularity to advance other pieces of his agenda.\ ""The president understands that if we are successful in the prosecution of the war, that will create political capital,"" Rove said. ""If you don't spend it, it's not like treasures stuck away in a storehouse someplace; it is perishable.""\ Officials familiar with the EPA's proposals say the agency is likely to make clear that maintenance work or relatively minor upgrades at power plants would not justify a lawsuit. Industry officials have been lobbying for such a guideline.\ The EPA is also expected to recommend changes in how emissions from power plants are calculated.\ Under the changes, the industry could more easily argue that a renovation did not result in more pollution.\ Cap and trade approach\ Bush has insisted that he is committed to protecting the environment.\ He favors a ""market-based"" approach to pollution control and has said he wants to establish rigorous new limits on how much industrial pollution - sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury - can be released.\ Utilities would choose on their own how to meet those standards. They would use a ""cap and trade"" system in which companies would be rewarded for reducing pollution or could pay for the right to pollute more.\ Bush officials note that since 1980, a limited version of this system has cut emissions that contribute to acid rain by 35 percent.\ Jeffrey Holmstead, a Bush appointee who serves as assistant administrator at the EPA, warned a congressional panel last month that forcing older plants to meet new source review standards ""could undermine the benefits of the cap-and-trade approach.""\ Holmstead said ""the current Clean Air Act has been enormously successful, but we can do better.""\ The utility industry heavily supported Bush's presidential campaign and has hired such heavyweight lobbyists as Haley Barbour, a former Republican national chairman, and C. Boyden Gray, who was a White House counsel under Bush's father.\ `No substance left'\ Environmental groups are mounting their own lobbying offensive, arguing that the package of changes being considered by the EPA would create enough loopholes to render new source review useless.\ ""This will be like taking a dollar bill and shooting 20 bullets through it,"" said Sandra Schubert, a lawyer with the environmental firm Earthjustice. ""There will be no substance left.""\ Some lawmakers have complained that the EPA appeared on the verge of amending the Clean Air Act without consulting them.\ Several senators, including James M. Jeffords, a Vermont independent, and Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, wrote to EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, expressing concern about ""rumored changes"" to new source review ""that might undermine its benefits.""\ They insisted that all documents involved in the review of the program be saved and sent to the Environment and Public Works Committee, which Jeffords chairs.\ One congressional aide involved in environmental issues said some lawmakers are already discussing whether legislation could reverse whatever changes to the Clean Air Act are proposed.\ The aide suggested that some of the proposals the EPA is considering might conflict with the intent of the 1970 law.\ ""And that's what congressional oversight is supposed to prevent from happening,"" the aide said.\ Credit: SUN NATIONAL STAFF"
27,"
Tomorrow morning, energy company bigwigs will huddle around computer monitors to take part in a historic auction that could improve the environment.
\
The nation's first auction for carbon-dioxide allowances, years in the making, is set to start at 9 a.m., and Maryland power plants will be among the buyers.
\
Constellation Energy, the parent company of Baltimore Gas and Electric Co., will be involved. The company operates two power plants in the county - the Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner plants on the Patapsco River in Pasadena.
\
All major power plants in 10 Northeastern states eventually will have to buy carbon allowances at auctions because starting Jan. 1, they can't emit one iota of carbon without owning the proper number of allowances.
\
Money they pay for the credits will go to the state governments for energy-efficiency programs for consumers.
\
The carbon auction is part of an ambitious and groundbreaking effort called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The initiative, called RGGI for short and pronounced ""Reggie,"" is the first of its kind in America.
\
Supporters hope it's a model for other regional carbon programs or, better yet, a national program.
\
""The auction of carbon permits for states from Maine to Maryland is historic, no doubt about it,"" said Mike Tidwell, founder and director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.
\
Carbon dioxide is a key emission that leads to the greenhouse effect that traps the sun's heat in the atmosphere. That, in turn, could lead to sea levels rising and shifts in climate patterns - the effects of which could be devastating.
\
The federal government hasn't acted to reduce carbon dioxide, which comes primarily from power plants and car tailpipes. So, some states have decided to make an effort on their own, creating their own carbon-reduction programs.
\
""It's going to be a historic day for the U.S. getting a grip on carbon dioxide. This is the first step,"" said Jonathan Schrag, who is executive director of RGGI Inc., the nonprofit company created to coordinate the selling of carbon allowances.
\
How it works
\
The states participating in RGGI agreed on an initial regional cap on carbon emissions, 188 million tons per year, that will be enforced through 2014. Starting in 2015, the cap will be reduced 2.5 percent each year.
\
Each allowance represents 1 ton of carbon dioxide, and they'll be sold at auctions that will be held quarterly. This week's initial auction will sell 12.5 million allowances. The minimum price is $1.86 per ton, but the actual price won't be determined until the auction.
\
If power plants reduce their emissions significantly and have allowances left over, they can sell them to others. On the other hand, if a given power plant emits more carbon dioxide than they have credits for, they would have to buy more credits, either at auction or from other plants.
\
The theory behind the program - called cap-and-trade - is that carbon-dioxide emissions will now have a price attached to them, which will be an incentive for companies to emit less.
\
Companies that make real progress in cutting emissions can make money by selling allowances. Also, outside investors can buy and sell allowances to companies that need them.
\
There's some concern that the emissions trading might not work as well as envisioned.
\
Some say 188 million tons is too low because energy consumption - and therefore carbon-dioxide emissions - has decreased since the cap was set a few years ago.
\
If there are more allowances than needed, the prices could be so low that the financial incentives for companies to reduce carbon emissions could disappear.
\
Mr. Schrag discounted those concerns, saying he's confident that the economics will work out over time and pollution, indeed, will be reduced.
\
""We're not concerned with the level of the price,"" he said. ""We're concerned about getting the market mechanism right.""
\
Local power plants
\
All told, 233 power plants in 10 states (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland) will have to buy carbon allowances.
\
Officials at Constellation Energy declined to comment on the auction, saying it would be speculative to do so. But they said RGGI is a start toward having a national carbon-dioxide program.
\
The Baltimore-based company, which was just agreed to be sold to one of Warren Buffett's companies, has nine power plants that fall under RGGI. These plants emit a total of about 14 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the company.
\
Two plants are in Anne Arundel - the Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner plants on the Patapsco River in Pasadena. According to unofficial state data, Brandon Shores, which was built in 1984, emitted about 8.1 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2005, making it the single largest source in the state. The Wagner plant, built in 1956, emitted nearly 2.4 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2005.
\
'Tangible step'
\
The decision for Maryland to join RGGI was not made lightly.
\
Joining RGGI was part of the Healthy Air Act, which was approved by state lawmakers and signed into law by then-Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. in 2006.
\
Sponsors of the bill failed three times before getting a version passed. They had to overcome worries that consumers would pay a high price for electricity.
\
Lawmakers were concerned and wanted to evaluate the effects on consumers. The resulting study from the University of Maryland showed a net benefit for consumers.
\
While electric bill prices might initially go up - RGGI estimates $1 per month - consumers will save money in the long run because the money raised through the auctions will be plowed back into consumer-friendly energy-efficiency programs.
\
At a minimum, the Maryland government could get $70 million a year for use in energy-efficiency programs. And that's only if the allowances sell for the minimum price. As the prices go up, so does the funding for energy efficiency.
\
State officials are still figuring out how to spend the money, and ideas include helping low-income families weatherize their houses and giving grants for home solar panels.
\
""We're looking forward to having an unprecedented level of programming for energy conservation,"" said Shari T. Wilson, the state's secretary of the environment. ""This will take it to an entirely different level.""
\
""This is the moment we've been waiting for,"" said Brad Heavner of Environment Maryland, who pushed lawmakers to join RGGI. ""Everyone wants more clean energy, and there's a widespread acceptance that it's a good thing to do to put public resources into it. But we've never been able to come up with the money.""
\
Participating in RGGI is just one way that Maryland is trying to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. Though the state plays a minor role in contributing to the global problem, state leaders place importance on the symbolic value of action.
\
Other state programs eventually will require more low-emissions cars to be sold here and will require state government offices to use less electricity.
\

STATE TO PARTICIPATE IN FIRST CARBON DIOXIDE AUCTION
"
28,"
On Thursday morning, energy company bigwigs will huddle around computer monitors to take part in a historic auction that could improve the environment.
\
The nation's first auction for carbon-dioxide allowances, years in the making, is set to start at 9 a.m., and Maryland power plants will be among the buyers.
\
All major power plants in 10 Northeastern states eventually will have to buy carbon allowances at auctions because starting Jan. 1, they can't emit one iota of carbon without owning the proper number of allowances.
\
Money they pay for the credits will go to the state governments for energy-efficiency programs for consumers.
\
The carbon auction is part of an ambitious and groundbreaking effort called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The initiative, called RGGI for short and pronounced ""Reggie,"" is the first of its kind in America.
\
Supporters hope it's a model for other regional carbon programs or, better yet, a national program.
\
""The auction of carbon permits for states from Maine to Maryland is historic, no doubt about it,"" said Mike Tidwell, founder and director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.
\
Carbon dioxide is a key emission that leads to the greenhouse effect that traps the sun's heat in the atmosphere. That, in turn, could lead to sea levels rising and shifts in climate patterns - the effects of which could be dev-astating.
\
The federal government hasn't acted to reduce carbon dioxide, which comes primarily from power plants and car tailpipes. So, some states have decided to make an effort on their own, creating their own carbon-reduction programs.
\
""It's going to be a historic day for the U.S. getting a grip on carbon dioxide. This is the first step,"" said Jonathan Schrag, who is executive director of RGGI Inc., the nonprofit company created to coordinate the selling of carbon allowances.
\
How it works
\
The states participating in RGGI agreed on an initial regional cap on carbon emissions, 188 million tons per year, that will be enforced through 2014. Starting in 2015, the cap will be reduced 2.5 percent each year.
\
Each allowance represents 1 ton of carbon dioxide, and they'll be sold at auctions that will be held quarterly. This week's initial auction will sell 12.5 million allowances. The minimum price is $1.86 per ton, but the actual price won't be determined until the auction.
\
If power plants reduce their emissions significantly and have allowances left over, they can sell them to others. On the other hand, if a given power plant emits more carbon dioxide than they have credits for, they would have to buy more credits, either at auction or from other plants.
\
The theory behind the program - called cap-and-trade - is that carbon-dioxide emissions will now have a price attached to them, which will be an incentive for companies to emit less.
\
Companies that make real progress in cutting emissions can make money by selling allowances. Also, outside investors can buy and sell allowances to companies that need them.
\
There's some concern that the emissions trading might not work as well as envisioned.
\
Some say 188 million tons is too low because energy consumption - and therefore carbon-dioxide emissions - has decreased since the cap was set a few years ago.
\
If there are more allowances than needed, the prices could be so low that the financial incentives for companies to reduce carbon emissions could disappear.
\
Mr. Schrag discounted those concerns, saying he's confident that the economics will work out over time and pollution, indeed, will be reduced.
\
""We're not concerned with the level of the price,"" he said. ""We're concerned about getting the market mechanism right.""
\
Local power plants
\
All told, 233 power plants in 10 states (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland) will have to buy carbon allowances.
\
Officials at Constellation Energy declined to comment on the auction, saying it would be speculative to do so. But they said RGGI is a start toward having a national carbon-dioxide program.
\
The Baltimore-based company, which was just agreed to be sold to one of Warren Buffett's companies, has nine power plants that fall under RGGI. These plants emit a total of about 14 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the company.
\
Two plants are in Anne Arundel - the Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner plants on the Patapsco River in Pasadena. According to unofficial state data, Brandon Shores, which was built in 1984, emitted about 8.1 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2005, making it the single largest source in the state. The Wagner plant, built in 1956, emitted nearly 2.4 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2005.
\
'Tangible step'
\
The decision for Maryland to join RGGI was not made lightly.
\
Joining RGGI was part of the Healthy Air Act, which was approved by state lawmakers and signed into law by then-Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. in 2006.
\
Sponsors of the bill failed three times before getting a version passed. They had to overcome worries that consumers would pay a high price for electricity.
\
Lawmakers were concerned and wanted to evaluate the effects on consumers. The resulting study from the University of Maryland showed a net benefit for consumers.
\
While electric bill prices might initially go up - RGGI estimates $1 per month - consumers will save money in the long run because the money raised through the auctions will be plowed back into consumer-friendly energy-efficiency programs.
\
At a minimum, the Maryland government could get $70 million a year for use in energy-efficiency programs. And that's only if the allowances sell for the minimum price. As the prices go up, so does the funding for energy efficiency.
\
State officials are still figuring out how to spend the money, and ideas include helping low-income families weatherize their houses and giving grants for home solar panels.
\
""We're looking forward to having an unprecedented level of programming for energy conservation,"" said Shari T. Wilson, the state's secretary of the environment. ""This will take it to an entirely different level.""
\
""This is the moment we've been waiting for,"" said Brad Heavner of Environment Maryland, who pushed lawmakers to join RGGI. ""Everyone wants more clean energy, and there's a widespread acceptance that it's a good thing to do to put public resources into it. But we've never been able to come up with the money.""
\
Participating in RGGI is just one way that Maryland is trying to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. Though the state plays a minor role in contributing to the global problem, state leaders place importance on the symbolic value of action.
\
Other state programs eventually will require more low-emissions cars to be sold here and will require state government offices to use less electricity.
\
But RGGI represents the first time something concrete has been done about carbon emissions in Maryland, Ms. Wilson said.
\
""I think it's very important to start getting on-the-ground reduction programs It's a tangible step forward,"" she said. {Corrections:} {Status:}

STATE TO PARTICIPATE IN FIRST CARBON DIOXIDE AUCTION
"
29," North Carolina petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency yesterday to crack down on coal-fired power plants in Maryland and 12 other states whose emissions allegedly hinder North Carolina's efforts to clean its air.\ Maryland officials, more accustomed to seeing their state as a victim of dirty air from power plants to the west, say they are already working to cut the level of dangerous air pollution emitted by the state's utilities.\ But given geography and prevailing westerly winds, they expressed surprise at the complaint from a state that lies almost directly south of Maryland, separated by a sizable chunk of Virginia.\ ""The pollutants that our sources in Maryland emit are carried downwind in the same way that pollutants in the Midwest are carried downwind,"" said Kathy Kinsey, an assistant attorney general in the Maryland Department of the Environment. ""That's the nature of the transport problem.""\ But she said she has difficulty thinking of North Carolina as being downwind. ""It's counterintuitive to me, too,"" she declared.\ In his petition to the EPA, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper argued that the out-of-state power plants are interfering with his state's efforts to meet federal clean air standards.\ In particular, he named sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides (which form soot and droplets called ""fine particulate matter"") and the compounds that contribute to ozone formation. They contribute to a variety of human health and environmental problems.\ ""Since we can't stop air pollution at the state line, we want to cut it off at the source,"" Cooper said.\ Halting operations\ The petition was filed under Section 126 of the federal Clean Air Act, which allows any state or local government to ask the EPA to rule that a major upwind polluter is unlawfully dirtying the air in a downwind state.\ If the EPA agrees with the petition, it can force the utilities to halt operations within three months, or agree to a plan to reach compliance within three years.\ Ironically, North Carolina, Maryland and 20 other states were named in 1997 as sources of interstate air pollution in a similar Section 126 petition filed by eight Northeastern states.\ If North Carolina prevails in its own petition, its victory might work in Maryland's favor, officials here say.\ ""Given the fact that many of these states [targeted by North Carolina] are among the states that send pollutants to Maryland, it will be interesting to see what the EPA's reaction is,"" said Jeff Welsh, communications director for the Maryland Department of the Environment.\ Computer models\ North Carolina used three meteorological computer models to identify which states were likely to be the most significant sources of out-of-state pollution, and what proportion of that pollution each contributes.\ The petition names Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia as significant sources of the sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides that form particulate pollution reaching North Carolina.\ Maryland is named as one of five states that contribute significantly to North Carolina's ozone pollution. The others are South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia and Tennessee.\ Maryland surprised\ Maryland's contribution appears to be the smallest of the five. According to the ozone modeling outlined in the petition, even if all the polluting sources in Maryland were shut down, Mecklenburg County in North Carolina would see as little as a 1 percent reduction in ozone.\ ""I was a little bit surprised that we were named,"" Welsh said. But ""they've picked a threshold and we were above it in this particular case.""\ Maryland has eight coal-fired generating stations. The largest are Constellation Power Source Generation's 1,296-megawatt Brandon Shores station in northern Anne Arundel County and Mirant Corp.'s 1,164- megawatt Morgantown station in southern Charles County.\ The EPA has long targeted the Baltimore and Washington regions for some of the most serious and persistent air pollution in the nation. As a consequence, Maryland has been involved for years in a tangle of legal efforts to reduce emissions from ""upwind"" electrical generating stations that make it harder for the state to clean its air.\ Litigation coalition\ Kinsey said Maryland joined a coalition of seven or eight Northeastern states in litigation against American Electric Power, which owns coal-fired plants in the Midwest. That case is scheduled for trial in May 2005.\ Maryland also joined 11 other states seeking to block regulations by the Bush administration that they believe would make it easier for power plant operators to make repairs without concurrent upgrades to reduce emissions.\ The state was a partner several years ago in a Section 126 petition similar to North Carolina's, seeking a federal crackdown on Midwestern power plants.\ ""Our petition was never acted on,"" Kinsey said. Instead, the EPA applied the ruling from an earlier petition by a group of Northeastern states.\ The result was a ""transport rule"" that is now being implemented in 22 states east of the Mississippi River, she said. It established a federally regulated, ""cap and trade"" program that sets pollution limits and creates economic incentives for utilities to clean their emissions. Utilities that exceed their pollution limits will have to buy pollution credits from those that have reduced their emissions below the imposed limits.\ The plan must be in place in all 22 states by May. ""So we're looking forward to seeing some significant reductions from the Midwest as a result,"" Kinsey said.\ Kinsey said some power plants in Maryland, including Constellation's Brandon Shores and Wagner stations, have begun to install cleaner technology.\ Efforts questioned\ But not everyone is satisfied with the state's efforts. ""There are still not nearly enough controls on power plants in Maryland, especially our oldest and dirtiest plants,"" said Brad Heavner, state director of the Maryland Public Interest Research Group.\ ""We have 10 power plants that have never been required to use modern pollution controls,"" he said. ""This is a problem for Maryland and a problem, evidently, for North Carolina. ... Why isn't Maryland taking stronger action?""\ Credit: SUN STAFF"
30," Md. to join 16 states in pollution lawsuit\ Reversing a decision by the last governor, Gov. Martin O'Malley has decided to have Maryland join 16 other states in suing the Bush administration to try to force tougher federal regulations to control mercury air pollution.\ ""We have a new governor and a new attorney general who concur that participation in this case is important to protect the state's interest to safeguard its water resources and the health of its citizens,"" said Shari T. Wilson, the state's environment secretary.\ New York, California, Pennsylvania and other groups joined several environmental organizations in 2005 in filing a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington challenging federal rules for controlling mercury air pollution from coal-burning power plants.\ The Bush administration's Clean Air Mercury Rule sets up a market- friendly ""cap-and-trade"" system allowing power plants to buy pollution credits instead of installing pollution control equipment. The plaintiffs contend this could allow local ""hot spots"" of mercury pollution, which accumulates in fish and can cause brain damage in children.\ Two years ago, then-state Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. wanted to join the lawsuit against Bush to force all power plants to install the best available pollution control equipment. But former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. blocked Curran from filing the suit.\ Tom Pelton\ Ground-rent bill gets initial OK\ The state Senate gave preliminary approval yesterday to a bill that would prevent ground rent holders from using a process known as ""ejectment"" to take the homes of people who fall behind on payments.\ The bill is identical to one passed by the House of Delegates and could receive final approval in the Senate by the end of the week. Gov. Martin O'Malley has pledged to sign the measure.\ Ground rent reform has been a major topic of this year's General Assembly session as lawmakers have sought to correct abuses documented by The Sun in a series of articles last year. The newspaper found cases in which homeowners lost their houses over initial debts of as little as $24.\ O'Malley is scheduled to sign the first of the reforms -- one forbidding the establishment of new ground rents -- at a ceremony today. Eight ground rent bills received final passage in the House on Tuesday, and the Senate is poised to take final votes on its versions.\ The ejectment bill was delayed in the Senate as some lawmakers sought to amend it to grant ground rent holders higher legal fees when they attempt to collect back payments.\ The bill caps fees at $150 for the part of the process in which the ground-rent holders search for the address of the homeowner to send notice of the past-due bills. Sen. Katherine A. Klausmeier, a Baltimore County Democrat, attempted to remove the limit.\ But Sen. Brian E. Frosh, a Montgomery County Democrat, said computerized records allow that search to be done online at no charge. The amendment was defeated on a voice vote.\ Andrew A. Green\ Bill tightens rules on lenders\ The General Assembly approved a bill that would make it illegal for lenders to use a bank's name, logo or trademark, or something similar, to deceive or mislead customers into refinancing mortgages or taking out a home equity line of credit.\ The Maryland Bankers Association sought the legislation, saying banking customers were receiving offers in the mail from what appeared to be their bank. Customers of County National Bank in Glen Burnie, for example, received letters from an entity called County Nat'l Bk, said Kathleen M. Murphy, president of the association. She said the solicitations may come from authorized lenders but often put borrowers in a loan with a higher interest rate.\ The bill, which passed the House of Delegates unanimously yesterday, creates monetary penalties of damages plus $1,000 for each violation of the law. The Senate approved a companion measure this month.\ Laura Smitherman"

The setting this week was a wood-paneled Capitol Hill hearing room, with soaring ceilings and plush blue drapes.
\
With camera-friendly lights blazing down, one by one politicians and experts imparted their message: It's well past time to deal with global warming, if there's any chance of saving the Chesapeake Bay from the worst consequences of global climate change.
\
They came armed with reports from the National Wildlife Federation and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, outlining the worst of the worst.
\
The governors from Maryland and Virginia were there, along with senators and congressmen from the two states. The head of the committee was sold on the issue, and other congressional leaders also have expressed a desire to limit the emission of greenhouse gases that cause global warming.
\
But can politicians really make a difference? And will they act soon?
\
Brad Heavner of the advocacy group Environment Maryland said after the hearing that there's no question that Congress - and state lawmakers, too - can make a difference.
\
What's needed, Mr. Heavner and other advocates agree, is a national system to limit emissions of greenhouse gases.The general consensus is for some sort of ""cap and trade system,"" wherein polluters would be subject to emissions caps, but those who achieve extra emissions reductions can sell credits to those having a hard time meeting the caps.
\
Differences are in the details of how the programs would work and how much of a cut is needed.
\
Mr. Heavner said he's heartened to see such attention in Washington to the concern of global warming.
\
""Previously, you could hardly mention global warming,"" he said.
\
But he worries that with the pressure to act quickly, lawmakers might not pass a strong enough bill.
\
""I'd rather keep the bar high than compromise,"" he said.
\
Diana Dascalu-Joffe, chief deputy director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, expects anything that passes in the near future won't have strong enough limits on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
\
""It's going to be a compromise bill, so the states have to still have to take the lead on aggressive legislation,"" she said.
\
Climate activists aren't just spending their time on Capitol Hill. Around the country, environmentalists have been pressuring state lawmakers to pass their own measures to cap greenhouse gas emissions.
\
In 2006, California famously was the first to act, with its own cap-and-trade program to cut greenhouse gas emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020.
\
Maryland lawmakers tried to pass a similar bill in the 2007 General Assembly session, though their effort failed. Lawmakers plan to bring back the bill for the 2008 session.
\
Even if Maryland and other states enact their own greenhouse gas caps, it won't be enough, many agree. Global warming is a global problem, after all.
\
As U.S. Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski put it during the hearing: ""Patchwork doesn't work.""
\
U.S. Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin said the states are, in fact, doing some of Congress's work for them.
\
""I agree a patchmeal approach won't work, but we can learn from the states,"" he said. Turning to Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, he added: ""You're giving us workable models.""
\
In addition to the need for a national program to cut greenhouse gases, another theme stressed this week was that the health of the bay hangs in the balance.
\
""It is part of the soul and culture and economy of our great state. If the bay goes, so will Maryland, so will Virginia, so will our way of life, so will our economy,"" Ms. Mikulski said.
\
Will Baker, head of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, urged lawmakers to act, and act soon.
\
""A national treasure, the birthplace of our great nation, will thank you.""
\
What is Global Warming? According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, global warming occurs when certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, build up in the earth's atmosphere. Those gases trap heat, instead of allowing it to dissipate away from Earth - thus the nickname, ""greenhouse effect.""
\
The result is increased air temperature and melting of glaciers and ice caps. Those, in turn, can lead to sea level rise and changes in the climate around the globe - including the possibility of more frequent or more severe storms.
\
An international group that studies the matter, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, issued a report earlier this year that said it is ""very likely"" that human activities are contributing to warming.
\
Those activities include burning fossil fuels, mainly through generating electricity and driving vehicles. Other man-made sources of greenhouse gases include industry, agriculture and waste management, according to the EPA.

Greenbury Point
\
Joe Lamp is concerned about the inhumane killing of deer by rifle at Greenbury Point (The Capital, May 4).
\
Consider: How many deer are drowned when crossing frozen lakes on ice that is too thin? (They slowly sink from sight after thrashing unsuccessfully.) How many die from starvation after yarding up after heavy snowfalls and eating all the surrounding browse and whose carcasses are found after the snow melts? Deer who run through crusted snow, too thin to support their weight and whose skin on their shins wears away and exposes milky white bone oozing tiny beads of blood. Deer who jump over road barriers and fall below to their death, some waiting in pain to be euthanized. I have seen a desiccated deer carcass seemingly garroted by a barbed wire fence. I hope she was dead when the cows pecked out her eyeballs.
\
The two rebuilt bull moose, horns locked in mortal combat on display at the Manchester, N.H., airport terminal - they both died from exhaustion/starvation, hopefully before the predators started chewing on them. Lastly, the tens of thousands of deer crippled by cars who then crawl into the woods to die a slow death.
\
Joe, I say that Mother Nature is far more cruel than any marksman with a rifle who can kill a deer with one shot.

Political threat
\
Me thinks the sudden accusations by two female employees versus Mr. Leopold are a plot by Maryland's majority party to undermine his credibility.
\
Mr. Leopold and the County Council have done a fantastic job in managing the county budget during these trying times.
\
Anne Arundel residents have been blessed by first having Bobby Neal and now Mr. Leopold as county executives during financial crises. No other suburban county in Maryland enjoys the lower taxes we have due to their prudent management.
\
It is unfortunate that Gov. O'Malley, Senate President Miller, majority leader Busch, and the Anne Arundel County school board / Superintendent Maxwell, didn't show similar budgetary restraint. Instead we hear alibis, obfuscations and whining about their predicament.
\
In the next fiscal year, they will not have $1 billion plus federal, stimulation ""funny money"" to save their butt.
\
The Thornton Mandates foolishly passed by Gov. Glendenning and his legislative accomplices, created Maryland's current budget problem.
\
I believe Maryland's majority party has launched a smear campaign because Mr. Leopold made common sense budget cuts when they didn't. They see Mr. Leopold as a potential political threat. So the smear is on, and The Capital will gleefully continue to feature them on their front page. We can't have an intelligently run government down the street from the imprudent State Circle wastrels.

Kratovil's voting record
\
U.S. Rep. Frank Kratovil, D-Kent Island, must think that this constituents are naive.
\
Mr. Kratovil goes around the district trumpeting his ""fiscally conservative"" vote against President Obama's stimulus bill. True, Mr. Kratovil voted against the pork-laden stimulus plan the first time. But that was before he voted for the stimulus plan the second time. This bill contains virtually no stimulus items, but it did provide for bonuses for AIG executives, generous union pay-offs and a bailout of fiscally irresponsible California.
\
Recently, Mr. Kratovil has been telling his conservative district that he voted against President Obama's budget. He did, but not before voting against several Republican amendments that would have capped federal spending, stripped out Obama's plans to have government bureaucrats deliver your health care and implement ""cap and trade,"" which is nothing more than a tax on the American taxpayers.
\
Mr. Kratovil won election to Congress because he ran under the self-proclaimed banner of ""fiscally conservative Democrat."" Yet he has voted in favor of every single tax increase, pork project and earmark proposed by the Democratic leadership in Washington. Clearly, Mr. Kratovil is not a ""fiscal conservative;"" instead, he is a party-line liberal who is trying to camouflage his voting record.

Living with deer
\
What are people thinking? The idea that we should allow a wild and dirty animal to roam freely about the community spreading ticks and Lyme disease as well as destroying valuable property, not to mention the hazards that they create on dark nights on the highway, is both ridiculous and naive.
\
It is easy for those who do not live with these pests to criticize those who support and execute a reduction of the herd. They should try living in an area where serious personal precautions need to be taken to avoid a tick born disease. They many want to invest in the landscaping that is destroyed every day by over-grazing by the hunger driven animals as well as clean up after their dropping.
\
The problem is quite simple. Humans have allowed the natural predators of the deer to be wiped out and thus there is no control over the herd size. If a hunt is not implemented the deer simply increase in numbers until disease and starvation limit the herd size. This is truly not humane. The idea of birth control does not address the current deer herd size. Perhaps it is a solution for the future, after the herd is reduced to sustainable levels.
\
Let's address the deer problem in a rational way and not evoke images of starving fawns and pregnant female deer. It is up to the human population to act as the replacement for the deer's natural predators and manage the herd for both humans and the deer. We are not dealing here with Bambie, but with a real threat to our environment and our health.

To appreciate the impact of a McCain administration on the health of the Chesapeake Bay, one needs to understand the strong stewardship ethic that guides Sen. John McCains policy decisions. Mr. McCain cites three strong influences that shape his approach to protecting the environment. The first is his personal hero Theodore Roosevelt. Mr. McCain is a true expert on Roosevelt and his conservation legacy. He has said he will appoint environmental officials who reflect a conservation ethic reminiscent of great conservation champions like Roosevelt. The second is the late Morris K. Udall. Udall, a Democratic congressman who is revered as one of our nations greatest environmental champions; he was also a close friend of Mr. McCain. The two teamed up to protect more than 3 million acres of wilderness in their home state of Arizona. The third is the Grand Canyon, which Mr. McCain says is a special, sacred place whose timeless beauty moves me. He refers to it as a monumental inspiration regarding our obligation to be faithful stewards. Mr. McCain has made it his mission to advocate policies that protect the interests of future generations and ensure that they will inherit the blessings of a rich, productive and unspoiled natural heritage. He has also said that improving the management of our nations wetlands, fisheries and ocean ecosystems will be one of his top priorities as president. Mr. McCain is not only a dedicated steward of our environment, he is also a steward of taxpayer dollars. Critical natural resources like the Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes and the Everglades stand to benefit greatly from Mr. McCains efforts to rein in unnecessary, and often environmentally destructive, pork-barrel spending and require independent review of water projects. This will mean that important water resource dollars currently being wasted on special-interest driven pet projects can be available for efforts that are clear national priorities, such as Chesapeake Bay restoration. Another hallmark of Mr. McCains approach to environmental policy is his commitment to making decisions based on sound science and facts, not on special-interest politics. Mr. McCains fight against the influence of special interests and his dedication to government transparency and accountability will be a great plus for efforts to safeguard our environment. The bay, like other marine environments, is coming under increasing pressure from the impacts of climate change. Addressing climate change and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels are important to the future health of the bay. The fact is, no member of Congress, Republican or Democrat, has done more to move this nation toward an effective response to global warming than Mr. McCain. Mr. McCain has done more than just say the right things, or vote the right way. He has exercised real leadership. Mr. McCain is one of the lead authors of the bipartisan Climate Stewardship Act, a cap-and-trade bill that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions 67 percent by 2050. This bill has been introduced since 2003 and Mr. McCain used the political capital necessary to secure votes on the bill in the face of opposition by his own party members. His leadership didnt stop there. To build support for climate legislation, Mr. McCain undertook an intensive effort to educate his colleagues in both the Senate and the House about climate change and mankinds role. He has taken skeptical senators and representatives to the ends of the earth, including Antarctica, Alaska, Greenland and New Zealand, to show them the impacts of global warming and change their minds on this issue. Mr. McCains long record of dedication to fighting climate change and his bipartisan approach offer the best opportunity for signing long-overdue climate legislation into law. People who care about the health of the bay and its fisheries should also be excited about Mr. McCains choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate. No state in the union does a better job of protecting its marine fisheries than her home state. Alaskas program is the example ocean advocates point to as the best model of fishery management. Mrs. Palin, herself a commercial and sport fisherman, has made fishery protection a priority. She developed a rigorous enforcement protocol to ensure that cruise ships, which are like small cities in their environmental footprint, obey a state law prohibiting the dumping of waste in state waters. You can be sure that a McCain-Palin administration will have the stewardship ethic and the experience to be a strong and effective advocate for the Chesapeake Bay and the people who depend on it. David Jenkins is the government affairs director for Republicans for Environmental Protection. He serves as National Coordinator of the Environmental Stewardship Coalition for McCain-Palin 2008.

34,"BISMARCK, N.D. -- From all appearances, Earl Pomeroy was the wrong guy at the wrong place in the wrong year - with the wrong message to deliver.\""Sometimes you look at Washington and only negative things come to mind,"" Pomeroy said in a speech to a coal executives last week. ""I want to give you some positive thoughts.""\Coming from a nine-term Democratic congressman in conservative North Dakota, kind words about Washington would seem to be political suicide. All things considered, Pomeroy should be a goner - and he may yet lose in November, when Republicans are expected to win dozens of Democrat-held seats.\But polls show him in a competitive race against challenger Rick Berg.\""We're still in this race,"" Pomeroy said.\Here, as well as in other pockets of the country, House Democrats in conservative-leaning districts have dug in, fought back and begun to reverse declining poll numbers and poor favorability ratings, developing what they believe are winning messages in a hostile political environment.\Cumulatively, their efforts could blunt some of the predicted GOP gains next month, Democrats hope, showing that even a powerful wave can run up against break walls.\""They've been able to get voters to focus on their own record, on how they're different from the national party,"" said Nathan Gonzales, an analyst for The Rothenberg Political Report.\The Dakotas, with a base of conservative, white voters inherently distrustful of the federal government, would seem an unlikely proving ground for Democratic hopes. But along with Pomeroy, Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin of South Dakota, another incumbent, now appears to have the wind at her back.\Other Democratic incumbents, such as Reps. Scott Murphy and Michael Arcuri in upstate New York and Dina Titus in Las Vegas, are first-termers who have shown staying power by staying locked on economic issues.\Elsewhere, lawmakers such as Reps. Bobby Bright of Alabama and Joe Donnelly of Indiana have distanced themselves from President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., at every opportunity in a bid to woo independents. Rep. Rick Boucher of Virginia, a 28-year veteran from coal country, is leading in his race despite taking an unpopular stand in favor of the so-called cap-and-trade climate bill.\Still others, such as Reps. Walt Minnick of Idaho and Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, appear to have an edge because they drew a tea party challenger instead of a more mainstream Republican, allowing them to capture support from moderate voters.\Murphy won a special election in 2009 in a moderate district in upstate New York - and then voted for both the cap-and-trade bill and the health care overhaul, which, according to the prevailing narrative of this election, should have doomed him.\Instead, Murphy is pulling away from his GOP challenger, Chris Gibson. A former venture capitalist, Murphy has focused on job creation. And like almost every Democrat in a difficult race, he's emphasized his independence from his party.\""Scott's background as a businessman gives him credibility on today's No. 1 issue, the economy,"" said spokesman Josh Schwerin, adding that Murphy visited all 137 towns in the district in his first year.\Murphy also has raised more than $5 million.\Indeed, many Democrats who are remaining competitive are doing so because they have the financial resources to combat not only their local GOP adversary but money from national third-party groups, which are spending millions this year pummeling Democrats on the airwaves.\For Boucher, a possible path to victory means pointing to his history of aiding economic development in his southwestern Virginia district, talking up his anti-health-care vote and deflecting criticism over the climate bill.\""It's not going to be a (Republican) wave. I've seen no signs of it,"" he said.\A year ago, that prediction would have seemed almost heretical. The same would be true for Herseth Sandlin, who was down in the polls to charismatic challenger Kristi Noem.\Herseth Sandlin, a moderate endorsed the National Rifle Association and who voted against both the health care and climate bills, has been painted by Noem as someone who hasn't done enough to rein in federal spending.\""She has not been a leader for South Dakota,"" says Noem. ""There's bad legislation that passed that needed to be stopped. She could have helped with that.""\But Noem has been upended by a different kind of local issue: her driving record. She's racked up a bevy of speeding tickets.\Herseth Sandlin, like Pomeroy, has benefited from the relatively strong economy in the Dakotas, which perhaps has put voters in a more forgiving mood.\Still, even if Democrats manage to stem their losses, with more than 70 seats in play, the GOP could easily secure the 40 it needs to regain control of the House.\But it that does not happen, races such as the one between Herseth Sandlin and Noem likely will be the reason.\Either way, said Noem, it's ""going to be a very tight, tough race.""\joliphant@tribune.com\Credit: Tribune Washington Bureau"
35,"An advisory panel appointed by Gov. Martin O'Malley is proposing that the state slash global warming pollution from Maryland by 90 percent by 2050 - one of the most ambitious goals in the country.\""The climate crisis is real, and while it threatens our shorelines today, its causes and symptoms threaten life on our planet in the generations ahead unless we act,"" O'Malley says in the report.\To reduce the amount of carbon dioxide pouring from power plants and other sources, Maryland should join other states in the region in creating a system of penalties and rewards to discourage pollution, according to an interim report of the 22-member Maryland Commission on Climate Change, which is led by O'Malley's Cabinet members.\Under the ""cap and trade"" system, the state would impose fees on companies that exceed the limits, with the money going to reward cleaner businesses.\State Environment Secretary Shari T. Wilson, who chaired the panel, said Maryland should also do more to encourage energy conservation and alternative energy sources, and do a better job of planning and managing growth, to reduce sprawl and the miles people have to drive.\And to limit damage to the state's shorelines from rising sea levels, Wilson said, the state should identify areas where developers should be required to build ""soft shorelines"" or artificial wetlands instead of rock walls.\""We will have to take a look at everything we do, in terms of state and local government action,"" to address the problem of global warming, Wilson said.\The panel was established after state lawmakers rejected a bill this year that would have required all businesses to cut emissions of global warming gases and legislation that would have forced all new state buildings to meet energy-efficient standards.\Among the concrete steps suggested in the report are that Maryland lawmakers follow California's example and pass a law requiring a 25 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020.\Some of the new recommendations will require approval from the General Assembly, which begins its regular session in January. Others can be implemented administratively.\The 61-page ""Climate Action Plan"" was released during a time of intense debate around the world over what government should do about climate change.\World leaders are meeting in Bali to discuss international efforts. And a U.S. Senate committee is scheduled today to debate amendments on a landmark bill proposed by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and John W. Warner of Virginia that would create a national ""cap and trade"" system to cut greenhouse-gas emissions.\In anticipation of a vote on that bill, environmental groups held a flurry of news conferences yesterday to press for action.\In Maryland, Wilson said she and the other members of the commission - which includes six lawmakers - will present their ideas to O'Malley and legislative leaders in the coming weeks.\It's not clear whether O'Malley will embrace the recommended steps or the goal of a 90 percent reduction by 2050, which is higher than the 80 percent cut adopted by California, Florida, New Jersey and Massachusetts, Wilson said.\""I haven't had a chance to brief him on it yet,"" said Wilson, who was appointed by O'Malley. ""But the governor has said that the time to act has passed and the time to catch up is now. ... He will be reviewing these to determine which of these [steps] he will embrace.""\Rick Abbruzzese, a spokesman for the Democratic governor, said O'Malley will study the report and have more to say on what he'll do. ""The goals are ambitious and would put Maryland at the forefront on some of these issues,"" Abbruzzese said. ""But the goals are also science-based. ""\Frank Maisano, a lobbyist who represents power companies and wind farm developers, questioned the feasibility of a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\""That is an awfully aggressive goal for what we know to be technologically feasible,"" Maisano said. ""The rhetoric has to match up with the reality. I hope they're not biting off more than they can chew.""\Maisano pointed out that Maryland passed a renewable-energy law a few years ago to encourage wind power and other clean energy sources, but no wind farms have been built here.\Meantime, many environmentalists praised the goals. ""This forward-thinking report is a fantastic first step in confronting the issue of catastrophic climate change,"" said Claire Douglass, a coordinator for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.\Others said the report lacks concrete recommendations for transportation, as the state moves forward with the Intercounty Connector highway project in the Washington suburbs, which some fear could bring more pollution.\""The targets are impressive, but the urgency of climate change requires we ensure that strong, achievable goals are matched with specific plans that can actually be implemented,"" said Dave O'Leary, energy chairman for the Maryland Sierra Club.\tom.pelton@baltsun.com\Sun reporter Timothy B.

36,"
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) - A federal appeals court said yesterday the Bush administration ignored the law when it imposed less stringent requirements on power plants to reduce mercury pollution, which scientists fear could cause neurological problems in 60,000 newborns a year.
\
A three-judge panel unanimously struck down a mercury-control plan imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency three years ago. It established an emissions trading process in which some plants could avoid installing the best mercury control technology available by buying pollution credits.
\
Environmentalist and health experts argued that such a cap-and- trading mechanism would create ""hot spots"" of mercury contamination near some power plants. Maryland and 16 states as well as environmental and health groups joined in a suit to block the regulation, saying it did not adequately protect public health.
\
Power plants are the biggest source of releases of mercury, which finds its way into the food supply, particularly fish. Mercury can damage developing brains of fetuses and very young children.
\
The court decision was the latest in a string of judicial rebukes of the Bush administration's environmental policies. The Supreme Court last year took the administration to task for not regulating greenhouse gases. Courts have also rejected administration attempts to overhaul federal forest policies and streamline fuel economy standards for small trucks.
\
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that the EPA violated the federal Clean Air Act when it scrapped a mercury-control policy established in December 2000 under the Clinton administration. Utilities were required to install the best available technology to capture mercury from power-plant smokestacks.
\
That policy was anticipated to capture more than 90 percent of mercury releases. The cap-and-trade approach imposed by the EPA in March 2005 envisioned capturing 70 percent of emissions by 2018.
\
The court held that the EPA failed to show that its new approach would not harm the environment or that emissions at all plants not ""exceed a level which is adequate to protect public health with an ample margin of safety.""
\
""This three-judge panel has done the world a favor and helped save lives,"" said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, whose state participated in the lawsuit.
\
EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said the agency was reviewing the decision, but he indicated it was not giving up on the cap-and- trade approach to reducing mercury.
\
Environmentalists, hailing the decision as a victory for public health, predicted it will require the EPA to issue the more stringent emissions requirements that were proposed eight years ago. {Corrections:} {Status:}

37,"
The leading candidates for governor are promising to make restoring the health of the Chesapeake Bay a priority.
\
Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. have each spent four years in the Governor's Mansion and tout their accomplishments in reducing pollution, boosting fisheries and promoting clean energy.
\
It's not clear, however, whether the environment will influence many voters on Election Day.
\
While most candidates and Marylanders profess an interest in the environment, it can be dwarfed by issues such as the economy and unemployment.
\
Ehrlich, a Republican, said that environmental issues are ""exciting and important"" he likes talking about them, but in reality, ""In this economy, in this state, it's all about jobs.""
\
O'Malley, a Democrat, also acknowledges that the economy is the top issue in this election.
\
But he thinks he's picked up votes based on his environmental record. He's won endorsements from environmental groups such as the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club.
\
""I do think we are winning people over. The differences in our records are so stark and so great that it's a hard one to miss,"" he said.
\
Not so fast, says Howard Ernst, a bay author who teaches political science at the Naval Academy.
\
""In order for the environment to be a substantial electoral factor, voters have to perceive a clear distinction between the competing candidates,"" Ernst said. ""The reality is that the actual environmental differences between Martin O'Malley and Robert Ehrlich are fairly minor when compared to the environmental differences between rival candidates in many other states.""
\
Both men can claim environmental victories, but O'Malley made significant budget cuts to the environment and Ehrlich perhaps could have done more considering he was governor during a more robust economy, Ernst said.
\
""Neither of these candidates owns the issue,"" said Ernst, who is not supporting either candidate.
\
Different ideas
\
Beyond their similar declared passion for the bay, the two men have divergent strategies for helping the bay.
\
O'Malley promises to continue his BayStat-influenced management of the environment, even if it means taking unpopular actions such as restricting watermen. He pledges aggressive actions to comply with the new federal ""pollution diet"" for the bay.
\
Ehrlich favors a collaborative approach to restoring the bay, saying that he wants to make sure that local and on-the-ground programs don't get swept away as the bay cleanup effort changes. He says he may revisit the O'Malley administration's pollution diet plan if re-elected.
\
Also running for governor this year are Susan J. Gaztanaga of the Libertarian Party, Maria Allwine of the Green Party and Eric Delano Knowles of the Constitution Party.
\
Here's how Ehrlich and O'Malley - who are leading the race - stack up on key environmental issues.
\
Top initiatives
\
When it comes to his top environmental accomplishment, Ehrlich points with pride to the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act.
\
The bill, passed in 2004, created the $30 annual ""flush fee"" paid by all Marylanders. The money, which is collected through sewer or property tax bills, pays for modernizing sewage plants, upgrading septic systems and planting winter cover crops on farms.
\
Ehrlich is frustrated that O'Malley's supporters, on one hand, praise his Bay Restoration Fund and then criticize him for raising fees during his administration.
\
Environmentalists and even O'Malley acknowledge that the flush fee has resulted in significant pollution reductions and will continue to do so for years to come.
\
During a debate in Washington last week, when the candidates were asked to say something nice about one another, O'Malley praised Ehrlich's flush fee.
\
O'Malley, on the other hand, says his top accomplishment is instituting crabbing restrictions and a resulting rebound of the blue crab population.
\
""The crab population was in danger of totally imploding and now it's roaring back stronger than the most optimistic scientists would ever have predicted,"" O'Malley said.
\
Watermen, however, remain miffed about the restrictions. And some scientists have said it's too early to tell how much the regulations helped. They say it's possible that weather or other factors in nature could be contributing to the crab population boost, too.
\
Pollution 'diet'
\
The biggest environmental issue facing the next governor is the new federal ""pollution diet.""
\
The diet sets limits on how much nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment pollution can reach the bay and its rivers. If states don't comply with the diet, they could face federal sanctions.
\
O'Malley has pledged to meet the federal diet numbers and to do it a few years early. His staff listed dozens of pollution-reducing actions that might be necessary, but they haven't said yet how much it will cost or whether they can get lawmakers to pass tough regulations.
\
O'Malley takes some credit for getting other bay-area governors to agree to two-year milestones for reducing pollution, in addition to the new overall goal of cleaning up the bay by 2025.
\
O'Malley said he's told people that the pollution diet - officially called a Total Maximum Daily Load, or TMDL - will be tough, but it's necessary.
\
""We can complain about these TMDLs all we want, but they're not going away,"" he said.
\
Ehrlich is not totally on board with the pollution diet. He says he favors a cooperative approach among the feds, states and others. ""I'm not a fan of federal pre-emption and that's been my view ... I get very concerned about property rights, I get concerned about the good things that are working at the local and state level when the feds come in. The feds don't exactly have a great record in this regard.""
\
Ehrlich said he'll consider revisiting the O'Malley cleanup plans, which are being worked into the pollution diet, which will be finalized by the end of the year.
\
Climate change
\
When it comes to climate change, Ehrlich told The Baltimore Sun that ""the skeptical side of me has increased.""
\
He's not as convinced that human actions are contributing to changes in the climate such as global warming.
\
Still, Ehrlich supports alternative energy such as wind power and solar power.
\
""Where it works, where it makes sense, I'm supportive,"" he said.
\
O'Malley, on the other hand, is a firm believer in human-caused climate change.
\
""One of the big differences between myself and the former Gov. Ehrlich is that he's a climate change doubter, to put it kindly ... I accept the science of 99.9 percent of the world's scientists that the climate is changing and it is due to the energy we use,"" O'Malley said.
\
Maryland participates in a regional carbon dioxide cap-and-trade program that forces polluters to pay for credits. The money goes back to the state for energy efficiency and energy assistance programs.
\
The state joined the program, called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, as the result of the Healthy Air Act, which Ehrlich reluctantly signed in 2006.
\
But before Ehrlich had signed that bill, his administration actively campaigned against it. And two years earlier, he declined to have Maryland voluntarily join the cap-and-trade program and brushed off criticism from groups ""on the fringe left.""
\
Open space
\
Both candidates pledge to preserve undeveloped land.
\
Ehrlich's campaign materials promote that he wants to make sure land has ecological value, and not buy land that doesn't help the bay.
\
Ehrlich didn't win many points from environmentalists on the land preservation front when he was in office.
\
He diverted money from Program Open Space to fill budget holes, and he also was criticized for a deal to sell preserved land to a politically-connected developer.
\
O'Malley, too, looked to Program Open Space during tight financial times.
\
He moved some cash out of the program and replaced it with buying bonds to pay for land preservation, which makes land purchases more expensive in the long run.
\
""While it is true ... that we shifted it to bond dollars, the level of effort never diminished,"" O'Malley said.
\
O'Malley claims to have bought four times more land for preservation than Ehrlich did.
\
Fish, crabs, oysters
\
O'Malley and Ehrlich also both say they'll find effective ways to manage the state's fish, crabs and oysters while keeping watermen in business and recreational anglers happy.
\
O'Malley said he's willing to make tough choices - such as the crabs, and with the new oyster plan he put in place this year. His proposals are based on science, he said.
\
Ehrlich said he'll consult scientists as well as watermen, who he says have been marginalized.
\
""They know the science, they live this stuff,"" Ehrlich said of watermen.
\
He said he'll listen to environmentalists, but won't be captive to them.
\
O'Malley admits that his crabbing and oystering rules have not been popular, but he thinks some watermen are changing their minds, now that they see the crab population rebound.

38,"
State lawmakers will debate spending priorities, gay marriage and the death penalty during what's expected to be a very busy 90-day session starting Wednesday.
\
But they're also expected to make room for key environmental issues, such as putting more money into Chesapeake Bay restoration, reforming Critical Area laws, dealing with global warming and preserving forests.
\
Though 2007 generally was considered a good year for ""green"" causes in Annapolis - passing bills to lower car emissions, boost oysters and protect terrapins - environmental lobbyists aren't resting easy.
\
""I think there is a sense there's a lot of unfinished business,"" said Brad Heavner, director of the advocacy group Environment Maryland.
\
Kim Coble, Maryland director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the 2008 proposals are evidence that the state is moving from talking to acting.
\
""Instead of having to legislate that we have to do something to clean up our air or clean up our bay, the discussion and the legislation is about how we're going to do it,"" she said.
\
Gov. Martin O'Malley hasn't yet revealed which environmental issues he'll support, but spokesman Rick Abbruzzese said the environment will be a focus for the governor.
\
""It will be a big issue during the upcoming session,"" he said.
\
Climate change
\
For the second year, advocates and a group of lawmakers will promote a bill requiring a cutback in Maryland's emissions of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.
\
In 2007, the Global Warming Solutions Act didn't go anywhere, but activists chalked that up to the need to educate lawmakers and get people talking.
\
The bill will set yet-to-be-decided goals for reductions tied to certain years.
\
The bill could include recommendations from a gubernatorial commission that called for a 25 to 50 percent reduction from 2006 levels by 2020.
\
The bill would give wide latitude to the Maryland Department of the Environment to set up programs to make the reductions. A likely component would be a ""cap and trade"" system for major emitters such as power plants.
\
In general, each emitter would be given a certain cap on emissions. If a plant goes under the cap, it could sell credits to plants having trouble reaching their cap.
\
Opponents, however, say that one small state can't make a difference in what is a global problem.
\
""People fail to recognize Maryland is a little state and the truth is nothing we do in this state - that we do alone or with a couple other states - is going to make any difference with global warming,"" said Michael Powell, a lobbyist whose clients include manufacturers and energy companies.
\
He said national action is required. And he cautioned that strict regulations could harm businesses that already are trying hard to cut energy use.
\
Claire Douglass, an organizer with the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, is ready to rebuff those arguments. She said other state's could follow Maryland's lead.
\
""We have an excellent opportunity to be a national leader,"" she said.
\
Advocates are optimistic about the bill's chances - especially if it gets assigned to the friendly venue of the environment committees, rather than the committees that handle business regulation.
\
Del. Kumar Barve, the House majority leader, likely will be one of the lead sponsors of the climate change bill.
\
""I think we've hit a psychological tipping point,"" said Mr. Barve, D-Montgomery. ""I think people understand greenhouse gas emissions are causing climate change and climate change is a significant issue we have to deal with sooner rather than later. Public perception has changed significantly on this issue.""
\
Climate change activists will hold a rally in Annapolis on Jan. 17 to draw attention to their cause - the same day that business groups will be lobbying lawmakers as well.
\
The climate activists also support bills that promote energy efficiency and renewable energy.
\
Bay money
\
Lawmakers also will deal with an issue left over from the November special session when they raised taxes to fill holes in the budget.
\
Lawmakers set aside $50 million in new money for restoring the Chesapeake Bay - but they didn't say how to spend it.
\
""We got the $50 million allocated, which was great,"" said Ms. Coble of the bay foundation. ""We would like a little more definitive explanation on how it will be spent.""
\
During the special session, there was talk of splitting the money among different practices, such as planting oysters, farm pollution controls and managing stormwater.
\
There also was discussion of giving the governor latitude to spend it differently each year, based on needs identified through his BayStat program.
\
Ms. Coble said the spending needs to be carefully targeted to get the best benefit for the bay.
\
""I think it's important at this point in time we look at the results we want to achieve, rather than this practice or that practice,"" she said.
\
Critical Areas
\
Lawmakers also likely will consider reforming the state's Critical Area laws, which limit development on land closest to the bays and its rivers.
\
But critics argue that it isn't working, citing examples such as the infamous case of Little Island in the Magothy River, where a home was built without a single permit - let alone Critical Area approval.
\
Reforms could stall, however, if common ground isn't found among lawmakers, environmentalists and the cities and counties that are generally responsible for enforcing the Critical Area laws.
\
""It's just obvious that law needs to be fixed,"" said Mr. Heavner of Environment Maryland. ""I hope this is one where everyone lines up and the General Assembly does something sensible.""
\
Ms. Coble of the bay foundation said the reforms could include making it easier to punish violators, updating the shoreline maps and giving the state Critical Areas Commission more power. The reforms also might require local governments look at the cumulative effect of all the approvals they grant for building in the Critical Area - rather than looking at each case on its own.
\
""There's been a little tweak here and a little tweak there. It's time to make it more effective,"" she said.
\
Saving forests
\
Lastly, a bill is in the works aimed at keeping the state's privately-owned forests from being bulldozed and turned into housing developments.
\
Like the other issues, the details still are being worked out.
\
Gary Allen of the Partnership for Sustainable Forestry expects a consensus to be reached in the coming weeks.
\
The goal, he said, is to provide incentives for landowners who engage in ""sustainable"" forestry - essentially, balancing economic benefits and environmental benefits. For example, that could mean cutting down a certain amount of timber, but leaving a specified amount of forest untouched.
\
If forest owners can make some money off their land, then they'll be less likely to sell out to developers, he said.
\
""What we want to prevent is what are called 'terminal harvests,' that is, further loss of forest ... After that, all you plant on it is buildings,"" Mr. Allen said.
\
Forests are an important part of helping the environment, as they suck up carbon dioxide that contributes to global warming and they slow down stormwater runoff that harms the Chesapeake Bay.
\
The traditional environment groups are joining with the forest industry groups in promoting the issue.
\
""We've lost so much forest,"" Mr. Heavner said. ""It's time to end that.""
"
39,"A pioneering regional compact to fight climate change stands at a crossroads, as officials from Maryland and eight other Northeastern states met Tuesday in New York to weigh new limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.\With emissions cut significantly since the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative began in 2008 -- mainly through other factors -- the states are weighing how much more carbon dioxide releases could be reduced without risking the fragile economic recovery. \""We're here to set a reasonable cap,"" said Robert M. Summers, Maryland's environment secretary, on the eve of the gathering. He said he hoped that the group would settle on an emissions ceiling that would lead to further reductions without a ""major price impact"" on electricity rates. \A spokesman for the nation's first market-based climate regulatory program said no decision was expected from Tuesday's meeting, though Summers said he hoped that the group could get close to an agreement that could be finalized in coming weeks. After the meeting, Summers reported that a draft proposal would be prepared and released by the end of January. \Any new limit settled upon is intended to go into effect at the beginning of 2014, to give states time to adjust regulations. \Environmental groups are urging the states to set a cap that would reduce emissions further, arguing that the results to date show that can be achieved without triggering significant increases in electricity rates that might hurt the economy. \Emissions are on track to fall as much as 45 percent below the cap set by the group for this year, even as electricity prices have declined 10 percent since the initiative began, according to a report issued Monday by Environment Northeast, a Maine-based environmental group. \A variety of factors, including switching power plants to cleaner-burning natural gas from coal and oil, increases in renewable energy and improved efficiency, caused the decline, the report says. The nation's economic woes also played a role in reducing emissions, though not a major one, according to the report. \Analyses have indicated that the regulatory program has been a net benefit for the economy because of revenue generated by the auctions of carbon dioxide emissions allowances. \The cap-and-trade program, under which power plants are required to buy allowances at auction to offset their carbon dioxide emissions, has been touted as a national model for reducing the energy sector's effect on climate change. Though Congress failed to pass climate legislation a few years ago, the Environmental Protection Agency could move to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. California recently launched a similar regulatory scheme. \""In a way, what RGGI states decide will have national and even broader impact,"" said Peter Shattuck, Environment Northeast's director of market initiatives. \But Shattuck expressed concern that representatives of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont might fail to reduce or even hold the line on emissions unless they set tight new limits. Three of four cap proposals analyzed so far would allow emissions to increase, he said, while only one would likely lead to a small reduction through 2020. \The emissions cap originally set by the initiative was so loose that it allowed power plants to buy allowances relatively cheaply and bank them for future needs, Shattuck said, and unless the new cap is set at or below the current level of overall emissions of about 91 million tons this year, energy companies might be able to use those reserved allowances to increase emissions in future years. \Summers said the states' representatives are aware of those issues and weighing options for dealing with them. He said that with emissions now well below the cap, carbon dioxide allowances are selling for minimal prices and not all the allowances are being put up for auction. But state representatives are wary of doing anything that would push energy prices significantly higher and affect economic activity, Summers added. \""We want a meaningful cap,""' he said, noting that Maryland lawmakers, at the behest of Gov. Martin O'Malley, have committed the state to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by the end of the decade. The regional program to regulate power plants is expected to play a major role in the state meeting its emissions goals, since whatever cap is set is supposed to decline by 10 percent by 2020. \The auctions of carbon dioxide allowances have raised $1 billion for the states through June of this year, and that money has largely been plowed into improving energy efficiency or developing renewable energy. Maryland has reaped more than $219 million, though much of that until lately has been used to reduce consumers' power bills -- a move that some have criticized as counterproductive to promoting energy conservation. \tim.wheeler@baltsun.com\Credit: The Baltimore Sun"
40,"EUGENE, Ore. - Cap and trade"" is the rage today as a primary solution to global warming. But the European Union's struggle with this approach indicates it has an uncertain future. This is because global warming, at its core, is not a technology or policy problem. Rather, it is a failure of thought - perhaps the greatest such failure in human history. Attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will fail unless people first alter their thinking and behavior.\Earth is warming because humans, primarily in industrialized nations, suffer from ""systems blindness."" We have failed to recognize the effects of our insatiable use of fossil fuels, massive resource consumption and huge emission of waste, including greenhouse gases, on the ecological and social systems we depend on for life. Overcoming systems blindness requires a shift to what can be called ""sustainable thinking."" A growing number of private and public organizations and everyday citizens have shown that it is possible to think sustainably. They use a four-step process: discover, dream, design and act.\Their first step is to discover the greenhouse gas emissions produced through all aspects of their activities. They start by assessing the emissions directly produced through their home and business energy use, travel and waste. They then identify the emissions they create indirectly, including those generated throughout the entire life-cycle of the goods and services, including food, purchased or used. Discovery is often a life-changing experience. People become aware of the profound impacts of their activities.\Albuquerque, N.M., and Portland, Ore., have completed greenhouse gas ""inventories"" of the amount and sources of emissions generated directly through internal city operations and by the broader community. Some cities have begun to assess the emissions from products manufactured elsewhere that are used locally. Xerox and DuPont are just two of the many private companies that use ""life-cycle assessments"" to quantify their carbon footprint. Regular people are also doing it, such as those that attend the ""climate master"" program developed by my organization at the University of Oregon. Through this 10-week program, participants are taught how to think systemically and discover the full range of their emissions.\Last week, the Maryland Department of Environment hosted a meeting attended by the city of Gaithersburg, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, the Maryland Science Center, the University of Maryland, the Baltimore Climate Action Network and many others to discuss launching local climate master programs. Based on the enthusiasm shown there, it seems likely that programs will soon begin.\The next step is to dream of new ways to decrease your carbon footprint. Dreaming starts by envisioning how an ideal low-carbon or carbon-free condition would look and function.\Dreaming leads to the design stage, where innovative ways of achieving the ideal are planned. Albuquerque established the nation's first municipal capital budget set-aside specifically dedicated to energy reduction and renewable energy projects. Portland developed a climate action plan through extensive community involvement. Xerox established ""Energy Challenge 2012"" that involves the entire company, engages its full business value chain and integrates climate protection into core business strategies and practices.\The last stage is acting. Start by increasing energy conservation and efficiency. Make behavioral changes such as routinely turning off unused lights, TVs and computers. Add extra building insulation. Use public transportation or walk more. Install green technologies, from compact fluorescent bulbs to more efficient motors. After all efficiencies have been captured, shift to renewable energy. In Portland, more than 40 high-performance green buildings have been constructed and over 10,000 multifamily units and 800 homes have been weatherized. Albuquerque gets 20 percent of its energy from wind power.\Thinking sustainably produces impressive results. Emissions from city operations in Albuquerque have been reduced by 58 percent, Portland's have dropped 16 percent since 1990, Xerox's by 18 percent through 2006, and DuPont's by 67 percent. Climate masters slashed emissions by an average of two tons per person, a 23 percent cut from the local per capita emission rate of 8.6 tons per person.\Hundreds of other organizations are beginning to think sustainably. Florida, for example, recently completed a statewide emissions assessment. More than 850 mayors have signed the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement that, among other actions, commits cities to inventory their emissions. IBM and Bayer have each reduced emissions by at least 60 percent since the early 1990s, collectively saving more than $4 billion in the process.\Stabilizing the climate will ultimately require an 80 percent cut in emissions, so emissions trading and many other reduction strategies will be needed. But no matter what the approach, the pioneers have shown that success ultimately depends on overcoming systems blindness and thinking sustainably.\Bob Doppelt is director of the Climate Leadership Initiative at the University of Oregon and the author of ""The Power of Sustainable Thinking: How to Create a Positive Future for the Climate, the Planet, Your Organization and Your Life.""

A proposal to cap Maryland's greenhouse gas emissions may have the support of the governor, but it's still not clear whether the measure will survive the General Assembly.
\
The bill - called the Global Warming Solutions Act - got its first public airing yesterday during a Senate committee hearing.
\
And while officials representing Gov. Martin O'Malley's administration, scientists and environmentalists support the bill, there was plenty of opposition from business and industrial groups.
\
The Global Warming Solutions Act would require the state to reduce its overall greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent of 2006 levels by 2020 and by 90 percent by 2050.
\
There are several greenhouse gases that cause global warming; however, the main focus is usually on carbon dioxide.
\
The initial version of the bill would set up a cap-and-trade program for major emitters, such as power plants, where they could buy and sell pollution credits. Other ways to reduce emissions would be determined by the Maryland Department of the Environment.
\
The O'Malley administration has suggested a change, however, that would make the cap-and-trade not mandatory; rather, it would be one of many programs MDE could implement.
\
Maryland already is setting up a smaller-scale cap-and-trade program for power plants as part of the Healthy Air Act passed two years ago, which requires a 10 percent cut in carbon dioxide from those plants.
\
During yesterday's three-hour hearing, both sides repeated the same arguments they've used in the past.
\
The proponents said global warming is a pressing problem. They said while Maryland's impact on the global problem may be small, its symbolism is huge.
\
And they professed that any cost of reducing emissions would be offset by cost savings from reducing energy use.
\
They pointed out that Maryland is considered the third most vulnerable state to climate change, behind only Louisiana and Florida.
\
Maryland has the added problem that its land is sinking. When the land subsidence is combined with sea-level rise from global warming, Maryland has seen a one-foot relative rise in the past 100 years.
\
The next century could mean a relative rise of two more feet if greenhouse-gas emissions are curbed - four feet if no action is taken.
\
Sen. Paul G. Pinsky, D-Prince George's, said action now is needed to preserve the state's future.
\
""Doing nothing will cost us a lot more,"" said Mr. Pinsky, who is the lead sponsor of the bill in the Senate.
\
On the flip side, business representatives repeated their warnings that the measure could be bad news for Maryland's economy.
\
For example, lobbyists for Mittal Steel and unions said the venerable steel mill at Sparrows Point in Baltimore County could fold if required to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. They said the mill is a major source of carbon-dioxide emissions.
\
There also were pleas to kill the bill from power companies, a western Maryland paper mill and an employee from the Domino Sugar plant in Baltimore.
\
House Speaker Michael E. Busch and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. - who have the power to make or break legislation - have expressed concerns about the bill.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Political Notes is a periodic compilation of political news items.
\
A former state delegate and Calvert County Democrat appears ready to announce a challenge to Gov. Martin O'Malley in the gubernatorial primary.
\
George W. Owings III said Monday that he'll ""make it official"" at a news conference on the courthouse steps in Prince Frederick on Jan. 6.
\
The former majority whip served as secretary of veterans affairs under Republican Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. He has been a sharp critic of O'Malley's fiscal policies, disagreeing with O'Malley's decision to raise the sales tax during a 2007 special session.
\
Owings also took issue with the governor's personal lobbying to repeal the death penalty this year.
\
Making the grade
\
Most of Maryland's congressmen and senators finished at the top in a ranking of lawmakers by the advocacy group Environment America.
\
Environment America - which is a confederation of 28 state-level organizations such as Environment Maryland - graded federal lawmakers on how they voted on key environmental issues that were considered between May 2007 and September 2009.
\
Nationally, 40 senators and 144 representatives aligned with Environment America's positions on the bills 100 percent of the time.
\
Maryland had several politicians in that group, all Democrats: Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Benjamin L. Cardin, and Reps. Elijah Cummings, Donna Edwards, Steny Hoyer, C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes and Chris Van Hollen.
\
Rep. Frank Kratovil, a Democrat on the Eastern Shore, scored 67 percent. Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, the lone Republican from Maryland, scored a 20 percent.
\
None of Maryland's representatives ended up on Environment America's ""natural disasters"" list of 26 senators and 17 representatives who voted opposite of the group 100 percent of the time.
\
Kratovil and Edwards were graded on fewer issues than the others because they were not in office yet when some of the votes were taken.
\
Some of the positions favored by Environment America included starting a cap-and-trade program to fight global warming, boosting incentives for clean energy, blocking new offshore drilling for oil, protecting wilderness and promoting environmental education for schoolchildren.

43,"Let us begin today with full disclosure: For those who don't know my position on global warming alarmism and its insidious uses, it is that this phenomenon is the greatest hoax in modern times and is being used to achieve things - bad things - quite apart from its ostensible goal of ""saving the planet."" Al Gore wanders the spheroid he is determined to save, spouting increasingly inane observations as his bank account grows and his ""carbon footprint"" becomes ever more Godzilla-like, considering all the jet fuel burned as he hurtles from appearance to appearance. I have read that his speaking fee is now $175,000 a pop, a fee for which his audiences are fed what seems to me to be an amazing concoction of lies, distortions and flights of fancy.\The other day, in a speech given in Oxford before the Smith School World Forum on Enterprise and the Environment, the former American vice president, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and Oscar winner likened the battle against what he now calls climate change (perhaps because the globe is no longer warming and lots of people are aware of that) to the fight decades ago against the Nazis.\No, I'm not kidding: The man stood there and said his cause is one that can rightly be compared to fighting Nazism and its systematic extermination of Europe's Jews and other untermenschen. He urged British leaders to heed the example of Winston Churchill, who ""aroused this nation in heroic fashion to save civilization in World War Two.""\Ah, to fight so heroically for all of humanity is such an admirable thing, eh? Think about it. Here's a man who is founder and chairman of the Alliance for Climate Protection, which is so devoted to its mission that it is spending a reported $300 million in advertising to pressure politicians into doing right by the greenies. At the same time, Mr. Gore is also chairman of something called Generation Investment Management, which stands to profit mightily from the actions of governments that succumb to the pressure from the other group he heads. Nice work there. One hand washes the other, and those in the in-crowd divvy up lots of money.\Overseas, climate change was the top issue at the opening of the Group of 8 summit in Italy this week, while here at home the Obama administration, the Democratic Congress and their news media propagandists are prepping us for a huge and regressive tax increase masquerading as an environmental measure. It's the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, aka the American Clean Energy and Security Act, which passed the House late last month. If we're lucky, the miserable legislation will be killed in the Senate, but it's more likely that some version of it will spring into life to do its damage to us under the guise of saving the planet and making us energy independent - which, in case you don't know, isn't possible in the real world.\On Tuesday, I talked with California Republican Rep. Tom McClintock, who stood on the floor of the House June 26 and warned us all of what lies ahead if this measure makes it into law. ""I had a strange sense of d?j? vu as I watched the self-congratulatory rhetoric on the house floor tonight,"" he said. ""Three years ago, I stood on the floor of the California Senate and watched a similar celebration over a similar bill. ... And I have spent the last three years watching as the law has dangerously deepened California's recession."" (To get the details of his warning from the left coast, you can listen to my interview with Mr. McClintock by going to my page at wbal.com.)\I mentioned that the ostensible purposes of climate change alarmism are quite apart from the actual goals, which are increasing the power of global government over the masses by implementing international socialism, resulting in what writer Brendan O'Neill calls ""the new Green-Industrial Complex,"" which would control the world economy. This is power beyond compare - and we all know what happens when an elite seizes total power, don't we?\Ron Smith can be heard weekdays, 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., on 1090 WBAL-AM and WBAL.com.

The debate over battling global warming is becoming a business vs. business affair.
\
During a hearing and a press conference about global warming legislation yesterday, businesses offered competing views of how the economy would be affected.
\
Traditional business groups, power companies and manufacturers said they would be harmed by the legislation, which would require the state as a whole to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020 and by 90 percent by 2050.
\
During a joint hearing in Annapolis before the state General Assembly's House Environmental Matters Committee and the House Economic Matters Committee, they spoke of companies like a steel mill, a paper factory, brick factory and power plants that might lose jobs or go out of businesses if they're forced to reduce carbon dioxide. That's because there's no sure-fire way yet to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from smokestacks.
\
And they argued that one small state would make little difference in the global problem of climate change.
\
""Nothing you do with this bill today will make any difference in global warming ... You could cut off every plant in Maryland and you will make no difference,"" said Michael Powell, a lobbyist representing the Maryland Industrial and Technology Alliance.
\
However, supporters of the bill titled the Global Warming Solutions Act, tried to swing the business angle in their favor.
\
Environmentalists held a press conference with several businesses supporting the bill, including companies focusing on energy efficiency and ""green"" technology.
\
They displayed posters listing several hundred more businesses in support - although many of the businesses appear to be small firms and none are among the state's major carbon dioxide emitters.
\
""All of these people came to the table because they want to be more responsible,"" said Keith Losoya, founder of the Chesapeake Sustainable Business Alliance. Mr. Losoya said he founded the group because he felt his pro-environment interests weren't being represented well by traditional business groups.
\
The bill being considered would require the state Department of the Environment to come up with a plan to meet the emissions goals.
\
One option that was mandatory in the original version of the bill - a cap-and-trade emissions program for major emissions sources - would become optional under a key amendment. A smaller cap-and-trade program is already in the works for coal-burning power plants. Another amendment would get rid of a plan to create a state Office of Climate Change. That would cut the taxpayers' cost for the bill from about $2 million to less than $1 million, lawmakers said.
\
Unlike a Senate hearing last week when no one debated the existence of human-caused global warming, there were several questions from lawmakers along those lines yesterday, primarily from Del. Richard A. Sossi, R-Queen Anne's, and Del. Joseph C. Boteler III, R-Baltimore County. Mr. Sossi said he wanted to make sure that Marylanders don't ""pay more money to get rid of a gas that may or may not have an effect.""

As President Barack Obama and other world leaders prepare to meet next week to talk about climate change, local advocates and experts are praising Maryland's efforts to combat global warming.
\
Maryland is a leader in reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause global warming, according to a new report issued by Environment America, the parent organization for state advocacy groups such as Environment Maryland.
\
By 2020, Maryland is expected to cut 46.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide - second only to the state of California and outpacing much larger states.
\
""Maryland has been a true leader on this issue,"" said Brad Heavner, director of Environment Maryland.
\
The report comes on the eve of an important summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, where leaders will develop new plans for reducing greenhouse gases in order to blunt the most harmful effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels. Obama has promised that America can cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent.
\
The report also comes at a time when surveys show more Americans are becoming doubtful about the human impact on global warming and the need to crack down on greenhouse gas emissions.
\
A Harris Interactive poll released earlier this week showed 51 percent of Americans think greenhouse gases will cause warming, down from 71 percent two years ago.
\
Greenhouse gases are so named because when they reach high concentrations in the atmosphere, they trap the sun's rays and cause warming, much like a greenhouse.
\
Scientists generally agree that human sources of greenhouse gases are a significant contributor to global warming. Key human sources include emissions from burning fossil fuels to power our vehicles and create electricity at power plants, as well as industrial emissions.
\
Actions already taken by Maryland and other states will result in a 7 percent drop in America's total greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. The total amount of the drop is 536 million metric tons.
\
The activity by state governments ""shows that the nation is ready to commit to the emission reductions science tells us are necessary to prevent the worst impacts of global warming,"" stated the report, which is titled ""America on the Move.""
\
Maryland's steps include: setting a cap on greenhouse gases, joining a regional carbon cap-and-trade program, promising to adopt stricter vehicle emissions rules, requiring utility companies to have a certain percent of electricity from renewable sources (such as wind or solar), and encouraging energy efficiency.
\
Most of Maryland's actions came as a result of bills passed by the General Assembly, though there has been vocal opposition from some lawmakers, especially those concerned about the policies triggering negative economic effects.
\
Del. James W. Hubbard, D-Prince George's, who sponsored many of the bills, said lawmakers were trying to be ""progressive"" and ""innovative.""
\
""We knew at some point down the line, these reductions would have an impact,"" he said.

46,"COCKEYSVILLE, Md. -- For 12 years, Andy Harris has balanced the demands of working as an anesthesiologist at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and serving as a senator in the Maryland General Assembly.\His life is about to change dramatically.\On Jan. 3, Harris will be sworn into the nation's 112th Congress as a representative for Maryland's 1st District. Harris ousted Democratic freshman Rep. Frank Kratovil in a rematch of their 2008 race, and with his victory will serve a 12-county district that spans the Eastern Shore.\Harris said Congress, unlike Maryland's part-time legislature, which convenes for three months, won't leave him much time for practicing medicine. That's an adjustment for Harris, a physician who for the past 26 years has donned operating room scrubs and administered pain relief treatments and sedation for patients.\Harris, a former chief of obstetric anesthesiology at Johns Hopkins University, said he especially enjoys working in the delivery room.\""I will miss it. I really do enjoy taking care of patients. It's an incredible privilege for people to entrust their lives to me for a few hours,"" Harris said.\The past week was a busy one for Harris, who joined new lawmakers in Washington for an orientation session. He is one of at least 94 new House members, the largest freshman class since 1992.\""I think when people look back on the Class of 2010, they will look back on it as the class that changed the way Washington did business,"" he said.\A seat at the energy, health care table\Harris said his top choice for a committee appointment is on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\Historically, few freshmen have served on the committee. But Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, the ranking member of the committee, said he wants new lawmakers on the committee and will ask House Speaker-in-waiting John Boehner and GOP leadership for their support.\Established in 1795, Energy and Commerce is one of the oldest standing committees in the House. It has jurisdiction over national energy policy, public health, interstate and foreign commerce, biomedical research and travel and tourism, among other areas.\The committee would be an influential perch for Harris, who vowed during his campaign to seek the repeal of the health care reform law, which he's derided as ""ObamaCare."" Harris also said cap-and-trade -- which has passed the House, but not the Senate -- is job-killing legislation.\Those views seem in line with the agenda Barton has for the committee, which he outlined in a news release this week.\""In short, the Energy and Commerce Committee will be the front lines in the battle to repeal ObamaCare and stop job-killing environmental regulations and provide an environment in which businesses, not government, create jobs. The new members -- and the people they represent -- deserve a seat at the table,"" Barton said.\If Harris isn't picked for Energy and Commerce, he said his Plan B is to seek seats on the Agriculture and Natural Resources committees. Outgoing representative Kratovil serves on those two committees and also the House Armed Services Committee.\Energy and Commerce is an ""A"" committee, which means that Harris could only serve on it and no other committees.\Already under the microscope\On most days, Harris plans to commute to Washington from his home in Cockeysville or his vacation home in Cambridge, he said. The Capital Beltway shouldn't be a problem for the early riser.\""I'm used to getting up at 5 in the morning to get to the hospital. At 5 a.m., there's not a lot of traffic out,"" Harris said.\The 53-year-old Harris and his wife, Sylvia ""Cookie"" Harris, have five children. Their children are ages 11, 15, 19, 23 and 26, which Harris jokes contributes to a ""crowded house"" during the holidays.\Harris isn't sworn in yet, but he's already got a bitter taste of Washington's press corps -- and a lesson that private meetings aren't always private.\This past week, at a closed-door benefits meeting for incoming freshmen, their families and staff, Harris asked why it would take 28 days after being sworn for his government health insurance to kick in. That coverage is offered to federal employees and all members of Congress.\Harris, who under COBRA law could pay to extend his private coverage, didn't like the fact that Congress will be his first employer not to offer him immediate coverage. Harris thought he was asking a typical human resources question, but his inquiry has since blown up into a national news story following a report in Politico, a publication with a focus on Capitol Hill.\A group of House Democrats have sent a letter to GOP leadership, which encourages them to reveal who among them is skipping their government coverage if they're planning a repeal of the health care overhaul.\Harris, who has denied many media requests on the subject, told The Daily Times earlier in the week that the controversy is ""blown completely out of proportion.""\""During a routine human resources question-and-answer session for new employees, like any caring husband and father, I asked a simple question about how health care coverage for my family could continue during my transition to the new job,"" Harris said.\Staying true to the Shore\Harris said he plans on opening up two district offices on the Eastern Shore and one across the Bay Bridge. The locations will be finalized within the next month, he said.\He's named Kevin Reigrut, his chief of staff in Annapolis, as his congressional chief of staff.\Harris said protecting the Chesapeake Bay and Delmarva's poultry industry are issues transcending party affiliation. This week, he met Delaware's Democratic Congressman-elect John Carney for the first time and described the meeting as ""very cordial.""\""Even though he sits on the other side of the aisle, he sits on the same side of the bay as much of the district,"" Harris said.\Harris said he hasn't been enamored by the glitz in Washington so far. Nor is he overwhelmed with the realization that, after four years of fighting for the congressional seat, he'll finally walk the hallowed halls of the Capitol as member.\Harris said any excitement he's feeling is in the form of being part of the new Republican majority in the House.\As Harris begins his congressional journey, he said one thing won't change: He'll still practice medicine. To keep his medical license active, he plans on working a few days a year. He expects to work out of Memorial Hospital at Easton.\""I would like to continue practicing, even if it's just a few days a year,"" Harris said.\glatshaw@dmg.gannett.com\410-845-4643"
47," President Bush's sudden conversion last week from skeptic to global warming warrior was probably best summed up by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who observed: ""Nobody can ignore the question of climate change.""\ Mr. Bush should be welcomed to the party, however late his arrival. But his proposal to convene global talks aimed at setting long-term targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions can't be allowed to slow the momentum for swifter, more tangible efforts in the meantime.\ In fact, the president should demonstrate his new concern for the environment by backing legislation to impose a mandatory emission cap and trade program for the United States - thus leading by example.\ As host of this week's Group of Eight summit of industrialized nations, Ms. Merkel has proposed a 50 percent cut below 1990 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and a mandatory increase in energy efficiency. But the White House balks at binding targets and dismisses energy efficiency as a cheap and easy tactic that will yield only limited returns.\ Environmental advocates understandably suspect that Mr. Bush's proposal to write a new international accord on greenhouse emission targets by the end of next year is intended as a distraction and a stall.\ But it doesn't have to be. As Ms. Merkel and California Sen. Barbara Boxer, another advocate for swift, binding action, both noted, Mr. Bush's new position can provide the impetus to finally make progress.\ Throughout his presidency, Mr. Bush has refused to participate in the Kyoto treaty to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, contending it would hurt the U.S. economy - especially because the developing nations of China and India were not included. His new proposal would require participation by both of those countries.\ China can be expected to resist, contending that its industrial economy should be allowed to develop unfettered as those of Western nations did. It's a self-destructive argument, to be sure, but all the more reason that the United States - still the world's major source of greenhouse gases - should take the lead and impose domestic curbs.\ ""We're the world's leader when it comes to figuring out new ways to power our economy and be good stewards of the environment,"" Mr. Bush proclaimed. If so, it's time to show the rest of the world the way."
48,"Electricity prices were going up, environmentalism was in, and solar power companies were proliferating. But last year Maryland residents still didn't take the state up on all the financial incentives it offered for installing ""green"" power systems in their homes.\This year, however, Maryland residents flooded the state program with applications for grants to build solar and geothermal systems to help defray utility costs. Within a few weeks, more than $590,000 - all of the money available for the fiscal year that began this month - had been doled out.\State officials say the turnaround in demand was prompted by an increase in the grant amounts approved by the General Assembly during the winter session. Lawmakers raised grant amounts for systems that convert sunlight into electricity to as much as $10,000, up from $3,000, and tripled the amount residents could get for geothermal systems, which rely on the Earth's temperature to provide heating and cooling. Those grants are now as much as $3,000.\""In prior years, there wasn't enough of an incentive to enable people to justify the investment,"" said Malcolm Woolf, director of the Maryland Energy Administration. ""When the new grant window opened, we got flooded with applicants in a way that's never happened before.""\For the first time in the program's five-year history, there is a waiting list of dozens of residents seeking grants. While new funding will not be appropriated by state lawmakers until the next fiscal year, which begins in July 2009, state officials hope to be able to direct money to the program from the recently enacted Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\Cap and trade\The program establishes a cap-and-trade system in which industrial businesses would buy pollution credits through auctions. State officials estimate that it could generate $140 million a year. About 10 percent of those proceeds could be used to supplement the program, Woolf said. The first auction is scheduled for September.\With federal tax credits and state grants, homeowners could nearly halve the price of the typical solar-panel system, which costs less than $30,000. Such a system could reduce a homeowner's electricity bill by up to a third.\Madeleine Arnheim of Easton said that with the state incentives, it made financial sense for her and her husband to install a solar panel system while renovating their home. The fact that they could reduce their electric bill, which totaled $500 this month, made the idea all the more attractive.\And, Arnheim said, they try to be environmentally friendly by recycling and using energy-efficient lightbulbs because they want to leave a better world to their seven grandchildren.\""We thought, 'Why not go one step further?'"" she said. ""It's going to be very exciting to see what it does - I plan on standing out there watching the electric meter go backward. But it's also something that's good for the future and the environment.""\More needed\Environmentalists have applauded the state and federal help for homeowners, but they say more money needs to be allocated.\Not only has Maryland's program exhausted its funding, but some federal incentives are also scheduled to expire at the end of this year.\Gov. Martin O'Malley and the other governors signed a letter this week to congressional leaders asking them to extend for at least five years tax provisions that encourage the development of renewable energy and promote energy efficiency.\'Limited' program\Brad Heavner, director of Environment Maryland, said that while the higher grants are making it feasible for homeowners to install the solar and geothermal systems, the lack of funding has diminished the progress. ""Now the program is effective but limited,"" he said.\State officials note that funding is still available for the so-called Windswept program, which provides grants of up to $10,000 to offset the cost of small wind turbines for residents in certain locations.\laura.smitherman@baltsun.com\Credit: Sun reporter"
49,"Maryland and five other states launched a pioneering effort to combat climate change yesterday by auctioning off rights for power plants to release Earth-warming carbon dioxide into the air.\How much Maryland and the other states got for their pollution credits won't be announced until Monday, but the proceeds will be used for energy efficiency programs and other efforts designed to offset any resulting increase in rates - and, proponents argue, eventually reduce consumer bills.\The three-hour auction, kicked off by bell-ringing at the New York Mercantile Exchange, was the first of six rounds of bidding planned through next year.\It is part of a process in which Maryland and other states in the Northeast and MidAtlantic regions move to cap and ultimately reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas that scientists say is largely responsible for warming the planet.\Maryland Environment Secretary Shari T. Wilson, on hand for the opening bell, called it ""a landmark day"" because the states are the first in the country to begin regulating so-called greenhouse gases.\""It's really an extraordinary effort when you think about states collaborating on something like this,"" Wilson said. She said that because the federal government to date has not regulated greenhouse gases, states are moving to take action on their own.\A report by the world's top climate scientists concluded last year that global warming is already happening and human activity ""very likely"" contributes to it.\If warming continues unabated, it would bring higher average temperatures and a steady rise in sea levels in decades to come, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said.\The auction, in which 10 states ultimately will participate, is part of a pollution-control policy known as ""cap-and-trade."" The states have placed a ceiling, or cap, on how much pollution can be released and have begun selling off allowances or rights to emit that much.\Utilities are expected to seek ways to reduce their emissions, in order to hold down costs. Meanwhile, revenue from the auctions is to be invested in programs to help consumers use less electricity.\The states' moves could be a model for federal action to reduce the nation's climate-warming emissions. Both major presidential candidates have endorsed the cap-and-trade approach.\Legislative analysts projected this year that the state could earn $80 million or more through the six auctions if the allowances sold for $2 to $3 each. Each allowance permits the holder to release a ton of carbon dioxide.\Under legislation approved this year, 46 percent of the auction proceeds will be spent by the state to help consumers reduce their electricity bills through such steps as improving home insulation, upgrading to more efficient furnaces and installing compact fluorescent lightbulbs. Nearly a quarter, though, will go directly to ratepayers, at least partially offsetting expected rate increases resulting from utilities being charged to emit a gas they have been free to release until now.\Jonthan Schrag, executive director of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the multistate group running the auction, said analysts have predicted that electricity customers may have to pay $12 to $18 more per year because of the auctions.\But a study for the state Department of the Environment projects that Maryland customers might lower their bills by $22 per year as a result of the new energy-efficiency programs.\Critics still worry that the states' efforts to clamp down on carbon dioxide from power plants could drive up costs of electricity for Maryland consumers.\They also point out that neighboring states such as Pennsylvania and Virginia are not participating in the regulatory effort, and power plants could sell electricity to customers in Maryland without having to pay for their emissions.\Michael C. Powell, a lawyer for some of the state's large manufacturing firms, said his clients - large power users - are worried about even small rate increases.\Powell also said he was concerned that the cost of complying with Maryland's restrictions on carbon dioxide may discourage construction of new power plants in the state just when experts have warned there could be brownouts and energy shortages several years from now.\Matthias Ruth, who oversaw the study of the auction's effect on Maryland, acknowledged that it may cause a small increase in electric rates, at least at first.

50,"CHESTER - - Frank Kratovil Jr. made history as the first Democrat elected to Congress from Maryland's easternmost district since the 1980s. Now, he's struggling against a reverse tide, one that sweeps out congressmen from the president's party in the middle of a new administration.\The freshman lawmaker is probably best known for being hanged in effigy by a disgruntled Eastern Shore constituent. The incident underscored the tough challenge Kratovil faces every day.\He is caught between his conservative district and Democratic leaders who'd like to have his support for their ambitious national agenda. Heading into the final showdown over health care legislation, local voters say they'll be watching closely.\Mike O'Connor, a federal employee from Grasonville, wants Kratovil to go ""for the people, not for the Democratic Party"" on health care overhaul. ""If he were to vote against it, he would probably get my vote for re-election,"" says the 38-year-old Republican.\Dan Burnside, 35, also of Grasonville, crossed party lines to vote for Kratovil and hopes the congressman doesn't ""lose himself"" just because ""some lady,"" referring to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, ""tries to force your hand.""\Another Republican voter, John Maddy of Bay City in Queen Anne's County, observes that if Kratovil ""really wants a political career, he's going to have to ride the party line. But we're hoping that he'll hold true to what he says he'll do. So far, he's been pretty good.""\Despite that sort of praise, Kratovil is an underdog in his first re-election try. Independent analysts regard Republican challenger Andrew P. Harris of Baltimore County as the early favorite. So, too, do some of Harris' colleagues in the state Senate, who have half-jokingly taken to calling him ""Congressman.""\In 2008, Kratovil beat Harris by fewer than 3,000 votes in the 1st District, which takes in the entire Eastern Shore and largely Republican parts of suburban Baltimore, Anne Arundel and Harford counties. Presidential nominee Barack Obama's supporters may well have made the difference in the election.\This fall, Obama's name won't be on the ballot, and Kratovil, the most vulnerable congressional incumbent in the state, may find himself part of a negative national trend for Democrats. A prolonged economic downturn has created a brutal re-election environment for the party in power, with Democratic control of both the House and Senate at risk.\Typically, congressmen face the greatest chance of defeat after their initial terms, and 2010 appears to be no exception. Of the 15 most vulnerable House Democrats in the U.S., according to the latest nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report, all but one are first-termers like Kratovil.\Kratovil, in an interview, acknowledges there are ""some factors that are out of your control."" But, he insists, ""I have never been one to believe that you are not in control of your own destiny.""\He has been working several fronts in an effort to save his job. He joined the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and carved out the most independent voting record of any Maryland Democrat in Congress last year.\Kratovil helped deliver $70 million in earmarks to his district, more than triple what his Republican predecessor did the year before, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group. And he's raising a pile of cash to fight his Republican opponent.\""I said I was going to be independent, and I think that's what I've done,"" he says. A recent survey by National Journal, a respected Washington publication, gave him a score of 46 liberal and 54 conservative, putting him much closer than other members of Maryland's congressional delegation to the center.\Yes, he's heard the cynical joke on the House floor, that there's nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead skunks. And he agrees that politicians who fail to fully satisfy either end of the political equation can get hurt.\""But if you are going to change D.C.,"" he says, ""you need more people that are going to be moderate and reasonable and pragmatic and looking for solutions and not being totally ideologically driven.""\Trying to be reasonable, though, can cause problems in a hyperpartisan atmosphere. The 41-year-old congressman, who looks young enough to be a Boy Scout and sometimes sounds like one, got pounded after telling a reporter recently that he wanted to look at the latest version of health care legislation before making up his mind.\The national Republican Party, which has had Kratovil in its sights since before he took office, flooded both shores of the Chesapeake Bay with ominous, automated phone calls. They were designed to link him to a health care plan even less popular in his district than the country as a whole. They also reinforced another Republican attack theme: that he is a puppet of Obama and Speaker Pelosi.\""Nancy Pelosi let Frank Kratovil off the hook once, but now she's ready to cash in on the favor,"" Ken Spain, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a prepared statement. ""It's no secret that Kratovil is torn between falling in line with his party bosses and saving any chance he has for holding onto his seat in Congress. If Kratovil plans on walking the plank for the Obama-Pelosi health care agenda, he can start looking for a new job now - because voters will send him packing on Election Day.""\Kratovil was one of 39 House Democrats who voted against the health care overhaul last fall. He also says he'll oppose the Senate version when it comes up in the House vote this week.\His efforts to distance himself from the Democratic leadership can go only so far. His re-election is among the national party's top priorities, and he has the active support of Southern Maryland Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, the second-ranking House Democrat, who agreed to join Kratovil at a fundraising event in New York on Sunday.\Kratovil says he's proud of work he's done on behalf of his district, including a successful fight to preserve new-car dealerships that General Motors and Chrysler wanted to close. He also says he doesn't regret voting for Obama's economic stimulus package and a cap-and-trade energy measure, leaving him open to Republican attacks.\The former Queen Anne's County state's attorney, who knows what it's like to prosecute a bad case, hopes voters will see him as someone who is trying to fix a broken government. Already, he's rehearsing his closing argument for another national election about changing Washington.\""In terms of my race,"" he says, ""if you really want to make change, you have to have people who are reasonable, moderate, pragmatic. If we want to make sure the system doesn't change, keep sending the total extremists, the absolutists, the noncompromising, yes/no, black/white type of people. If we want to make sure it doesn't change, continue sending people like that.""\Credit: paul.west@baltsun.com"
51," Mayor Martin O'Malley announced yesterday that Baltimore will join a dozen states challenging the Bush administration's decision to exempt power plants from tough mercury pollution controls.\ ""Baltimore residents are spending a lot of money to fix their storm-water system to improve the quality of the Chesapeake Bay,"" O'Malley said. ""We couldn't stand by while President Bush gives coal- burning power plants a free pass.""\ The city decided to join Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and other states in the legal effort because Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. last week blocked efforts by Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. to force stronger air pollution regulations.\ Curran is O'Malley's father-in-law and both are Democrats; Ehrlich is a Republican.\ Environmental groups, including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, praised O'Malley for stepping up and showing environmental leadership while Ehrlich sided with industry.\ But Republicans and energy industry lobbyists called O'Malley's move political grandstanding, meant to burnish his image as he prepares to run for governor next year.\ ""I think the mayor should focus on the rising murder rate in Baltimore and leave statewide issues to the people elected to represent the state,"" said John Kane, chairman of the Maryland Republican Party.\ O'Malley replied that Kane doesn't have his facts right, saying the city's homicide totals are 20 percent lower than when he took office.\ In March, the Environmental Protection Agency exempted power plants from Clean Air Act requirements that all smokestacks be equipped with the best available technology to reduce mercury emissions.\ Instead, the EPA is instituting an industry-friendly ""cap and trade"" system for regulating power plant emissions. This free- market approach allows the plants to keep polluting if they pay fines when they exceed limits.\ The Bush administration argues that its system will achieve a 69 percent drop in mercury emissions by 2018. Environmental groups predict that this won't happen and say that EPA could achieve a 90 percent reduction by 2008 if it enforced existing law.\ Mercury is a pollutant that rises into the air when coal is burned, falling back down into waterways and causing brain damage in developing infants when their mothers eat too much contaminated fish.\ Baltimore would be the first city to join the states challenging the Bush mercury rules, although New York, San Francisco, Washington and other cities have challenged earlier Bush revisions of air regulations.\ Kim Coble, Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, praised the city for acting while the state is not.\ ""Mercury is one of the most toxic pollutants out there, and we have fish consumption advisories on every river in Maryland,"" Coble said.\ Ehrlich's office said the governor had no comment.\ Julie Oberg, spokeswoman for the Maryland Department of the Environment, said that state officials plan to meet with EPA administrators to urge them to strengthen mercury controls.\ ""Litigation takes a significant amount of time, and we think we can be more productive meeting and talking through these issues instead of going the litigation route,"" Oberg said.\ If that meeting doesn't persuade the EPA to be more aggressive about stopping pollution, Maryland still has the option of filing a legal challenge later, Oberg said.\ Credit: SUN STAFF"
52,"O'Malley administration officials said yesterday they don't yet know how they would achieve the governor's ambitious goal of cutting global-warming pollution by 90 percent by 2050.\But representatives of Maryland's only steel mill, the Domino Sugar factory in Baltimore and a paper mill in Western Maryland warned of closings or dire financial losses if the state passes a law with some of the nation's toughest limits on carbon dioxide.\""That plant is not going to survive,"" said Gene Burner, lobbyist for the ArcelorMittal steel plant at Sparrows Point, which employs 2,500 workers. ""In order to make steel, you have to produce carbon dioxide. ... The only way to limit carbon dioxide is not to make it.""\Gov. Martin O'Malley held a news conference to announce his support for legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions on all industries, following laws in California, New Jersey, Washington, Oregon, Minnesota and Hawaii.\The law would use financial rewards and punishments - as well as voluntary energy efficiency programs - to cut greenhouse gas pollution by 25 percent by 2020 and by 90 percent by 2050.\Environmentalists, scientists, public health experts and alternative energy companies also pledged their support for the Global Warming Solutions Act during a Senate hearing yesterday. The supporters argue that state limits are necessary to spur federal action and will help to prevent deadly floods and economic chaos brought by climate change.\O'Malley and other proponents of the bill, sponsored by Sen. Paul Pinsky and Del. Kumar P. Barve, argue that the bill could boost the state's economy by adding jobs in the solar, wind and alternative-energy fields.\""The era of fossil fuels and the damage that they have done to the planet and the air we breathe, that era has to become an era of the past,"" O'Malley said at the news conference, flanked by environmental advocates.\The bill sets aggressive targets but doesn't say which industries should cut pollution or by how much. The language doesn't specify what technologies businesses should use instead of burning coal and oil, or how homeowners and commuters might be affected.\Instead, the proposal gives broad authority to the Maryland Department of the Environment to impose a series of regulations that could affect all sectors of the economy - including transportation, housing and power.\State Secretary of the Environment Shari T. Wilson conceded during a hearing on the bill yesterday that that her agency doesn't know how the state would reach the goals or if the technology even exists yet.\""It is clear that a lot of innovation and new programs would be needed to meet that goal,"" Wilson said. ""But we are talking about 42 years in the future. And if you look over the last 42 years, at the kind of innovations that have taken place ... the goals are realistic.""\As early steps toward fighting global warming, the O'Malley administration is proposing to require power companies to buy more electricity from wind farms and other renewable energy sources. The administration also wants to encourage customers to use 15 percent less electricity by 2015.\The O'Malley administration offered amendments to Pinsky's bill yesterday that would give the state the option of using ""cap and trade"" systems to cut pollution from a variety of sectors.\""Cap and trade"" programs are systems that impose fees on businesses that pollute over a fixed limit and send cash to cleaner industries.\An analysis by the state Department of Legislative Services also says that the financial burden on businesses would be ""meaningful."" Costs ""could increase significantly"" for businesses because of new state fees on carbon dioxide emissions.\This uncertainty about the new regulations infuriated business representatives and some Republicans yesterday, who said state residents shouldn't be asked to take a leap of faith at a time of economic uncertainty.\John Holt, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Unions Local 1900 in Largo, which represents 1,700 power plant and electrical system workers in the state, predicted that the law could shut down power plants.\""They have basically said, `Trust us: We won't lose any revenues and we won't lose any jobs,'"" Holt said of the bill's sponsors.\State Sen. Andy Harris, a Republican, said the bill could impose fees up to $250 million a year on electric plants.\""That's a pretty high energy tax when our rate payers are already paying high taxes,"" Harris said.\Former California Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Terry Tamminen said costs for most customers and businesses would go down because regulations created by the state would encourage conservation. Tamminen said per capita energy consumption in California dropped 40 percent during the past decade because of its regulations.\tom.pelton@baltsun.com\Credit: Sun reporter"
53,"Staff Writer\POCOMOKE CITY -- Dan Holland is a dairy farmer tired of losing money on the milk his cows produce. He's contending with high fuel costs and competing in a global market.\The Pocomoke City farmer wants to do his part to help the environment. But he isn't sure if the 1,200-page climate bill the U.S. House approved last week is the answer.\""I'm all for a clean environment,"" said Holland, who also farms corn, soybeans and wheat on a 200-acre property. ""But the changes they're proposing are too rapid and it'll hammer us globally.""\In the grand scheme of the American Clean Energy and Security Act, known as the climate bill, Eastern Shore farmers represent a small stakeholder. But many fear it will potentially drive up their costs at a time when many operations are struggling to stay profitable.\The House bill would establish a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gases. It would set stricter emission limits on factories, and have those who go over their permits buy offset credits from businesses with excess space under the cap.\The goal is to reduce emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and more than 80 percent by 2050. The bill would also require states to increase renewable energy portfolios to 20 percent by 2020, although states could reach that benchmark by increasing energy efficiency.\Farmers would represent a natural seller in a newly created system for buying and selling emission permits. Yet at one point it appeared Maryland farmers might be excluded from selling off their unused greenhouse credits. That's because the original bill only included farmers who hadn't started using environmentally friendly practices, such as planting cover crops and not tilling the soil.\However, Rep. Frank M. Kratovil Jr., D-1st-Md., put in an amendment to restore the rights of local farmers. His spokesman, Kevin Lawlor, said Kratovil's amendment would make Maryland farmers eligible for as much as $1 billion in incentives for reducing emissions. The estimate, he said, is based on a Congressional Budget Office analysis.\""There are going to be people for (the bill) and those against it. But that fact is that he worked to help the bill help Maryland farmers rather than allow it to steamroll them,"" Lawlor said.\The climate legislation now heads to the Senate, where some senators have said a fall vote is likely. U.S. Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., told The Daily Times this week that the issue is a difficult one because it pits the interests of constituents against one another. For example, she wants to answer to the environmental community, but in western Maryland, she also represents coal producers.\Kent County farmer Pat Langenfelder grows corn, wheat, soybeans and barley on nearly 3,000 acres.\She believes many farmers aren't outspoken on the issue because they are busy in the fields during the summer and haven't yet had time to review the giant-sized climate bill.\Langenfelder contends that the cap-and-trade system will place costly limits on U.S. manufacturers, putting them at a disadvantage with overseas competitors.\Additionally, she isn't convinced farmers can earn enough selling carbon credits to cover losses from higher energy bills.\""How do we know? We don't even know what this bill will do,"" said Langenfelder, who is also the vice president of the Maryland Farm Bureau.\The state bureau will oppose the Senate version of the bill, barring any major amendments, said Val Connelly, director of government affairs. This is despite concessions made to the agricultural community before the House voted, such as giving U.S. Department of Agriculture, rather than the Environmental Protection Agency, oversight of agricultural offset provisions.\Estimates on how much the bill will drive up homeowner's energy costs vary wildly. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it will cost each household $175 a year in higher electric and heating bills.\However, the Washington-based Heritage Foundation forecasts $1,750 per household.\Brian Johnson, the federal affairs manager for Americans for Tax Reform in Washington, said the bill is ""job killing"" and suggestions otherwise are a ""criminally stupid idea.""\""The cap on emissions is really a cap on production,"" Johnson said.\Manufacturers will be forced to make less stuff, which means curtailing hiring or laying off employees, he said. Furthermore, the bill will drive up everybody's energy costs, Johnson said.\Holland said he expects more Worcester County farmers to get more outspoken on the bill as the summer goes on. In the meantime, he's got plenty else to worry about.\""The dairy farmers are getting wiped out. There's no export market. And there's powdered and whey coming in,"" he said.\glatshaw@dmg.gannett.com\410-845-4643\Kratovil fined\Rep. Frank M.

During that time frame, receipts must be recorded within 48 hours, Lawlor said.\""It was basically an administrative backlog. There was not enough manpower to process them,"" he said.\The FEC announced the fine in a recent weekly report. Kratovil paid the fine using campaign funds, Lawlor said.\In the 2008 campaign, Kratovil spent nearly $2 million to defeat state Sen. Andy Harris of Baltimore County, who spent $3 million. Harris has vowed to run against Kratovil in next year's election."
54,"Gov. Martin O'Malley will support a bill that would impose some of the nation's toughest limits on global warming pollution, according to administration and legislative sources.\The legislation, which is scheduled to be considered by a state Senate committee today, would impose a 25 percent cut in greenhouse gases from all industries in Maryland by 2020 and a 90 percent cut by 2050.\""He understands the problem, and he understands that science backs it up, so I appreciate his efforts to push it through to become law,"" said Sen. Paul G. Pinsky, a Prince George's County Democrat and sponsor of the Global Warming Solutions Act.\Under the proposal, the state would use a system of financial penalties and rewards to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists have concluded are warming the atmosphere and melting polar ice, causing rising sea levels.\Many environmental groups support the bill, saying that Maryland's low-lying Eastern Shore is especially vulnerable to flooding, with its hundreds of miles of coastline.\But business groups and many Republicans are fighting the proposal, saying that mandatory limits on carbon dioxide could drive businesses out of the state and derail the economy.\More regulations on pollution from power plants are likely to further drive up the cost of electricity and a wide variety of products and services that depend on electricity, critics say.\Republican Sen. David R. Brinkley, the Senate minority leader from Frederick County, said voters still smarting from O'Malley's recent tax increases will perceive this legislation as yet another tax.\""It's not going to be at all positive for the economy, but this legislature and this administration [don't] care,"" Brinkley said. ""They are more interested in making political statements about saving the Earth than saving Maryland jobs.""\Environment Maryland and other advocacy groups pushing the legislation counter that mandates for more alternative energy, such as wind and solar power, could create ""green-collar"" jobs.\It's not clear what the bill's chances of passage are. A similar bill failed last year, although the O'Malley administration helped win approval for a more limited ""clean cars"" bill that will cut emissions of global warming gases from vehicles by one-third.\Two years ago, the Maryland General Assembly passed a law that will cut carbon dioxide pollution from power plants by 10 percent. Together, the two laws would get the state to roughly a quarter of the 90 percent reduction goal laid out by this year's Global Warming Solutions Act, analysts estimate.\Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, who played a role in the defeat of last year's version of the ""Global Warming Solutions Act,"" said he thinks the bill will pass in some form this year.\""I have met with union representatives from Sparrows Point, and they're indicating the bill as presently drafted could shut down Sparrows Point and could cost the state 3,000 jobs, so I think some amendments are going to be needed,"" Miller said.\House Speaker Michael E. Busch wouldn't say yesterday whether he will support the bill or whether he thinks it will pass, saying he needs to see the specifics of the final legislation.\""I support the idea"" of fighting global warming, said Busch, a Democrat. ""But ... you have to ask whether that can realistically take place or not,"" he said of a mandatory cap.\An administration official familiar with O'Malley's plans said the governor intends to announce his support of Pinsky's bill, with amendments, today.\Pinsky said the administration might offer an amendment that would make ""cap and trade"" systems optional for industries beyond the electricity sector, with the decision on how to regulate greenhouse gases to be made by the Maryland Department of the Environment.\""Cap and trade"" systems impose financial penalties on businesses that exceed set limits on greenhouse gas emissions, with the money used to reward cleaner businesses.\Pinsky's bill follows the models of similar laws passed recently by California and New Jersey.\The proposal does not specify exactly how the state would cut greenhouse gases. But the bill lays out a timetable that the state's environmental agencies must follow to propose a series of regulations for each business and sector of the economy.\Supporters of Maryland's bill predict that early steps likely to be included would encourage the construction of energy-efficient buildings and the adoption of anti-sprawl measures to cut down on the miles that people commute.\During a meeting of activists in Annapolis yesterday, several environmental groups said they support Pinsky's bill as a way to force federal action against pollution.\""We are not seeing leadership at the federal level on this,"" said Kim Coble, Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\The Maryland Chamber of Commerce opposes the bill, arguing on its Web site that the limits would be impossible to achieve and would drive businesses out of the state.\Del. Warren Miller, a Howard County Republican, said electricity customers who were outraged by the 72 percent BGE rate increase will be even angrier at the rate increases that would follow a cap on carbon dioxide emissions.\""This is a federal issue, and I think it's a lot of hype,"" Miller said. ""It's going to bankrupt a lot of people and a lot of businesses.""\tom.pelton@baltsun.com\Sun reporter Gadi Dechter contributed to this article.\Credit: Sun reporter"
55,"Maryland regulators are considering exemptions for a proposed Calvert County power plant and other generators from a regional auction of carbon credits that is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\The idea of granting free carbon credits to potential polluters had rankled some environmentalists and state lawmakers, but Maryland's projected energy shortage is so acute that many now support the idea as a way to get new electricity online and to head off potential rolling blackouts.\Gov. Martin O'Malley's administration has been working to address the state's energy needs while revamping environmental laws, and the concession is the latest nod to a balancing act that officials say is required among economic, corporate and ecological concerns.\The Democratic governor signed several environmental and energy bills yesterday, including legislation that sets out how to spend the regional auction proceeds, limits development near the Chesapeake Bay and establishes ""green"" building standards for new schools. O'Malley also signed a bill ratifying an agreement with Constellation Energy Group that provides $170, one-time rebates to residential customers of Baltimore Gas & Electric Co.\""The imperative is to create a more sustainable future for our state in terms of the land, the air, the water that we use and also therefore the energy that we use,"" O'Malley said during the bill-signing ceremony in Annapolis.\The administration won approval during this year's General Assembly session of proposals intended to reduce the state's reliance on fossil fuels and costs for consumers.\Carbon credit auction proceeds, for example, will go to energy efficiency and conservation programs meant to lower electricity usage and bills. Another bill O'Malley signed yesterday will increase grants for solar energy and geothermal heat pump systems for homes.\The new laws also set out a number of long-range goals. They aim to reduce the state's energy consumption 15 percent by 2015 and to double the amount of renewable energy that power companies must provide for sale to customers to 20 percent by 2022.\The Constellation settlement is valued at $2 billion and ends a legal battle with the state. In addition to the credits, consumers would no longer be obligated to pay $1.5 billion in future costs for dismantling nuclear power plants in Southern Maryland, as had been stipulated as part of the state's 1999 deregulation plan.\The settlement also gives the state some assurance that the company will build a nuclear power plant here. In exchange, the company avoids regulatory inquiries into certain costs consumers paid as part of the state's move to a deregulated energy industry.\Some lawmakers said the changes in energy and environmental policy will add to consumer costs.\""This all happens at a time when people are paying more for gas and more for groceries, and the national economy is going down,"" said Sen. Allan H. Kittleman, a Republican representing Howard and Carroll counties.\Separately yesterday, regulators said that the Department of the Environment plans to promulgate rules by January to set aside up to 5 percent of carbon credits under the regional auction for cleaner energy generators that come online before the summer of 2012. That would potentially include the planned Southern Maryland plant. The agency set out the time frame in a letter to lawmakers this month, said Shari T. Wilson, the state secretary of the environment.\""Maryland has a reliability challenge,"" said Malcolm Woolf, director of the Maryland Energy Administration.\Competitive Power Ventures Inc., the Silver Spring-based company, plans to build a natural gas-fired power plant in Charles County. The 640-megawatt plant would provide electricity to about 600,000 homes in Washington and Central Maryland.\Under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - a cooperative effort of 10 northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states to fight global warming - carbon-dioxide emission ""allowances"" are to be auctioned this year. The cap-and-trade system in Maryland is expected to raise $80 million to $260 million a year.\Sharon Segner, a director at the company, said the set-asides would level the playing field for new power plants competing for energy contracts with generators in neighboring states such as Pennsylvania and Virginia, which are not part of the regional auction. She also said that the credits would have cost tens of millions of dollars and noted that the exemptions would be limited to the first six years of the system.\Sen. George W. Della, a Baltimore Democrat, said he had concerns about exemptions. ""If you're going to make a law,"" he said, ""you would assume that it would apply to everybody, good or bad, and there would be no exemptions.""\But Brad Heavner, director of Environment Maryland, said that other states have created similar set-asides, and that ""there has not been any big objection."" He added: ""As long as cleaner fossil-fuel plants are replacing dirty fossil fuel plants, it's a plus for the environment.""\Sen. Thomas ""Mac"" Middleton, Finance Committee chairman, said company officials knew the plant would be subject to the auction when they agreed to build the plant and that they also knew the state was ""in dire straits"" in terms of energy shortfalls.\""It's a tough balancing act,"" Middleton said. ""The only way I would support this is if it's tied to reliability.""\laura.smitherman@baltsun.com\Credit: sun reporter"
56," WASHINGTON - In a long-sought victory for the energy industry, the Bush administration announced yesterday sweeping changes to clean-air rules that it contends will help industrial plants make necessary renovations to reduce pollution.\ The decision, perhaps the most significant environmental action to date by the Bush administration, was criticized by environmentalists. They say the changes will actually make it easier for industrial plants to increase their dirty emissions.\ Administration officials strenuously disputed criticism that their decision would roll back the Clean Air Act rules that require industries to modernize their pollution controls when their plants undergo major expansions or upgrades.\ They also rejected the notion that their decision would lead to more pollution, especially in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.\ On the contrary, officials said, the changes are likely to aid the environment by correcting flaws in the 30-year-old Clean Air Act.\ Under the law, they argued, power plants, chemical plants and oil refineries are discouraged from making renovations that would reduce dirty emissions. Every time these industries try to renovate, officials say, they trigger costly and unwarranted legal scrutiny.\ ""These reforms are about making the Clean Air Act work effectively,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, administrator the Environmental Protection Agency.\ Specifically, Whitman announced changes in how a provision of the Clean Air Act called ""new-source review"" would be enforced.\ Some of the changes could take effect within weeks and require no congressional review or public comment, officials said. Others will require lengthy periods of public comment and might not take effect for a few years.\ In general, the changes would make it easier for industrial facilities to sidestep new-source review. That provision requires older facilities, such as coal-fired plants, to upgrade their pollution controls whenever they undergo significant renovations.\ Under the Clinton administration, the EPA brought dozens of lawsuits against aging coal plants, mostly in the Midwest, arguing that those plants had undergone renovations without modernizing pollution controls.\ Yesterday, President Bush's EPA proposed ways for facilities to avoid the requirements of new-source review, in some cases for up to 10 years.\ The announcement reflected Bush's broader thinking on the environment. He has often argued that once their legal burdens are eased, private companies could find on their own the cheapest and most efficient ways to cut pollution.\ He has long expressed concern that too much regulation in the energy industry discourages the investments in technology that would maximize production of electricity for Americans.\ Yesterday, he said his administration ""is committed to clean air, and we're going to work vigorously to achieve clean air.""\ But the reaction from some influential members of Congress, as well as environmental groups, was fierce.\ These critics said they were concerned that Bush's changes would allow power plants to pollute more. They also asserted that the EPA's action would make it harder for government regulators to do their jobs - specifically, forcing power plants to install modern anti-pollution technology through the threat of fines or lawsuits.\ Bush's critics have long accused the White House of carrying out an environmental policy that reflects the interests of its allies in the energy industry, which heavily supported Bush's campaign for president.\ Yesterday, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, said, ""Once again, clean air takes a back seat to the polluters and the special interests that seem to have such power in this administration.""\ Sen. James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called for a hearing to ""examine the administration's decision-making process"" that led to yesterday's announcement.\ ""This administration is intent on undoing more than 25 years of progress on clean air - the question is why?"" Jeffords said. ""This decision is a victory for outdated polluting power plants and a devastating defeat for public health and our environment. Why anyone would pick smog and soot over clean air is beyond comprehension.""\ Environmental groups said they would likely challenge the changes in court. In particular, they argued that the administration did not invite enough public comment before announcing the decision and that the action is inconsistent with how the Clean Air Act was written three decades ago.\ ""It is difficult to imagine a more aggressive assault on our clean air protections,"" said Rebecca Stanfield of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\ ""We hope and expect that many of these changes will be ruled illegal. But in the meantime, a lot of people will suffer unnecessarily from heart and lung disease, and a lot of environmental damage will be done.""\ Administration officials insisted that industrial pollution overall would decline under their plan. But they conceded that they lacked hard evidence.\ ""We don't have a specific analysis of that,"" said Jeffrey Holmstead, the assistant EPA administrator for air and radiation.\ But studies of individual plants and other facilities, Holmstead said, have shown ""significant reductions.""\ Administration officials praised a proposal made by Bush several months ago which, they said, could eventually replace new-source review and guarantee that pollution nationwide would decline in coming years. That proposal, which Congress would have to write into law, would set net nationwide limits on pollution by power plants over the next decade.\ Critics have noted that that plan relies on a ""cap and trade"" system that allows some facilities to pay for the right to pollute more, so long as overall pollution in the country drops. That would mean, opponents say, that individual communities could be devastated by higher pollution levels if they were near a particularly dirty plant.\ The administration did not go as far as it could have and therefore did not fully satisfy the utility industry. That industry has long contended that power plants were being unfairly sued by the EPA, which accused them of renovating without installing pollution controls.\ Often, industry representatives argued, they were only carrying out routine maintenance that should not have triggered the requirements of new-source review. The industry failed to secure a clear statement from the administration that routine maintenance is exempt from new-source review.\ Administration officials said they would spend several years hearing public comment before making such a determination.\ ""Resolving the routine maintenance issue is an issue long overdue,"" said Scott Segal, an attorney with the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, an advocacy group for several large utility companies.\ Segal said the administration ""could have been more specific about what they were going to propose. That would have given us some more clarity.""\ But he called the announcement yesterday ""a step in the right direction.""\ Merrylin Zaw-Mon, acting secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment, complained that the changes could let power plants in the state - and larger plants in the Midwest whose air pollution is carried to the East Coast - boost emissions with little oversight.\ ""We are very concerned,"" said Zaw-Mon, who served as a top administrator in the Clinton EPA. ""The foremost principle has to be that there are no emission increases.""\ Maryland, along with other Eastern states, joined in the lawsuits filed by the EPA under Clinton against Midwest power plants. After yesterday's announcement, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said he ""will pursue legal action in federal court to prevent the [Bush] Administration from gutting the Clean Air Act.""\ S. William Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators, said the changes would ""set the Clean Air program back a giant step.""\ Becker said his group, which represents regulators around the country, had no input into the administration's decision.\ ""We're the ones that have to implement these changes,"" he said, ""and they have not heeded our recommendations. They have ignored us.""\ Credit: SUN NATIONAL STAFF"
57," Clear Skies plan adds to progress cleaning the air\ The Sun's editorial ""Audit the messenger?"" (March 1) repeated the erroneous argument that doing nothing would be better than enacting President Bush's proposal to reduce pollution by unprecedented levels.\ However, if the Clear Skies Act proposed by the president is passed, it will drastically improve the nation's air quality by requiring U.S. power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury by an average of 70 percent.\ The Environmental Protection Agency predicts that, when fully implemented in 2020, these reductions would annually prevent more than 14,000 premature deaths, 30,000 hospital visits and 23,000 nonfatal heart attacks.\ The initiative would improve visibility in our national parks, help alleviate smog and particulate matter and protect the health of our ecosystem by reducing acid rain and mercury deposits.\ To achieve these extraordinary results, Clear Skies would require the energy industry to invest nearly $50 billion to install pollution-reduction technologies.\ Through a proven cap-and-trade system modeled on our successful acid rain program, the plan would encourage facilities to invest in better, more-cost-effective ways to reduce pollution.\ The editorial also suggests that the Clear Skies Act would do no more than the EPA's proposed Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) about sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.\ However, while CAIR would reduce power sector emissions in 28 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia, including Maryland, it would not apply to the rest of the nation.\ Clear Skies would create permanent, nationwide protection of our air, our environment and our health.\ The Sun should recognize that to continue our progress toward cleaner air, something needs to be done.\ Doing nothing does just what it says - nothing.\ Jeff Holmstead\ Washington\ The writer is an assistant administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\ Bush's budget cuts put security at risk\ The budget President Bush has proposed includes disastrous cuts for programs important to the people of Maryland (""Budget of shame,"" Opinion\ Commentary,"" March 8).\ These cuts are all the more troubling given the high costs of the war in Iraq - a war the administration lied about in trying to convince the American people to back it, and one the administration is finding increasingly hard to defend at home and abroad.\ The president said that one of the reasons we went to war in Iraq was to rid the world of a major terrorist threat. However, it is increasingly clear that there was no link between the events of Sept. 11, 2001, and the regime of Saddam Hussein.\ Strangely, the president's budget includes cuts for homeland security in Maryland totaling $19.9 million (and $420 million nationwide). In addition, Mr. Bush's budget cuts Community Oriented Policing Services by 96 percent, a program which has put officers on Maryland's streets.\ Are we really supposed to feel safer after these cuts?\ One of President Bush's first accomplishments was to pass a tax cut that favored people in higher income brackets. These tax cuts have forced cuts in major programs, and the administration's suspect war in Iraq depletes these important programs even more.\ President Bush says these budget cuts are necessary to reduce the deficit. But he is largely responsible for that deficit.\ To preserve programs important to the security of our state, I would rather see a rollback of the tax cuts and an end to a war that is killing and wounding thousands of young people.\ Robert M. Kublawi\ Belcamp\ Reform plan imperils financial futures\ Many future retirees will never become retirees. They won't be able to afford to stop working, especially if President Bush's Social Security ""reforms"" are put into place (""Pelosi warns students against Bush proposal,"" March 5).\ Already, a great many senior citizens scrape by financially, often having to choose between their prescription medicines and rent or food.\ In this very wealthy country, only a very few are wealthy. And this administration is apparently determined to keep it that way.\ One of the problems is a tremendous gap in financial literacy. Of course, there's no money to address this in our increasingly underfunded school system, but a course in personal finance should be mandatory to graduate even from middle school, so the lessons can be imparted before those who would consider dropping out of high school do so.\ Let's make sure college kids know that the pre-approved credit card applications with which they're inundated aren't free money. Let's make sure the college-bound student knows how to finance his or her education.\ And let's make sure people can pass a test proving they're qualified to choose an investment plan before they can ""opt"" to put a portion of their Social Security deduction into a private plan.\ Lynn Stonebraker\ Annapolis\ A horrible invasion of women's privacy\ In The Sun's editorial ""An intimate assault"" (March 3), I learned that Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline is seeking the names and medical information of women and girls who have received abortions in Kansas. As a female, and as a nursing student at the Johns Hopkins University, I am completely horrified.\ As part of the nursing school curriculum, we have been taught the sanctity of medical records over and over and over again. Every time I start a new clinical rotation, the privacy practices are stressed anew.\ At this point, I feel as though I could recite the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) myself.\ I thought it was overdone and a bit redundant to go through this issue every seven weeks or so. But now I see the wisdom in doing so.\ I view people's medical records as sacrosanct, and I would never, ever think to violate a person's privacy by disclosing very personal medical information.\ I can understand that Mr. Kline is against abortion. But to violate people's medical privacy to further one's political agenda is shameful.\ Laura Adler\ Hyattsville\ Victims of abuse deserve day in court\ Dan Rodricks column ""Delayed justice is not to be denied"" (March 3) was on the money.\ What Mr. Rodricks reveals has also happened to many other victims, many of whom could not deal with the consequences of molestation until many years after the crime because they had done all they could to black out such a horrible experience from their lives.\ I don't buy the Catholic Church's assertion that it has done all it can to help these victims of sexual abuse. And I don't buy the idea that compensating victims of sexual abuse by clergy would prevent the church from fulfilling its mission.\ The church failed miserably by failing to prevent the initial abuse of children in its care, and it continues the abuse by trying to shirk its responsibility to the victims.\ Children who were sexual abuse victims have had their childhood murdered. Murder has no statute of limitations.\ Now is the time for the laws to change so that the victims may have their day in court.\ Kevin Miskelly\ Baltimore\ Parents hold the key to children's success\ Bill Gates' column declaring high school ""obsolete"" is as interesting for what it doesn't say as for what it says (""High schools are designed to fail,"" March 6). Left out of his analysis is any mention of the central role parents play in shaping their kids' experience in school and their expectations for the future.\ While high school principals, teachers and guidance counselors have an influence on students' self-esteem and sense of direction, it's unfair to put the burden on them to make or break each child's future. They cannot reasonably be expected to undo in four years what parents have done - or not done - in the previous 14.\ Parents need to be held accountable for nurturing, educating and motivating their children from birth to independence.\ Studies show that what happens in early childhood is the largest single influence on success in grade school, high school and beyond.\ If we really want to prepare our kids to be all they can be, the education system is not the only institution that needs reform - so does the family.\ Robert J. Inlow\ Charlottesville, Va.\ Why allow insults to rural residents?\ So Kevin Cowherd doesn't like the Orioles' new hats. He's entitled to that opinion - even though most people I've asked think they're OK (""What is it about the O's and hats?"" March 7).\ But maybe I only asked ""hicks and plowboys."" Or perhaps it was because the ""pro-rube crowd"" he mentioned couldn't hear the question over the squishing of their ""manure-caked boots"" while they were hiking up their ""bib overalls"" and mumbling through the ""piece of straw dangling"" from their mouths.\ I find it disgusting that The Sun sees fit to allow Mr. Cowherd to use such terms.\ Were he to use such negative stereotypical terms to describe African-Americans, Jews, Hispanics, Muslims or homosexuals, the hue and cry would be deafening. But apparently The Sun and Mr. Cowherd feel that it is acceptable to use derogatory terms when writing about those less-urbane and supposedly less-cultured folks from outside the Beltway.\ So Mr. Cowherd doesn't like the hats. Big deal.\ Why does that mean he can denigrate people who moved here from the country or have roots there?\ Steven P. Strohmier\ Dundalk\ Coed dormitories aren't like brothels\ I was surprised and dismayed by Susan Reimer's column that quotes a Loyola College theology professor, Vigen Guroian, regarding coed dorms (""In essay, Loyola professor likens coed dorms to brothels,"" March 8). Mr. Guroian argues that cohabitation creates a brothel environment and peer pressure for women to engage in sexual activities. He cited female students who write in essays that they feel pressured into participating in casual sex and that coed dorms contribute to this. I think this is ludicrous.\ I am a junior at Loyola College and have lived in the dorms for the last three years. I never felt pressured to ""prove my sexual health.""\ I have numerous friends and acquaintances who do not feel the need to engage in sexual activities. Those who do feel pressure may be weak and easily persuaded into unhealthy activities.\ Having women and men living on the same floor does not create a sexual frenzy, as Mr. Guroian suggests.\ Yes, there are promiscuous students at college. There are also promiscuous students in high school. But there are also programs on Loyola's campus that encourage abstinence.\ This column implies that Loyola and other colleges with similar policies are immoral institutions without boundaries. This is the furthest thing from the truth.\ Loyola has been a wonderful experience for me. Loyola encourages students to be adults and treats students accordingly.\ If some students cannot conduct themselves in this manner, perhaps their families didn't give them experience with boundaries or instill in them proper internal control.\ For me, coed dorms have been a positive experience.\ They have given me equal exposure to both sexes, which prepares me for what I will experience in the real world.\ Laura Sabin\ Pasadena\ Gaps in knowledge no sign of the divine\ The writer of the letter ""Evidence isn't inconsistent with a creator of life"" (March 5) suggests that those who have defended evolution in The Sun ""fail to add that neither is there scientific evidence against an intelligent agency (or creator).""\ As a scientist, the writer should be very aware of the difficulty, even the near impossibility, of proving a negative.\ And the writer fails to add that neither is there scientific evidence against little green men from Alpha Centauri having deposited life on our planet. Nor is there scientific evidence against human life having been created by technologically advanced dinosaurs who later perished in a dangerous experiment gone horribly wrong.\ The possibilities (and improbabilities) are endless.\ Scientific knowledge and faith need not be diametrically opposed. But faith must not be so blind as to ignore evidence.\ The fact that we do not yet fully understand an extremely complex system doesn't mean it is the result of some magical, supernatural force. Let's not confuse a lack of knowledge with a supernatural force.\ Paul Matlin\ Baltimore\ Saving lives, or taking them?\ The current debate in the Maryland General Assembly concerning the funding of stem cell research pits two groups against one another, despite the fact that both value life (""Bill to fund stem cell studies debated,"" March 3).\ One group objects to such research because it means the destruction of a clump of cells with all the genetic information needed to develop into a viable human being.\ The other perceives that stem cell research will give them a new lease on life by providing therapies for disabling illnesses.\ Would we be compromising the sanctity of life if embryonic cells were rescued from an ignominious death down the drain and used instead to serve a meaningful purpose?\ I do not advocate the creation of human embryos to serve as laboratory tools.\ But I doubt God would have serious objection if the miracles contained in the many microscopic clumps of cells now sitting in freezers were released to ease the anguish of the seriously ill.\ I hope our legislators will fund the research that would finally dignify the creation of those abandoned embryos.\ Lorraine G. Fiset\ Timonium\ My family has felt firsthand the crippling and devastating effects of diseases such as Alzheimer's and cancer.\ It has been a foregone conclusion since my childhood that my parents will die from one of these diseases and that, ultimately, so will I.\ But it doesn't have to be that way. In the most technologically advanced society in the history of mankind, it is our responsibility to fight the devastation caused by these diseases.\ The moral and ethical concerns related to stem cell research must be weighed carefully.\ But in the end, it is our moral responsibility to fund research that could help so many people ease their suffering.\ The costs of treatment and lost productivity as a result of chronic, degenerative and acute diseases in the United States amount to hundreds of billions of dollars every year. And estimates of the economic costs of these diseases do not account for the human loss and suffering associated with these conditions.\ Stem cell research offers immense promise for developing new therapies and a better understanding of these debilitating diseases and could lead to unprecedented treatments and potential cures for Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, cancer and other diseases.\ Bills now before the legislature would appropriate $25 million for embryonic stem cell research.\ We can't afford to allow the ideological right to stand in the way of this legislation.\ Shaun E.

It never becomes anything but a human being, and birth is only one development event of many along that entire time period.\ A life created in a test tube or petri dish does exactly the same thing.

It is its potential that defines that life.\ If you kill a human who is 10 years old, you have cut short (aborted) a human life. If you kill a human one second after fertilization, you have cut short (aborted) a human life.\ It is understandable that those who see loved ones suffering from tragic diseases want every possibility of cure explored.\ But, please, let's not do it at the cost of denying reality itself and reducing all human life to a mere commodity to be toyed with and discarded at will.\ That would put us all at risk.\ David N.

58," The Ehrlich administration has blocked Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. from going to court to challenge new federal regulations that environmental groups say will hinder efforts to curb air pollution from power plants.\ Curran, a Democrat, had sought Republican Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.'s approval to join 12 other states in a legal effort to overturn rules announced by the Bush administration in March. The rules exempt coal-fired power plants from tough mercury pollution-control requirements, instituting an emissions trading program instead.\ Ehrlich said no to Curran's proposal, both offices said yesterday.\ Neither Curran, who has been attorney general for 18 years, nor Stephen H. Sachs, his predecessor for eight years, could recall a similar example of a governor denying such a request.\ But both said that the governor has the right to do so, because the attorney general -- although independently elected -- serves as legal adviser to the state administration, which as the client has final authority.\ ""I think the national law that would best protect the Chesapeake Bay and the people of Maryland is the law we have now, not de- listing power plants as a source of air pollution to be regulated,"" Curran said yesterday. ""I prefer the approach of our sister states.""\ Henry Fawell, a spokesman for Ehrlich, said the governor was following the ""recommendations of the scientists at the Maryland Department of the Environment"" and referred questions to that agency.\ Julie Oberg, an MDE spokeswoman, said the department is concerned that the Bush administration's approach to mercury is not strong enough. Instead of filing a lawsuit, the agency believed it would be more productive to ask for a meeting with new EPA administrator Stephen Johnson to request stronger national rules.\ ""We have requested a meeting in order to try to persuade the Environmental Protection Agency to have more reductions [of mercury] in a shorter time frame,"" Oberg said. ""If our meeting doesn't go as we'd like it, we can still join the lawsuit.""\ Environmental groups, including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Riverkeeper Alliance, criticized the Ehrlich administration's approach, saying the rules have been made final by the EPA and the deadline for comments and most legal challenges has passed.\ Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York, California and Massachusetts are among the states that have filed challenges to the Bush administration's mercury-control regulations, which were finalized in March after a lengthy public-comment session.\ Maryland joined many of these states recently when they sued power plants in Ohio and West Virginia for sending air pollution downwind toward the East and the Chesapeake region.\ The new mercury regulations exempt power plants from requirements in the Clean Air Act that all smokestacks must install filters or other pollution-control devices to achieve maximum possible emission reductions.\ Instead, Bush's EPA adopted a free-market approach favored by industry, setting mercury-emission limits for power plants, but allowing them to pay for the right to exceed those caps and swap pollution credits with cleaner plants.\ The EPA said it aims to reduce mercury air pollution by 69 percent by 2018 through this ""cap and trade"" program. But environmental groups said a more likely result is a 55 percent reduction by 2030, and complained that this is much slower than the 90 percent reduction by 2008 that could be achieved by enforcing requirements in the Clean Air Act.\ Mercury air pollution is released when coal and other substances are burned in power plants and incinerators. Rain washes the pollutant into the Chesapeake Bay and other waterways, where it accumulates in fish and can damage the brains of developing infants when it is eaten by pregnant women.\ The deadline for filing legal challenges to the first part of the Bush mercury rules expired at midnight last night. The Ehrlich administration has another 60 days to challenge a second part of the regulations, governing the mercury-emissions trading program.\ But this part of the program is dependent on the first section of the regulations, so it would make no sense to challenge the second part and not the first, said Scott Edwards, legal director of the Waterkeeper Alliance, an environmental advocacy organization. ""The time to comment is over, the time to act is now,"" he said.\ Eryn Witcher, spokeswoman for the EPA, said the agency plans to set up a meeting between Maryland Environment Secretary Kendl P. Philbrick and EPA officials. ""We look forward to meeting with the governor's office and look forward to discussing the merits of the mercury rule,"" Witcher said.\ Maryland Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller sharply questioned Ehrlich's moves, saying the governor was looking out for ""corporate interests"" and was ""trying to appeal to his donor base.""\ ""If there is a person in his administration who cares about the environment, that person is obviously getting hooted down,"" Miller said.\ Credit: SUN STAFF"
59,"
A committee appointed by the governor is recommending that Maryland take drastic steps to reduce emissions that cause global warming.
\
The Maryland Commission on Climate Change, established by Gov. Martin O'Malley earlier this year, released its draft recommendations yesterday. They include cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 50 percent of 2006 levels by 2020. Ultimately, the state should have no emissions by 2100, the report said.
\
""The commission report is really strong, very bold and is moving in the right direction,"" said state Sen. Paul G. Pinsky, D-Prince George's.
\
Mr. Pinsky was a member of the commission and has tried to pass global warming bills in the General Assembly.
\
Environmental and health advocates quickly praised the report.
\
""It's a fantastic step forward,"" said Brad Heavner, director of the advocacy group Environment Maryland and a member of one of the commission's working groups. ""We were unsure when this commission was created whether they would study the issue to death or really do something strong. The administration is clearly taking the science seriously and not thinking about how much we should do, but how we can do what we have to do.""
\
A coalition of advocacy groups called the Alliance for Global Warming Solutions issued a statement saying the targets for reductions are ""visionary.""
\
""This forward thinking report is a fantastic first step in confronting the issue of catastrophic climate change ... It is heartening to see our state taking its future into its own hands, assuming a leading role on this global issue,"" said Claire Douglass, Maryland Campaign Coordinator for the Chesapeake
\
Climate Action Network and a leader of the coalition.
\
It's not clear yet whether Mr. O'Malley will embrace the report's recommendations - although he did appoint commission members and the effort was led by his environment secretary.
\
The state government's top air quality official, Tad Aburn, said the report ""sends a very significant message of how Maryland feels about climate change. We really need to push hard and be aggressive to reduce carbon production within our borders.""
\
Mr. O'Malley's spokesman, Christine Hanson, said this morning that the governor hadn't yet had a chance to review the report.
\
Lawmakers, too, have expressed reservations about a small state like Maryland trying to make a dent it a worldwide problem. A bill that would have set similar emission reduction targets tanked during the General Assembly's regular session in 2007.
\
But advocates argue that in the absence of national leadership on combating climate change, it's up to states to take action. Many say that if enough states commit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, then the federal government will follow suit.
\
Several states have passed similar programs, including most notably California. Others, like Maryland, are studying the idea.
\
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, climate change occurs when higher levels of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are released into Earth's atmosphere. Those gases trap heat, instead of allowing it to dissipate into space - thus the nickname, ""greenhouse effect.""
\
In Maryland, greenhouse gases come from a variety of sources, but mostly from producing electricity and driving vehicles.
\
The result is increased air temperatures that can lead to rising sea levels and changes in the climate patterns around the globe - including the possibility of more frequent or more severe storms.
\
To counteract those problems, the report says the state should set ""early, aggressive"" goals for reducing greenhouse gases.
\
State lawmakers should put those targets into law, the report said. To achieve the reductions, the state should set up a cap-and- trade program for major emitters.
\
The report also recommends public education, promoting alternative sources of energy, making building codes require energy efficient construction, improving wetlands and forests that suck up extra carbon dioxide and encouraging local governments to set up energy-saving programs.
\
Mr. Heavner said the only thing lacking in the report was how to deal with greenhouse gases that come from cars and trucks.
\
""We spend so much time talking about electricity, but we're not going to meet these goals unless we have programs to reduce driving,"" he said.
\
The draft report was supposed to be released in November, but it was pushed back due to the special session of the General Assembly last month. The final report is due in April.

As state lawmakers start slicing and dicing the governor's budget, environmentalists are marshalling their forces to protect their favorite programs.
\
To make their case, environmental groups are putting an economy and jobs spin on their requests to keep funding intact for environmental programs.
\
At a Senate budget hearing Wednesday, activists brought with them septic system installers, home-weatherization contractors and other business owners who directly benefit from government-funded environmental programs.
\
Dwayne Jones of Harford County, for example, said his contracting business received a boost from homeowners who secured ""flush fee"" grants to upgrade their septic systems to reduce nitrogen pollution.
\
""If it wasn't for this, we would have been out of business,"" Jones said as he waited his turn to testify in the hallway outside a packed hearing room.
\
Also out in the hallway, Matt Hargrove touted the benefits of a government program that helps residents pay for energy audits and weatherization repairs to their homes.
\
Hargrove's Eastern Shore company, Total Home Performance, has grown from two employees to 11. But he's hesitant to ""pull the trigger"" on hiring more employees as long as government funding is in limbo.
\
The leaders of environmental groups have carefully planned their budget tactics, which also include a jobs-focused Web site, www.supportgoodmdjobs.com.
\
As important as the environment and the Chesapeake Bay are to Marylanders and to politicians running for re-election, activists know they are fighting for a limited pool of money alongside other key causes, such as education, public safety and health care.
\
Kim Coble, Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said she hopes lawmakers understand that money spent on the environment generates jobs and improves the quality of life.
\
""The return for investment is really high,"" she said.
\
She said the environment should be both a short-term and a long-term investment for the state, and that environmental cleanup can't be pushed back time and again.
\
Coble said that this year's lobbying effort by environmentalists is unprecedented.
\
""It's something we haven't done before,"" she said.
\
Tommy Landers, from the advocacy group Environment Maryland, said he wants to make sure money isn't diverted from an energy-efficiency program into an energy-assistance program.
\
The money comes from when carbon credits are auctioned off to power plants through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a northeast carbon cap-and-trade program that Maryland participates in.
\
The carbon auction money was moved from energy efficiency to energy assistance last year, but the gap was filled with federal stimulus money. That stimulus money will eventually run out, leaving a big hole for helping Marylanders make their homes more efficient, Landers said.
\
Some other potential budget cuts environmentalists are fighting include:
\
The Chesapeake Bay 2010 Trust Fund: Envisioned as a $50 million fund, the governor proposed it to be $20 million this year, and budget analysts are recommending bringing it down to $10 million.
\
Maryland Environmental Trust: This agency, which works on land conservation, could be dissolved and incorporated into the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.
\
Fisheries Service: This section of DNR, which oversees oysters, crabs, rockfish and other fisheries, is facing a $1 million cut.
\
Maryland Department of Planning: This agency could lose seven or eight employees.

61,"SALISBURY -- Students under a deadline sometimes pull a fast one on their professor, passing off theory as fact in their midterm papers.\Just don't try it on ""professor"" Gilchrest.\Wayne T. Gilchrest, the former Maryland Congressman of 18 years, is an adjunct professor, teaching an upper level course at Salisbury University called ""The Environment and the Political Process."" An ardent proponent of safeguarding the Chesapeake Bay, Gilchrest had a hand in developing policies aimed at reducing pollution in the bay watershed. Nine terms in the Capitol have also taught him a thing or two about hyperbole -- which is why students are wise to get their facts straight in his course.\But Gilchrest is happy to report that his 33 students --a mix of environmental studies and political science majors --have been a great class this semester.\""The students have renewed my hope in the future of America,"" Gilchrest said following a class last week.\His course maps out places where the environment and politics intersect. He reads students their homework questions, avoiding handouts so he can save trees. His instructional style is old-school: no PowerPoint lectures, just him talking to the class. The approach works. It's led to lively debates about climate change, offshore drilling, energy policy in the Middle East and policy decisions, such as the Clean Water Act, and Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.\""He's got hands-on experience you can't get anywhere else,"" said Matthew Teffeau, 22, a political science major from Preston.\Frank in the hot seat\This past week, Rep. Frank Kratovil, the successor to Gilchrest's 1st District congressional seat, came into the class as a guest speaker.\Congress, he told them, rarely considers clear-cut issues. When Kratovil voted for the House climate change bill, which would establish a nationwide cap-and-trade market, he had to consider agricultural interests on the Eastern Shore, the environment and geo-political ramifications.\""It's not all good, not all bad. You find that the truth is somewhere in the middle,"" Kratovil said.\The class had plenty of questions for Kratovil. What impact will the Offshore Aquaculture Act have on native fish species? (He didn't know.) Would Kratovil vote to re-appoint Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House? (Yes.) Is enough being done to protect the Chesapeake Bay? (There is room for improvement.) How would Kratovil have voted on health care reform if it all came down to his vote? (He said he would have used that as leverage to improve the bill.)\A student asked Kratovil's reaction to President Barack Obama's decision to lift the drilling ban off the Atlantic Coast.\He replied: ""The first question I have is, 'Why aren't we drilling in areas we already do have leased?' No one has yet to explain that to me,"" Kratovil said.\Gilchrest said Kratovil has faced a harrowing first term. In addition to environmental issues, Kratovil has also had to consider the war in Afghanistan.\""If Frank was at SU, taking courses on all that, he'd be reading about 48 hours a day,"" Gilchrest said.\Following Kratovil's presentation, Gilchrest encouraged his students to discuss the answers the congressman gave.\'Be independent thinkers'\While Gilchrest said he feels a bit rusty in the classroom, his students say they haven't noticed.\""He's a great orator, just a wealth of knowledge,"" said Elizabeth Wright, 22, a senior majoring in environmental issues.\Wright said she enjoys hearing stories of Gilchrest's time in Congress. For example, he's told the class stories about being in his party whip's office and about other congressional meetings.\""It's refreshing, especially with partisan politics and everybody at each other's throats,"" said Adrianne Witkowski, 21, of Ellicott City, Md., a senior studying environmental issues.\Years ago, Gilchrest taught high school civics, history and contemporary issues in Kent County. That ended when he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1990. What followed were years in Washington in which the Republican made a name for himself by bucking his party on key votes. In 2007, Gilchrest was one of two Republicans to vote for establishing a timetable to withdraw from Iraq. Then Gilchrest went on to endorse Obama over Arizona Sen. John McCain, and endorsed Kratovil over his Republican challenger, Maryland Sen. Andy Harris.\Michael Lewis, director of the Environmental Issues program at SU, approached Gilchrest about the course after another teacher went on a sabbatical. He said Gilchrest is welcome to come back and teach next semester, too.\""Who better to teach a course on environmental policy than somebody who had done it for 18 years?""

63,"Capital News Service\WASHINGTON -- Maryland and Virginia's initiatives to save the Chesapeake Bay should serve as models for federal policy on global warming, Senate environment committee members said Wednesday.\The strategies include stricter clean car standards, a commission to set greenhouse gas reduction goals, electricity use reduction goals and developing new renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.\""I think we can learn from the states,"" said Sen. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. ""That's what federalism is about. You're giving us workable models that we can now use to develop policy.""\The discussion came during a three-hour committee hearing called by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to address the impact of global warming on the Chesapeake Bay. It included participation from top officials in both states, including all four senators, governors Martin O'Malley of Maryland and Tim Kaine of Virginia and U.S. Rep Wayne Gilchrest, R-Kennedyville.\Maryland environmentalists testified to a grim scenario for the bay, saying temperature increases could kill off species of fish, crabs and oysters, hurting the state's environment and economy.\Globally, rising temperatures could increase water levels in the bay between two and four feet by the end of the century, flooding every island as well as low-lying urban areas like Main Street in Annapolis, they said.\""It's not the dramatic 20-foot increases you see in some simulations, but think about the dramatic impact it (a two-foot increase) could have,"" said William Baker, president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a 194,000-member watchdog group.\A variety of suggestions were made to curb the problems, including implementing a cap-and-trade provision in a pending Senate bill to encourage farmers to use friendlier practices for the environment. If nutrients -- particularly nitrogen -- don't run into the water as frequently, it will result in fewer oxygen-free ""dead spots,"" they said.\The gloomy predictions helped clarify that global warming has an impact on the local level, senators said.\""Too often, the focus on global warming is simply on polar bears and Antarctica,"" said Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, D-Md.\O'Malley urged the Senate to develop national policy on global warming, eliminating the ""patchwork"" approach he said is now in place.\""Currently, 26 states have initiated actions related to climate change. Over 20 states have set substantial greenhouse gas reduction targets,"" O'Malley said. ""The time has come to develop national programs that effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning power plants, from our automobiles and a multitude of other sources.""\O'Malley said he suspects that once private industries see that green technology is affordable and desirable in the marketplace, they are more likely to pursue it. To this end, the state is researching how so-called ""green collar"" jobs, such as building wind farms, can be encouraged, he said.\Global warming has national security implications as well, Kaine told the senators. Rising water levels would have a direct impact on Hampton Roads, Va., home to numerous military installations, he said.\The hearing came the same day as the release of the National Wildlife Federation's new report, ""The Chesapeake Bay and Global Warming: A Paradise Lost for Hunters, Anglers and Outdoor Enthusiasts?""\Among the report's findings:\*Rapidly rising sea levels will flood coastal marshes on the bay, making coastal habitats and property vulnerable;\*Warmer air and water in the region will change the composition of the bay ecosystem, contributing to worsening oxygen-free dead spots and harmful algae blooms, which encourage the spread of diseases;\*More extreme weather, including floods, droughts and heat waves, will increase polluted runoff into the bay, worsening water quality;\*Changing climate patterns will make the Chesapeake less desirable to waterfowl for breeding, changing its ecosystem.\The report, which calls for updating land management practices, reducing greenhouse gases and increased funding for conservation, was cited by several senators during the hearing."

Cell tower farms
\
Regarding the article, 'Councilman aims to stop 'tower farms' ' (The Capital, Feb. 17).
\
The neighbors of the Preserve at Broad Creek community watch and wait as a cell phone tower farm blooms at Camp Woodlands, a Girl Scout Camp on Riva Road owned by the Girl Scouts of Central Maryland.
\
As stated in the article, six years ago ATT built the first 100-foot tall cell phone tower and now T Mobile will build a second phone tower within 200 feet of the already existing ATT cell phone tower.
\
If there are two cell phone towers on the Girl Scout property in 2011, how many cell phone towers will there be in the year 2017? Has anyone considered the degree of electromagnetic radiation that our young girls will be exposed to? What of the long-term health risks associated with electromagnetic radiation?
\
When parents send their little girls to summer camp at Camp Woodlands will they be informed of this risk and will they know that not one but now two cell phones towers are located on the property?
\
The decisions made today will affect our youth tomorrow. Is it in the best interest of the Girl Scouts to build a cell phone tower park? Are we teaching are youth about the importance of preserving the environment and maintaining open space or are we focusing on the immediate gratification of the revenue?
\
We need to protect our children. We need leadership that will protect our environment and regulate cell phone tower locations. As a concerned parent and resident of Annapolis, I am in full support of councilman Trumbauer's bill to limit the number of towers allowed on open-space parcels.

Government workers
\
A public discussion about the role of unions for government employees is sweeping the nation.
\
In Anne Arundel County, we have our own part in this dialog. County Executive John Leopold has taken a position that county officials should have direct control over wages and benefits of county employees. As a citizen and taxpayer of the county, I think that is just common sense.
\
I'm baffled by advertisements in local newspapers exhorting we the citizens of the county to stand up against the arrogance of the county executive. I see no way in which county citizens should be more aligned with government employees than with our elected county leaders when it comes to spending our money.
\
In fact, I'm puzzled at the widespread existence of government employee unions. In private industries, especially those with dangerous working conditions and low-paid workers, unions played a vital role in safeguarding worker health and safety.
\
I'm hard-pressed to identify the health and safety threats to government workers that require unions to safeguard them. There are constitutional protections that guarantee freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, so unions of government employees are legal.
\
However, I am incredulous that we have laws forcing government workers to pay money to support the operation of these unions. Such organizations should be allowed to succeed or fail on their own merit, not through forced funding.
\
Finally, the polemic created by the unions implying that the unions are the guardians of public safety and education should be challenged directly by all citizens. If our elected officials aren't taking care of public safety and education, we need new elected officials - not unelected, biased union officials representative of no one but government employees with a significant conflict of interest when it comes to spending public money.

Slots
\
The proposal to prohibit one slots licensee from trying to delay the creation of a casino by another slots licensee highlights something made obvious during the slots referendum last year: The state left taxpayers' money on the table when it bid out the slots licenses.
\
Profit made by the gaming industry above and beyond the normal profit that any business might expect is essentially tax money the state has given away. This is because the excess profits of casinos / slots are the direct result of the government exercising its sovereign power to limit the opportunities for legal gambling. These limits on the number of gambling venues create monopoly or cartel profits - to which the government is entitled since it created the income through its actions.
\
The same fiscal effect can be achieved by legalizing gambling and taxing it. But most governments prefer to limit entrants instead, partly because the revenue looks less like a tax. Yet doing it in this way requires skill to ensure the government receives the full franchise value of the activity, and the operators receive only the profit a normal business does.
\
Massive spending on the referendum showed that such skill was not exercised. If the issue had been zoning for any other business, it is inconceivable these sums would have been placed into play to influence the result. The spending is prima facie evidence of the excess profits the industry expects to collect.
\
No matter what we feel about taxes or legalized gambling, we should all agree that a tax should not be imposed so that revenue is given away. But that is what happened. Either in the initial conception of the slots process, or in the execution of the bidding, the state clearly failed to do its job.

No new alcohol tax
\
During the heat of the campaign, Gov. O'Malley said he would not support an alcohol tax and, as promised, he did not include one in his budget.
\
As a representative of the hospitality industry, I hope the governor continues to keep his word. Over the course of the recession, Maryland lost 3,600 hospitality jobs. The state's restaurants, bars and hotels are beginning to rebound, but recovery remains fragile.
\
The reality is this so-called ""dime-a-drink"" tax being considered by the General Assembly will cost consumers $2.65 more for an average bottle of spirits. The excise tax on spirits would jump to $10.03 per gallon; more than double the national average. This is the worst time to hit these businesses with a 570 percent tax hike.
\
The notion that taxes on alcohol in Maryland have not increased in decades is just plain wrong. The state excise tax is merely one of multiple taxes and fees Maryland consumers and small businesses are faced with when buying a bottle of spirits.
\
Since the last state excise tax increase, the federal excise tax on spirits has increased three times; the state sales tax has increased three times; and local liquor taxes and fees have increased. In Annapolis alone, officials raised the liquor license fee on restaurants, bars, liquor stores and hotels 54 percent in 2009 following a 30 percent license fee increase in 2008.
\
Tax restraint by our state leaders, as well as keeping an election campaign commitment, are the keys to sustaining a stronger revival of Maryland's hospitality industry and the accompanying job growth.

It doesn't exist. Let's discuss constraints the Constitution puts on government. I guess that's an obsolete notion too above the fray, high-minded individuals.
\
You say you're willing to discuss, and I suppose accept, government behavioral constraints to solve a problem you aren't convinced exists. Kind of dangerous don't you think?
\
Anyway, haven't you heard the discussion has ended? Climate change is real and Cap and Trade is the solution. Continue your open discussion and ongoing dialog if you need to pass the time.

History is rife with man wielding power over man. We're not immune.

Show me a politician who proposes Cap and Trade. I see a tyrant (that's right, I said it) who wants to control your access to energy.
\
Show me a politician who proposes single-payer health care. I see a tyrant who wants to control your access to medical care.
\
Show me a politician who proposes social and economic justice. I see a tyrant who believes you work at his pleasure.
\
Are we under tyranny? Are we on our way to tyranny? Will Dimiceli let us know when we get there?

One definition of tyranny is ""Arbitrary or unrestrained exercise of power.""

Take your Fourth Amendment to the airport next time you go. See how that's serving you. If the government is not constrained by one amendment then government is constrained by nothing.

Green lawns
\
In response to ''Farmers, environmentalists battle over bay'' (The Capital, Feb. 25). We need to give farmers a right to pursue their livelihoods, to grow crops or raise animals for our survival. It is a necessary business that benefits everyone. Farming requires the use of fertilizers organic or otherwise, to help yield a profit. Regulations are required for proper care and land management, and they will change as we study their effects on the bay.
\
Something we don't need is the abundance of chemicals that show up this time of year at every home store by the pallet-load - concoctions with an array of spreaders and sprayers to apply these unnecessary fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. You can smell them when you walk into any home or garden store. How much ends up in the bay?
\
I have friends who are members of environmental organizations that aim to save the bay, but have lawn services come each month to apply something that makes the lawn brilliant green almost year round. Is that OK for the bay? I don't think it can be.
\
I see homeowners applying turf builder right to the water's edge, or spraying madly at little weeds between the cracks in their pavement. The tragedy is that a green lawn is absolutely not necessary. It's just pretty. Meanwhile a healthy bay is not just pretty, it is absolutely necessary.
\
How many tons of chemicals are sold to the public within the bay's watershed? How many tons of chemicals are applied by lawn service companies each year? This is where a big change for the bay needs to happen, right away.
\
Those who make and sell all this stuff would disagree with me. But if you had to make a choice, would you rather buy food or gaze on your green lawn?

Theresa Winslow gives too much credit to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in her feature on the activities of the Annapolis Opera's maestro, Ron Gretz (The Sunday Capital, Feb. 27).

In writing of Gretz's musical career, she notes the first opera he directed in Annapolis was Mozart's ""Die Fliedermaus"" and that this season he is presenting another of Mozart's masterpieces, ""The Marriage of Figaro.""
\
Granted, Mozart was one of the most prolific of composers during his short life; however, he left ""Die Fliedermaus"" to Johann Strauss, who composed the opera a century after Mozart's death. So much for history.

How dare the union members and liberal left decry about corrupt presidents, leaders in industry, and even small-business people having a (golden parachute)?

The guys at the top of the food chain have worked hard to be educated, well informed and strived to be the very best. Not show up at 7 and stand around until 7:30.
\
Reality is 12 to 15 million illegal immigrants have invaded this country and are sucking the life blood out of this great nation. Many in our state legislatures fail to see that the great social experiment is a failure. Great Briton and many European nations have stated as much.
\
Yet those in power in this state and those in control of the federal governments are still bent on socialism. In finishing, Leopold and Cory Stewart of Prince William County, Va., are a few that understand reality.

Marriage
\
A writer states marriage was designed so that man and woman be joined in love and produce offspring (The Capital, Feb. 28).
\
Gay couples can have offspring as well and should not the right to be married be accorded to them so their ""offspring,"" however they came to be, can have the same protections? The institute of marriage was created as a protection for committed couples and their children; who has the right to say that two people of the same sex cannot be committed in love to each other and their children.
\
Gay relationships have always existed, but have not always been acknowledged. Times have changed and things are out in the open. I cannot see how giving a committed couple, regardless of their sexual orientation, the right to be joined in matrimony will destroy the family. As far as the children with two dads or two moms are concerned they grow up thinking that the way they live is normal for them.
\
Children are very resilient and I do think they can handle seeing other families as different than theirs. Blended families are just one example and have been the norm for quite a while now.
\
Actually, people in traditional marriages have done a great job all on their own of destroying the family, they've needed no help. Let's get real folks and do the right thing.

New curriculum

As a government teacher, I submit the entire government curriculum be rewritten.
\
With the president declaring DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act) unconstitutional and instructing the Justice Department to not enforce it, our entire curriculum is now outdated.
\
This issue is not whether or not you agree with gay marriage, that is beside the point. The point is the executive branch has just done the job of the judicial branch. Checks and balances no longer apply, federalism no longer applies, limited government no longer applies, judicial review no longer applies. There is no reason to teach Marbury v. Madison. I can at least teach precedent because this sets a whole new one. In one fell swoop, in an issue that I am sure will go largely unnoticed and more than likely defended, the very principles of government I am held accountable for teaching are done away with.

I believe the new curriculum should read, ""The end justifies the means."" That is all.

In state Sen. Paul Pinsky's vision, workers in public-private partnerships will sweep through older neighborhoods across Maryland within a few years, fixing windows or installing new ones, replacing thermostats and taking other measures to make homes more energy-efficient.
\
Meanwhile, more Marylanders will get jobs in clean-energy fields, including making and installing solar panels and wind turbines.
\
More jobs, less pollution and lower utility bills.
\
""Talk about a win-win situation - that's it,"" said Pinsky, D-Prince George's.
\
The senator is lead sponsor of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act, which mandates that Maryland cut emission of those pollutants by 25 percent by 2020. The Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee will hold a public hearing on the bill at 1 p.m. Tuesday.
\
Given the long-term challenges of climate change, perhaps no bill being debated this year in Annapolis is as important as this one.
\
Pinsky knows executing this law won't be as simple as the vision he laid out. Some of the state Department of the Environment's 42 plans for meeting the 25 percent goal, like the electricity generation cap-and-trade system, are very complex. Others, like encouraging people to buy more food locally, are relatively simple.
\
This is exactly the kind of thing government needs to do more often: Think long term, set ambitious goals and get beyond the immediate debates over this year's budget and next year's elections (if such a thing is possible).
\
Under the act, MDE would propose a plan by the end of 2011 and there would be public workshops before a final plan's adoption by the end of 2012.
\
Secretary of the Environment Shari Wilson said Maryland would become one of 10 states to have legally committed itself to reduce greenhouse pollution.
\
And if it works in Maryland, our example could help the nation get beyond the false choice between a strong economy and a cleaner planet.
\
A similar bill passed the Senate last year, but died in the House of Delegates in part because of protests from manufacturers and unions who worried the bill would cost Marylanders' jobs.
\
So over the summer, manufacturers, union representatives, environmentalists and state officials met to determine ""a new path forward,"" Wilson said.
\
""Now those people are on board,"" Pinsky said. ""I think this is going to happen.""
\
The bill's backers have made concessions. The manufacturing sector gets a pass, with no emissions reductions required - not a huge problem, since it accounts for only about 4 percent of greenhouse gases. Energy and transportation are the two biggest sources of pollution.
\
Unlike last year, Gov. Martin O'Malley also is throwing his full support behind (and, of course, trying to take credit for) the bill. In the past, he favored it but didn't put his name on it.
\
There are skeptics, of course - people who argue the science on climate change is still unclear. ""Global warming: Was it ever really a crisis?"" is the slogan of a conference for such people being held next month in New York.
\
Wilson, the state's environment secretary, said she hears from skeptics frequently. But she notes there already have been sea-level rises in Maryland.
\
""We know for a fact that our greenhouse gas emissions - man-made - are increasing,"" Wilson said. ""The science today tells us that there's a correlation between (them and climate change). So we have to act.""
\
Think of this logic. If, say, Al Gore is wrong, we'll still have safer domestic energy sources, more efficient transportation and cleaner air. If the other side is wrong, say goodbye to a good chunk of Manhattan, the state of Florida and other major world cities.
\
Which chance would you rather take?

67," Maryland environmentalists praised an air pollution reduction program finalized yesterday by the Bush administration but said stronger local laws are needed because the federal plan doesn't act quickly enough to reduce ozone problems in the state.\ Yesterday, acting EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson signed the Clean Air Interstate Rule, or CAIR, which would expand emissions credit trading programs in Maryland and 27 other states with the goal of reducing nitrogen oxide by 60 percent and sulfur dioxide by 70 percent over the next 15 to 20 years.\ ""CAIR will result in the largest pollution reductions and health benefits of any air rule in more than a decade,"" Johnson said in a written statement. ""The action we are taking will require all 28 states to be good neighbors, helping states downwind by controlling airborne emissions at their source.""\ Several jurisdictions, including Baltimore City and Baltimore, Howard and Anne Arundel counties, are failing federal standards for soot and ozone pollution.\ An EPA analysis shows that the new program will bring all of Maryland into compliance for soot by 2010. But Baltimore City and Howard, Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties, as well as four other counties, will continue to fail ozone standards by 2010, even with the CAIR program.\ The program builds on ""cap-and-trade"" systems the federal government has used since 1990 to provide financial penalties to coal-fired power plants that pollute above specified limits, and cash bonuses to plants whose emissions are below these limits.\ The announcement by the EPA came a day after the U.S. Senate environment committee killed a Bush-endorsed bill called Clear Skies, which would have created a similar cap-and-trade program but would have also gutted sections of the Clean Air Act requiring the installation of filtration equipment, according to critics.\ Brad Heavner, director of an environmental advocacy group called Maryland Public Interest Research Group, said the Clean Air Interstate Rule is better than Clear Skies and will help reduce air pollution in Maryland. But the state still needs to do more to meet federal ozone standards, he said.\ ""It's a step in the right direction, but not enough of a step,"" said Kim Coble, Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\ Because they say the federal program doesn't go far enough, state Sen. Paul G. Pinsky and Del. James W. Hubbard, Democrats from Prince George's County, said yesterday that they will press ahead with bills being debated in the General Assembly that would impose tighter state limits not only on nitrogen and sulfur pollution from power plants in Maryland but also on mercury and carbon dioxide.\ Credit: SUN STAFF"
68,"A federal plan to limit carbon-dioxide emissions would cripple small business, subject Americans to ""reckless taxes"" and increase ""wasteful Washington spending,"" contends House Minority Leader John Boehner.\Does he know that a similar scheme already operates in 10 states from Maryland to Maine? Today, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative will auction off its sixth batch of permits in an effort to reduce power-plant CO2 emissions 10 percent by 2018.\So far, it's costing Maryland families maybe $1.50 a month, according to Baltimore Gas & Electric. It was approved by former Maryland Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican.\Can you feel the tyranny?\The Maryland program is an antidote to the argument that cutting carbon emissions will be oppressive and ruinous. The program sets the stage for substantial carbon-emission reductions, and so far hardly anybody even notices it.\If Congress passes cap-and-trade legislation, if the Copenhagen summit goes anywhere next week, what emerges will be similar to what's already working here.\The debate in Washington over capping carbon emissions ""is like watching a replay of the discussion of [the greenhouse gas initiative] in the states,"" says Shari T. Wilson, Maryland's secretary of the environment.\In today's auction, electricity producers will buy permits to emit carbon over the next eight years. Coal-fired generators will need many permits; natural-gas plants, fewer; and nuclear, solar and wind facilities, none.\The idea, hatched after governors became impatient with federal inertia on climate change, is to put a price on emissions that are expensive for the planet but had been free for energy customers.\Costlier carbon energy will push people to find clean alternatives. Auctioning the permits produces revenue to invest in clean energy and conservation. So far, Maryland has gotten $85 million for adding home insulation, subsidizing residential solar generators and cutting household electric bills.\Such wasteful spending!\It's true that carbon-emission permits will become pricier as limits fall. Constellation Energy, Mirant and other operators of coal-fired generators will have to bid more and pass the price on to customers.\It's also true that a federal cap-and-trade regime would be costlier than the regional compact. Maryland's deal applies only to power-plant emissions - about 35 percent of total carbon dioxide output. Federal legislation would put a price on all businesses' carbon dioxide production.\But the cost won't be as high as many opponents of carbon-control legislation claim. And it won't be nearly as expensive as the bill for dealing with unlimited climate change.\It is shocking that people who call themselves conservative want to sit on their hands in response to global warming. Conservatives are about risk management. They buy insurance. They obey traffic laws. But in the biggest risk of all, they want to do the equivalent of running every red light on U.S. 40 at rush hour.\Don't say the evidence for climate change isn't in. Glaciers, retreating around the world, don't lie.\The federal legislation should be carefully crafted. Diplomats must make sure developing nations also limit carbon output. Give exemptions to important industrial assets such as Severstal's Sparrows Point plant.\The regional initiative is a model for what can happen in Washington and Copenhagen.\""Three out of the 10 [greenhouse gas initiative] states have a Republican governor,"" says Jonathan Schrag, the program's executive director. The initiative ""was proposed by a Republican governor in New York - Governor Pataki. So I think we really are a bipartisan program.""\One that shows that starting to control carbon emissions isn't as scary as some would have you believe."
69,"
More than 100 people are at work on the final draft report of the Maryland Commission on Climate Change.
\
Though a small but vocal group of conservative activists charges that the input of all those people isn't affecting much. Rather, they say a consulting firm, the Center for Climate Strategies, is calling the shots and pushing Maryland to adopt a plan that's a carbon-copy of plans passed by other states.
\
Meanwhile, officials with the state and the center are quick to defend the work as being timely and crucially important.
\
""We decided to work with them because they have staff with a lot of expertise on these issues,"" said state environment Secretary Shari T. Wilson, who also serves as chairman of the climate commission. ""They bring to the table the ability to inform us about what different cities, states and countries are doing.""
\
The disagreement started with frustration over the commission's interim recommendations in November, to slash carbon-dioxide emissions in the state and promote energy efficiency.
\
Then, global-warming critics were galled to find out the center is controlled by another group that makes no bones about its environmental advocacy.
\
Mark Newgent of Baltimore has written extensively about the center and the climate commission on the Red Maryland blog as well as on his personal blog. He said Maryland is getting a raw deal by ""essentially farming out its policy discussions to an advocacy group.""
\
Mr. Newgent said he's not sold on the idea that humans are causing global warming. He also said he thinks the commission's process wasn't carried out in a forthright manner.
\
""I'm nitpicking at the process because we're supposed to have transparent and open government,"" he said.
\
He said he is further irritated by the fact that when he filed a Public Information Act request for documents about the center and the commission, the Maryland Department of the Environment told him he'd have to pay $1,381.40 to get copies.
\
David K. Kyle of Pasadena once ran for the state Senate as a Republican, and now he's a ""conservative independent,"" he said. He, too, said he doesn't like what he's hearing about the climate commission and the center.
\
He said he laments that the commission didn't entertain discussions about global-warming science. There are too many questions about global warming to jump into coming up with ways to combat it, he said.
\
""Their mind was already made up,"" he said.
\
Maryland has not paid for the center's work. When the center works with states - 25 and counting - it often brings its own funding.
\
That's what has some activists concerned - they say that funding comes from left-wing organizations and colors the process.
\
The center's Executive Director Thomas D. Peterson didn't say who is funding the work in Maryland, but said the donors don't influence the work that's being done.
\
""We take the objectivity of our work very seriously,"" Mr. Peterson said.
\
To ensure the report's objectivity, he said donors must give the money with ""no strings attached"" and that there are enough funding sources so that no one source controls a majority of the money.
\
He said the private funding is needed because many states have an interest in developing climate plans but don't have the money to pay for it.
\
""Most states are broke,"" he said. ""It's very difficult for states to mobilize funding for new initiatives if they're not mandated and fully funded.""
\
Paul Chesser, a North Carolina activist who has been working to discredit the center on behalf of the conservative John Locke Foundation, said the center is putting on a repeat performance in state after state.
\
""They're all the same policy ideas,"" he said.
\
Mr. Peterson said his staff has come up with more than 300 possible ways states can reduce greenhouse gases. Each state typically picks about 50 that will work best based on their sources of emissions.
\
The state commissions ""want to learn from what other states have done, but they want to do something that is tailor-made to their state,"" he said.
\
Ms. Wilson, the state environment secretary, said tapping into the center's expertise helped speed up the commission's process.
\
Ms. Wilson said the allegations that the center pushes its own ideas on the commission are false.
\
It's not clear whether the concerns about the center will have any effect on state lawmakers, who will consider several bills that include one of the key recommendations of the climate commission.
\
The central focus will be on the Global Warming Solutions Act, which would require the state to slash emissions and set up a cap- and-trade program for major sources of greenhouse gases.
\
The bill faces an uncertain future. It died without action last year, and so far this year, it hasn't gained the public support of the governor or the leaders of the Senate or the House of Delegates.
\
Mr. Newgent, the blogger from Baltimore, acknowledges there's likely nothing that can be done about the center's consulting deal. But he thinks the Global Warming Solutions Act can be stopped.
\
""I hope it's not too late,"" he said.

70,"
At St. Philip's Episcopal Church in Annapolis this morning, members will spruce up their rain garden.
\
And at St. Martin's-in-the-Field Episcopal Church and School in Severna Park, there will be a community festival today to highlight environmentally-friendly practices - complete with Chessie, a 30-foot creature made from recycled cans and bottles.
\
The activities are among those that churches are holding to coincide with the 38th annual celebration of Earth Day, which falls on Tuesday.
\
Earth Day is no longer a holiday just for ""greenies"" or ""hippies,"" and faith communities are among those honoring the Earth, not just on Earth Day, but throughout the year.
\
Tomorrow, members of the Unitarian Universalist Church in Annapolis will reflect on their connections with the environment and consider eating more locally-grown food. Across town, St. Anne's Parish will hold an eco-celebration.
\
For many faith communities, picking up on eco-themes is part of respecting and protecting God's creation.
\
Many Christian churches trace their environmental work to the Book of Genesis, in which God creates the Earth and mankind, as well as the Psalms, which are full of praise for God and his creation.
\
""God created the earth and gave it to humans to take care of,"" said the Rev. Angela Shepherd, rector of St. Philip's. ""If we don't take our responsibility to think of those who come after us, what a selfish way to live life.""
\
In addition to the rain garden, St. Philip's offers paper recycling for members. The next project will be replacing old light bulbs with new, energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs.
\
The Unitarian Universalist Church has done so many environmental projects that a few years ago it earned designation as a ""Green Sanctuary"" from the national organization.
\
Judy Graham has been involved in environmental efforts at the church, including heading up the effort to plant a rain garden that drains and filters stormwater runoff from the parking lot.
\
""We're all responsible for the world and everything is connected, everything has consequences ... We all need to take care of the world. It's our home,"" she said.
\
Likewise, Arnold resident Lisa Gilbert has been working to spread the environmental message at First Presbyterian Church in Annapolis.
\
The Gilbert family members have been longtime recyclers who also raise oysters and are putting in a nitrogen-reducing septic system. They were spurred to do even more after seeing the film ""An Inconvenient Truth.""
\
The growing environmental awareness in the Gilbert family coincided with Mrs. Gilbert becoming a trustee at First Presbyterian.
\
And around the same time, a guest speaker before the church trustees imparted the message that not only are trustees responsible for the church itself, but ""You're also a steward for the gifts God has given you,"" Mrs. Gilbert recalled.
\
Everything clicked and Mrs. Gilbert set about trying to convince her fellow church members that First Presbyterian needed to be greened up. Last year, she arranged for Annapolis Mayor Ellen O. Moyer to give a slide show presentation on ""An Inconvenient Truth.""
\
Now she's suggesting the church consider greener options: organic gardening, improved recycling, eco-tips in the church bulletin, maybe even geothermal heating and cooling.
\
""I feel it's important - every small change we make can lead to a bigger impact,"" she said. ""I feel it's something we have a responsibility to do as Christians.""
\
Quakers who belong to the Annapolis Friends Meeting have struggled to cope with how to accommodate their growing membership in a responsible and environmental way, said Barbara Thomas of Deale, who is the group's clerk, a position akin to a coordinator or trustee.
\
A ""growing and greening"" committee is learning about porous pavers, geothermal energy, solar power and more in preparation for a likely expansion of the building.
\
""The famous Quaker saying that guides us is: 'There's that of God in every person.' So you want to be sure not to hurt God's children or offend God's creation,"" she said.
\
The trend of churches going green isn't unique to the Annapolis area. National church organizations have spoken out on issues such as global warming and reducing pollution.
\
Faith leaders ranging from Pope Benedict XVI to those in the Southern Baptist Convention have called on their members to get active in environmental causes.
\
Local Catholics are heeding the pope's call. St. Mary's Catholic Church in downtown Annapolis applied for a grant to control stormwater runoff from the parking lot. And at St. John Neumann Catholic Church, there will be a special Mass focused on the environment with discussion afterward at 5 p.m. tomorrow.
\
But not all faith leaders agree on the issues.
\
Last month, some evangelical leaders signed on to a letter to U.S. senators urging them to reject a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions. In the letter they said the trading system would produce little positive environmental effect while having negative effects on the economy and the poor.
\
Unitarian Universalist practice reflects a slightly different view than some other religions.
\
Rather than having responsibility over the Earth, Unitarian Universalists see themselves as part of the Earth. One of the seven principles of Unitarian Universalism is: ""Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.""
\
Despite the differing philosophies, the end result is similar: the Unitarian Universalist church has an array of projects aimed at improving the environment and raising awareness among members.
\
""For the vast majority of Unitarian Universalists, they understand our relationship to nature and the ramifications of what that means,"" said the Rev. Fred Muir of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Annapolis. ""Things are always in flux and changing. We are a part of nature and not masters of nature.""
"
71,"Gov. Martin O'Malley's energy administration will release sweeping legislative and policy recommendations today that include new power-conservation laws, an estimated $100 million fund for environment-friendly initiatives and an emphasis on consumer responsibility for electricity consumption.\O'Malley, a Democrat who campaigned on the unfulfilled promise of undoing a 72 percent electricity rate increase for 1.2 million Baltimore Gas & Electric customers, appears likely to pursue an agenda in Annapolis that could further increase consumer costs in the short term. But administration officials say the proposals are needed to ensure long-term sustainability of Maryland's faltering power network and forestall the threat of blackouts as early as 2011.\""It's very likely that a number of the proposals in the energy plan will be included in the governor's package"" to the legislature this session, said O'Malley spokesman Rick Abbruzzese. He said the governor's energy bills will be introduced this week or next week.\The plan is likely to cheer environmental groups, many of whom felt shunned during the administration of Republican Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. Among the key elements:\Creating a ""strategic energy investment fund"" paid for by electricity companies that would invest in energy-efficient technologies and promote nonpolluting power alternatives.\Asking lawmakers to pass a bill codifying Maryland's goal of reducing overall electricity consumption by 15 percent by 2015, based on 2007 usage.\Requiring the state's utility companies to buy 20 percent of their power from wind, solar or other renewable sources by 2022 - and doubling the penalties for companies that do not.\In addition to legislation, the O'Malley administration is endorsing the strategy adopted last month by the Public Service Commission, which regulates the power industry, of stronger state intervention in how utilities purchase power.\A recent PSC report said Maryland residents face the prospect of rolling blackouts within three years if nothing is done to address an energy shortage in the state. Maryland now imports about 30 percent of its electricity, endangering the reliability of an aging transmission system.\PSC Chairman Steven B. Larsen said the administration's plans are a ""recognition that the state is finally generating action around a serious problem,"" but he cautioned that Marylanders must moderate their energy consumption if the state is to keep its lights on without damaging the environment.\""There's no question we're going to have to get customers used to the idea that they're going to have to also take steps to help address the issue,"" Larsen said. ""If they're looking to go back to the days of cheap, plentiful, endless supplies of electricity with no impact on the environment, I do think those days are over.""\To reward consumers for reducing their electricity use and investing in energy-efficient technologies, administration officials are proposing an array of incentives and subsidies paid by the energy fund, such as issuing rebates to customers who purchase more efficient appliances.\The fund will not rely on tax revenue. Instead, the governor is banking on proceeds from the auction of so-called pollution credits under an initiative of 10 states to voluntarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\Under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, power plants must keep emissions below a downward-sliding limit, or buy credits from cleaner power plants.\Brandon Farris, policy director of the Maryland Energy Administration, said Maryland expects to receive about $100 million a year from the sale of its pollution credits, though the yield won't be known until the first auction this summer. Larsen said the amount could be twice as high.\But Del. Warren E. Miller, a Howard County Republican on the House Economic Matters Committee, said he doubted that the ""cap and trade"" system would create even a $100 million windfall, and that added costs borne by power plants would probably show up on consumers' electrical bills.\""I have a fear that's going to be passed on to Maryland electrical consumers,"" Miller said. ""The cost to our consumers should trump everything else.""\A spokesman for Constellation Energy Group, the corporate parent of BGE, said the utility would maintain a ""thoughtful and constructive dialogue"" with the legislature and the O'Malley administration, but declined to answer specific questions about the electricity plan.\O'Malley officials acknowledge that power companies probably would pass on to consumers the costs of buying pollution credits, which would in turn drive up electricity bills unless the added costs are offset by reduced usage.\That's why the governor wants to use the fund to make it easier for consumers to lower energy consumption, Abbruzzese said.\But recent tax increases and economic uncertainty might spur a fight in the legislature this session if lawmakers prefer to give all or some of the $100 million back to consumers.\""I'm sure that point of view will be represented in Annapolis,"" Abbruzzese said. ""This will be debated.""\Sen. Thomas M. Middleton, a Southern Maryland Democrat who chairs a committee that handles utility issues, said protecting fixed-income and poor residents would be a high priority. ""If we've got $100 million, we've got to take care of those folks,"" he said.\Johanna Neumann, policy advocate for the Maryland Public Interest Research Group, said she hopes the legislature will resist the temptation to directly refund the sale of pollution credits to consumers.\""I could see the political advantage of rebating the money,"" she said, ""but by actually investing ... in energy efficiencies, consumers will see greater benefits and greater savings, because we will able to avoid blackouts, future rate shocks and avoid costly new transmission lines.""\In anticipation of the extensive rate increases in 2007, some environmental and consumer groups have called for the state to buy or build its own power plants, arguing that the landmark deregulation of the industry in 1999 had clearly failed.\The plan released today calls on the PSC to continue studying the creation of a Maryland Power Authority, but recommends no immediate action. Consultants hired by the commission have said it would cost $18 billion to $24 billion for Maryland utilities to buy back power plants they relinquished during deregulation.\Sean Dobson, the executive director of left-leaning Progressive Maryland, said lawmakers should give O'Malley's plan a chance to work.\""But if it turns out to be insufficient,"" he said, ""the state should construct, own and operate its own ultra-efficient, clean-energy power plants and force utilities to pass along this electricity to consumers at a regulated, affordable rate.""\gadi.dechter@baltsun.com\Credit: SUN REPORTER"
72,"Republican presidential candidates wasted no time in decrying President Barack Obama's new regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants in nearly apocalyptic terms. Among those running for president, Sen. Marco Rubio predicted ""catastrophic"" increases in electric bills, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said the rules would ""throw countless people out of work,"" and Sen. Ted Cruz called the plan a ""lawless and radical attempt to destabilize the nation's energy system.""\Who would possibly stand to live under the kind of regulations Mr. Obama is pushing? If you read The Sun, chances are you already do. \The president's plan will create state-based caps on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants that will amount to a 32 percent reduction of 2005 levels by 2030. Though it doesn't explicitly tell states how to achieve that, the plan is expected to strongly encourage state or regional cap-and-trade systems in which a price is set on carbon emissions and polluters are required to buy credits to cover their activities, with the proceeds reinvested in energy efficiency, carbon-free electric generation and rate credits for consumers, among other things. Maryland and eight other northeastern states have been doing that since 2008 through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, better known as RGGI. \When it comes to reducing emissions from power plants, cap- and-trade works. The RGGI states have achieved a greater than 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions over 2005 levels. In fact, the efforts have been so successful that the consortium last year decided to cut its allowances even further because demand for the carbon credits had plummeted as a result of the switch from coal to natural gas, energy efficiency and other factors. The states are now on track to achieve a 50 percent reduction in power plant CO2 emissions by 2020. \Untangling the impact of RGGI on consumers' electric bills would be a difficult task, given that the collaborative's existence has coincided with the shale gas boom, which has driven down the cost of generation, and with the recession, which helped reduce demand. But it is safe to say it has not led to anything like the doomsday the president's critics are predicting. Average electric bills in the RGGI states have declined by 8 percent since 2008 during a period when the national average bill has not changed. Whatever the cost of the pollution credits, they have been more than made up for by investments in energy efficiency. \And what about the region's economy? A third-party analysis this summer pegged RGGI's benefits at $1.3 billion for the nine states and estimated that RGGI had created 14,000 new jobs. \President Obama's Clean Power Plan is sure to spark vigorous court challenges, particularly from the coal industry, but the bigger risk may be political. Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and former Gov. Martin O'Malley have both praised the plan, but given the influence on the Republican field of special interests who oppose action on climate change, starting with the Koch brothers, we're likely to see a fight among GOP hopefuls over who can denounce it in the strongest terms. As Mr. Obama is proposing to act under the existing authority of the 1970 Clean Air Act, a future president could derail the new rules by slowing or stopping their implementation. \But the experience of Maryland and the eight other RGGI states suggests they would be foolish to do so. Republican former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. initially kept Maryland out of RGGI for fear that it would drive up electric rates and cause rolling brownouts or blackouts, but by the end of his term, he signed a law that required Maryland's participation. Nearly a decade later, Maryland has a new Republican governor, Larry Hogan, and he's making no move to pull the state out of RGGI. Being part of RGGI ""has been useful,"" Ben Grumbles, Mr. Hogan's secretary of the environment, said in a recent interview with The Sun's editorial board. ""It was smart for the state to have been involved."" \Though opponents are blasting Mr. Obama's action as a federal over-reach, the experience of the RGGI states demonstrates it's anything but. It uses the principles of the market to solve a problem in a way that benefits the economy as a whole. It works here, and there's no reason to believe it won't work for the rest of the nation.\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
73,"
When Duke Energy Corp. CEO James E. Rogers considers global warming, he sees more than a costly quagmire for the U.S. power industry; he sees grand monuments. Notre Dame in Paris, St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
\
Rogers has adopted what he calls ""cathedral thinking,"" a view that tackling climate change is a chance for the industry to leave a proud environmental legacy for future generations.
\
This philosophy may not deliver results as quickly as environmentalists would like, or sit well with all his counterparts, but it does aptly describe an approach toward reducing greenhouse gases that a small but growing number of power executives are embracing.
\
""The science says we need to act,"" Mr. Rogers said. Of course, shifting political winds are an equally persuasive force in an industry that accounts for almost 40 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.
\
Mr. Rogers and many other executives are convinced the United States is likely to join Europe in placing limits on carbon dioxide emissions - believed by scientists to cause global warming - perhaps as early as next decade. This rising expectation of mandatory carbon caps is reviving interest in nuclear power, accelerating the use cleaner coal-burning technologies and spurring investment in alternative fuels such as wind and biomass.
\
Some of the country's biggest power producers are even setting voluntary greenhouse-gas reduction goals now in hopes of gaining a competitive edge down the road.
\
""The first movers now kind of realize... there will be a carbon regime in this country,"" said Peter Fusaro, chairman of Global Change Associates and a longtime proponent of clean energy. ""This is not just talk,"" he added.
\
Despite good intentions, however, it will likely be several decades before any meaningful progress is made on reducing carbon emissions, according to experts on energy and the environment. That is because half the country's electricity comes from burning coal - by far the largest industrial source of carbon dioxide - and the most promising technology for capturing these emissions and sequestering them underground is still in the experimental phase.
\
Meantime, the Edison Electric Institute, the industry's main trade association, is lobbying to prevent mandatory carbon caps, calling them an unnecessary financial burden at a time when the power industry needs to invest billions just to meet anticipated demand.
\
U.S. electricity demand is expected to rise by about 1.5 percent a year, resulting in a 50 percent increase from current levels by 2030. Factor in the anticipated industrialization of China, India and other developing nations, and the global rate of growth for electricity demand is even higher.
\
The Electric Power Research Institute forecasts that, with today's technology, global carbon dioxide emissions will more than double by 2050 to 80 billion metric tons a year. The U.S. already accounts for more than 7 billion tons a year.
\
""The issue is global warming, not U.S. warming,"" said Mike Morris, the chief executive of American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio, the largest coal-burning utility in the country. Unless China, India and other developing nations also are forced to adopt costly alternatives to traditional fossil fuels, U.S. manufacturers - a major customer for AEP - will be at an unfair competitive disadvantage, Mr. Morris said.
\
But Mr. Morris has a pragmatic side as well, which is why AEP is part of a small group of companies that has voluntarily agreed to cap their carbon emissions in the United States as part of an experimental market that is based in Chicago.
\
In California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last month signed legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants to 1990 levels by 2020.
\
In the Northeast, a regional ""cap and trade"" system of buying and selling emissions allowances is being developed to cut greenhouse gases from Maine to Delaware.
\
And more than 20 states require utilities to buy a share of their electricity from renewables such as wind, solar and geothermal energy.
\
Some opponents of mandatory carbon caps say the power industry would be better off with one federal standard than a hodgepodge of state regulations with which to comply. But, either way, the basic principle of putting a price on carbon is gaining traction: the Congressional Budget Office said last month that any cost-effective U.S. policy on global warming will require emissions taxes or a cap and trade system similar to Europe's.
\
It is against this backdrop of legislative activity at the state level - and with help from federal tax breaks included in last year's energy bill - that some utilities are tweaking their long- term strategies.
\
David Crane, the head of Princeton, N.J.-based NRG Energy, said at a recent conference that the industry's long-standing attitude of ""see no carbon, hear no carbon, speak no carbon"" is increasingly out of touch with mainstream American values.
\
Mr. Crane, who oversaw NRG's July acquisition of wind-farm developer Padoma Wind Power, predicted that ""companies and industries which deny the issue will be marginalized.""
\
The growing long-term appeal of carbon-free power in the U.S. is exemplified by the phenomenal growth of wind power, which has quadrupled since 2000 to more than 10,000 megawatts nationwide. That said, wind still represents less than 1 percent of all U.S. power capacity.
\
Perhaps more telling is the resurgence of interest in the U.S. for nuclear power, whose image was battered by the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and bruised by the Chernobyl accident in 1986. Concerns about nuclear waste also run high.
\
But sensing that public resistance to nuclear will wane as concerns about global warming rise, more than a dozen companies, including Duke, NRG, Entergy Corp. and Exelon Corp., have notified the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission that they plan to apply for licenses to build new reactors.
\
Notifications began pouring in after Congress passed an energy bill last summer that included tax credits and other perks to encourage nuclear power, which is also seen as a way to become less reliant on high and volatile natural-gas prices.
\
Constellation Energy Group Inc. of Baltimore, in a partnership with France's Areva called UniStar Nuclear, is considering building five new reactors, including one each at existing nuclear facilities in Maryland and New York.
\
For Constellation, nuclear is ""the most preferred energy supply of the future,"" said Mike Wallace, head of the company's power- generation division.
\
If all goes smoothly, the first new reactor in the U.S. since the mid-1970s could be completed within 10 years, analysts and industry officials said.
\
While nuclear presents a significant opportunity in the fight against carbon emissions, the country's unbridled dependence on traditional coal is a major obstacle.
\
More than 150 new coal plants have been proposed in the U.S., which has the world's largest coal reserves. And while there is much optimism about the long-term potential for ""clean coal"" technology, it will only be used in about 10 percent of the plants currently on the drawing board.
\
Even these so-called coal gasification plants will not solve global warming overnight. While they are far more efficient than older coal plants, the real promise rests in their compatibility with emissions-capture equipment. Unfortunately, ""a laundry list of technical challenges"" could take a decade or more to resolve, according to Revis James, director of EPRI's technology assessment division.
\
The dearth of simple carbon-free solutions leaves an executive like Duke's Mr. Rogers in a difficult position. Sure, he is making plans to add nuclear and coal-gasification power plants, but an important aspect of ""cathedral thinking"" is a recognition that addressing global warming requires immediate action.
\
For that reason, Mr. Rogers is promoting the need for greater energy efficiency whenever he can.
\
But in order for that to succeed, Rogers said elected officials and regulators will have to come up with financial incentives that will encourage utilities to sell less electricity.
\
""Hope,"" he said, ""is not a plan.""

74,"
Lesko letter
\
In his letter (The Capital, July 23) Bill Lesko makes several factual errors.
\
Among others, Mr. Lesko asserts that President Obama started the war in Afghanistan. In fact, President Bush started the war in Afghanistan in response to the attacks of 9 / 11. Before that war was completed, Bush decided to invade and occupy Iraq. Those two wars did not begin during the Obama administration. Mr. Obama is trying to end them. Of the two wars, the one in Afghanistan is the one that made sense. That country gave aid and shelter to the people who attacked us. The one in Iraq was one that fulfilled part of a neoconservative dream, deposing Saddam Hussein. The part left unfinished was winning the war.
\
As for the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court, Lesko misstates history again. That she was ""slapped down by the Supreme Court for her prejudicial views"" simply did not happen. If Lesko is referring to the case of the firefighters, he misunderstood what happened. Sotomayor, as part of a three-judge decision, upheld existing law. Activist conservative justices of the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision created new law, which Sotomayor could not have known about.
\
Lesko got one thing right: Obama promised us change. Although Lesko might not like it, Obama is now president and is bringing the change he promised. That change will take time. During the election, conservative Republicans accused then-Sen. Obama of acting like ""the messiah."" Now that he is president, they criticize him because he isn't using divine power to instantly undo the colossal mess he inherited.

Health care reform
\
Congressman Frank Kratovil faces a test to determine his political future in his conservative district: whether to support the governmental power-grab masquerading as ""health care reform.""
\
Pending congressional bills will only restrict our personal health care options. The proposed ""nonprofit insurance co-op"" is a first step toward single-payer, government-run health care. With its losses covered by taxpayers, and with bureaucrats regulating and taxing insurance alternatives, the government co-op would wipe out competitors, forcing us all into a ""single payer"" government monopoly.
\
Kratovil says he wants reform that ""effectively expands health insurance coverage, reduces costs, increases access, improves quality and is deficit neutral."" That is impossible. The Congressional Budget Office stresses that you cannot expand subsidized coverage to 47 million more consumers without exploding costs and deficits.
\
As the Hudson Institute notes, ""CBO's analysis shows quite clearly that the net effect of these health care 'reforms' is to dig the financial hole in federal health care programs deeper - by $820 billion over the next decade."" In short, the ""cost-containment"" argument is a complete fraud.
\
Political interference also will lead to reduced health care quality. The only way that government could reduce costs would be to slash payments to hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturers and doctors. The consequence of such payment squeezes would be to create shortages in these areas. Hospitals would eliminate services and facilities; doctors would cut their hours or leave medical practice entirely; drug companies would lose the capital to invest in new medicines and cures.
\
Hawaii, Tennessee and Massachusetts have already conducted disastrous experiments incorporating similar ""reforms."" Results? Exploding costs, less choice, reduced competition, plunging quality and soaring deficits.
\
Inform Kratovil what political cost he will bear if he supports the disastrous health care ""reforms"" emerging from Congress.

Fact checking
\
Before you professional Obama-bashers next take up your pens or plunk yourselves down at your keyboards, why don't you take a minute to check that scandalous nugget of information that just came your way via friends, relative or Internet?
\
While this would deprive The Capital of a few preposterous letters, we would be rewarded with a more polite, civil and - most importantly - factual editorial environment, while being spared the all-too-frequent, unpleasant invective.
\
Example: Lester Shockey, while assailing the admittedly misguided energy bill now before Congress (The Capital, July 9), fails to quit while ahead and proceeds to accuse the current administration of seeking to overturn the 22nd Amendment, so as to ensure a lifetime presidency for the incumbent. However, a visit to fact versus rumor sites on the Internet would have revealed that while such legislation has indeed been proposed by a (yes, Democratic) Congressman from New York, he has done so seven times in the past, first when George Bush was president.
\
In fact, a number of members of the House and Senate - among them Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kan., and various colleagues - have put such a bill forward, irrespective of who was in the White House.
\
Fortunately, it has never been taken seriously, having yet to even be heard in committee, let alone by the full body, thereby languishing in deserved obscurity with little likelihood of ever reaching the states for ratification. Neither, as should be evident, is there a shred of evidence that this administration is involved in any way.
\
So, please, all of you from both political extremes, make that extra keystroke and do some digging (Snopes, Factcheck, wherever). We will all well, a lot of us anyway appreciate it immensely.

Cap and trade
\
If you think your electric bill is high and that gas prices are going up, you haven't seen anything yet. When and if the Senate passes the so-called ""Cap and Trade"" bill, expect the price of electricity and gas to go sky high. The price of everything is going up if this exceptionally bad piece of legislation passes and jobs are going to be lost. And what do we get in return? Nothing.
\
Contrary to what the extremists say, global warming or rapid climate change or whatever you want to call it is not a scientific certainty. More and more scientists and climate experts are showing that the computer models being used to support this theory are terribly flawed and the real facts do not agree with the conclusions. Please see. Dr. Ian Plimer's book ""Heaven and Earth.""
\
The so-called scientific consensus is falling apart. Let's look at a few facts. The earth's temperatures have flat lined since 2001, despite growing concentrations of CO2. Water vapor is responsible for 95 percent and CO2 for 3.5 percent of greenhouse warming. When natural CO2 is subtracted, then man-made CO2 contributes just 0.117 percent. That is 0.117 percent of the total greenhouse effect, probably too small to detect any change even if we eliminate half of the man-made CO2. This doesn't mean we might not see a rise in global temperatures. It means that man-made CO2 is not responsible. Add to this the fact that China and India are not on board with this folly and it's easy to see that what is being proposed for political reasons is nonsense.
\
At election time keep in mind that any Congressman who voted for the bill should not be returned to office.

Assets
\
Our assets are our children. We have no greater. No matter who parented them, if they are American, they are our country's assets, and they are worthy of investment in their future. The best way to grow the value of that asset is by providing good health care and a growing level of education.
\
Forget the suppositions that the only people without insurance are those who choose it. We must decrease our cost but, at the same time, we must make it available to everyone.
\
46 million Americans (18 percent) under age 65 are without health insurance. Of those, 80 percent are native or naturalized American citizens. That is 37 million.
\
If you consider that some become uninsured for various reasons including unemployment, during 2006-07, 90 million became uninsured at some time.
\
10.7 percent of all U.S. children in 2007 were not insured.
\
These are incredible numbers for our assets. I do not believe that these people never get sick or injured. Therefore it would stand to reason that someone is paying for their health care or paying for their lack of health care. Who might that be?
\
Would it not be a wiser investment of our dollars to provide health care and by the same process preventative health care? Would that not get us a higher return on our investment?
\
We can create a plan to do this.

E-ZPass
\
It's not EZ for me to swallow an additional fee for using a Maryland E-ZPass. The illogical decision by the Maryland Transportation Authority to tack on a surcharge for those improving gridlock, reducing pollution and conserving fuel, instead of increasing fees for those not willing to take a few minutes to purchase a pass, is insulting.
\
The easy solution is to do what I and others have done; cancel your Maryland EZ-pass (888-321-6824) and purchase one from Virginia (877-762-7824), where people aren't penalized for doing the right thing.

75,"As energy prices soar and global warming awareness grows, more Americans are buying hybrid cars, outfitting their homes with low-energy light bulbs and worrying about the distance their food travels from farm to plate. But when it comes to air travel, how many pay attention to the jet fuel their flights consume and the carbon emissions those planes generate?\Though aviation represents only 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, that share is likely to rise as air traffic grows - the Federal Aviation Administration says commercial flights in the U.S. alone will increase 60 percent by 2030. Passenger jets are about a third more fuel-efficient today than those built 40 years ago, and their design continues to improve. But worldwide traffic growth is projected to outstrip efficiency improvements, leading to an increase of carbon dioxide emissions from aviation of 3 percent to 4 percent per year, according to the 2007 report of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\Adding to concerns is the nature of aircraft emissions. Because nitrous oxide pollutants are discharged at such high altitudes, damage to the ozone layer is amplified and the cloud-like contrails formed have an additional heat-trapping effect.\Together, those factors may bring new regulatory and economic pressures on airlines.\""Going forward, climate change could be the most significant challenge facing aviation,"" said Daniel K. Elwell, the FAA's assistant administrator for aviation policy, planning and the environment. ""We could run up against environmental limits to aviation growth before we run into actual concrete infrastructure limits at airports.""\Already, the European Union is pushing for international airlines to pay for the carbon gases they produce. The move has tensions simmering across the Atlantic. Europe's nascent cap-and-trade system would be expanded to limit the amount of carbon dioxide airlines could release, saddling them with extra costs if they exceed those caps and allowing them to sell off credits if fuel consumption is reduced.\But the method for regulating aviation emissions is complicated, because the pollutants are largely produced outside neat national borders.\Major U.S. airlines, represented by the Air Transport Association, have balked at any regulation proposal. With oil pushing the $130-a-barrel mark, the carriers argue that jet fuel prices - their largest expense - act as a carbon tax, providing all the incentive they need to conserve.\The federal government also maintains that Europe's unilateral plan could violate international aviation treaties.\Regardless, the next U.S. president will face mounting pressure to adopt cap-and-trade legislation that includes aviation. Recently, the Senate killed the proposed Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act, which would have forced refineries to pay for the carbon dioxide emitted in fuel production, a cost they would likely have passed on to airlines and other petroleum-dependent industries.\""The notion that any substantial sector can be excused is unlikely,"" said Jonathan Pershing, a U.S. and international climate change policy expert at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental think tank. ""Aviation emissions are growing faster than any other transportation sector and ultimately will account for as much 5 percent of global emissions unless those are accounted for or curtailed. It's bigger than steel.""\Rising fuel prices have forced airlines to enact conservation measures that have the side benefit of curbing emissions. In March, Southwest Airlines started flying at slower speeds, a remedy Northwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways also employ. Slowing down adds just minutes to flying times but could save Southwest 18 million gallons of jet fuel this year, said a company spokeswoman, Whitney Eichinger.\Southwest also uses its now-iconic curved winglets to reduce drag on its newer Boeing 737-700s and some of its older 737-300s. Other airlines, including AirTran Airways, have installed the winglets, creating fuel savings of 3 to 4 percent on an average 737-700 flight, the Air Transport Association said.\Anything airlines can do to limit the idling of aircraft engines on the taxiway helps. American Airlines has its aircraft taxi on one engine whenever possible and, similar to Southwest and AirTran, uses ground power instead of the plane's unit to provide electricity and air conditioning at many gates.\Financially strapped airlines such as American, Delta and United plan to retire some aging, gas-draining planes. But the economic slowdown also means carriers have delayed or canceled the delivery of new, more fuel-efficient planes.\Commercial service on Boeing's new 787 jetliners won't debut until the third quarter of 2009, a delivery date pushed back three times. The 787 is the first jumbo jet to be built primarily of lighter carbon-fiber composites, requiring 20 percent less fuel than a comparable aluminum-bodied plane, Boeing says. So far, few of the orders for the 787 jetliners are from U.S. carriers.Until Congress upgrades the nation's 1950s-era air traffic control system to fully support satellite navigation, airlines have less motivation to purchase newly outfitted planes, said Elwell of the FAA.\Planes will be able to fly closer together on more direct routes under the system, reducing fuel burn. Improvements have already come as the required vertical distance between planes flying in the stratosphere was halved to 1,000 feet in 2005, he said. The FAA also opened up new routes recently over the Atlantic Ocean to allow planes to fly more efficient trips from New York to the Caribbean.\The satellite technology would also reduce emissions and noise generated during arrivals, by allowing aircraft to remain at higher altitudes longer and use less power as they descend toward a destination, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report. Overall, full implementation of the new ""NextGen"" air traffic control system could reduce aviation emissions up to 12 percent by 2025, according to the FAA.\Alternative fuels to jet kerosene aren't yet a viable solution. But the race is on. Plane maker Airbus and manufacturer Honeywell International Inc. recently said they are developing an algae-based biofuel that could power nearly a third of commercial aircraft worldwide by 2030.\Virgin Atlantic earned bragging rights in February with the world's first biofuel-powered commercial flight, a passenger-less jumbo jet partially fueled on an edible cocktail of coconut and babassu nut oil. In 2009, Continental Airlines and Boeing are scheduled to make the first U.S. commercial test, using a more advanced blend of biofuels.\In the meantime, what's a green-minded traveler to do? Take more efficient rail or bus transportation for short-haul trips. Pay for nonstop flights, as extra take-offs and landings guzzle fuel. But don't pay for business class. The more people packed into coach, the more efficient the flight.\On a trip from Baltimore to New York City, flying would generate twice as many carbon emissions as driving in a compact car, according to NativeEnergy.com, which handles carbon offsets. But a longer flight to Boston would generate .079 tons of CO2, compared to .101 tons CO2 from the drive.\You can pay a carbon-offsetting group to reduce emissions equal to the amount a trip generates. The money helps fund wind farms or solar panel installations, for example. Some airlines even allow customers to purchase offsets as they book tickets online.\Silver Spring-based Carbonfund.org has a new partnership with JetBlue to sell offsets directly to its passengers.\""Airlines understand that theirs is an industry where it's a lot more difficult to reduce carbon,"" said Eric Carlson, Carbonfund.org's founder and a former Environmental Protection Agency employee. ""They realize that their consumers want green options, and that there are things they can do to reduce their emissions, and then they want to offer the opportunity to offset the rest.""\But since the offset industry is unregulated, it's difficult for consumers to determine which organizations live up to their claims.\Nor is any voluntary program likely to account for all the pollutants generated by such a huge industry.\""Offsets are not the overall solution,"" said Pershing. ""Ultimately we have to figure out how to reduce emissions in aviation - not let aviation pay for somebody else to reduce emissions.""\Laura.mccandlish@baltsun.com\Credit: Sun reporter"
76,"SEE HARD COPY FOR CHART\ If Marylanders want to fight global warming, they're going to have to sweat. They may have to pay more for electricity, throw out their inefficient air conditioners, drive smaller cars and accept new nuclear reactors.\ Such an unprecedented shift might seem almost un-American, in its rejection of SUV's and embrace of a long-feared power source. And it could end up more of a political statement than an action that could actually save Baltimore's waterfront from flooding.\ California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger recently launched his state on an unprecedented program to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020, and Maryland lawmakers are debating whether to follow.\ Meanwhile, Texas is racing to build 17 new coal-fired power plants before the Democrats who now control Congress can impose limits on carbon dioxide. The new Lone Star smokestacks would churn out 2.6 times more CO2 than the California plan would eliminate, according to the Sierra Club. Not to mention the bad air rising from China and India - which have joined the U.S., the world's biggest polluter, in refusing to cut global warming gases.\ So why should Maryland politicians sweat? Why should they step out on a limb and inflict discomfort on local voters that people in Shanghai and San Antonio don't feel?\ State Sen. Paul G. Pinsky, a Democrat from Prince George's County, said the only way to force the federal government to act is for a growing number of states, including Maryland, to follow California instead of Texas.\ ""The rest of the world isn't going to act on climate change until the major perpetrators - including us - start walking the walk, instead of just talking the talk,"" said Pinsky, chairman of the Maryland Senate environmental matters subcommittee. ""Then some of the less developed countries will start being responsible. Remember, Shanghai is on the coast, too. So they also will be under pressure to act"" on global warming and the rising sea levels caused by climate change, he said.\ Pinsky and House Majority Leader Kumar P. Barve, a Democrat from Montgomery County, introduced a bill last week called ""The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006."" The law would require Maryland to follow California's mandate that all industries cut their emissions of greenhouse gases by a quarter over 13 years, bringing them back to 1990 levels.\ The enforcement mechanism would be determined by an Office of Climate Change to be created within the Maryland Department of the Environment. Most likely it would be a cap-and-trade system that would impose pollution limits on all businesses, but make carbon dioxide credits a commodity that could be sold or swapped. The result would be that industries that want to exceed the pollution limits would have to pay penalties to cleaner businesses, such as firms that build wind turbines.\ Pinsky admits that the bill is a long shot this year, with less support than another measure to limit greenhouse gases, the so- called ""clean cars"" legislation that has been endorsed by Gov. Martin O'Malley and leaders of the Senate and House. This law is more limited, focusing only on cars and light trucks, which produce about a quarter of the gases that scientists have concluded cause global warming.\ But Pinsky said momentum is growing for more sweeping action, with new scientific evidence of climate change and Congress debating federal legislation.\ Pinsky has a track record of success, as a lead sponsor of Maryland's Healthy Air Act, which passed by a wide margin last spring after failing twice in previous years. This law aims to cut pollution from coal-fired power plants by more than two-thirds, including a 10 percent reduction in global warming gases by 2018. Power plants generate about a third of greenhouse gases, with the rest coming from other businesses, homes, farms and other sources.\ ""We want to create incentives for clean energy, because dirty energy is going to kill all of us - particularly all of us who live in Maryland, where we have many areas that will be under water in 30, 40 or 50 years,"" said Pinsky.\ The passage of both the clean cars bill and the Global Warming Solutions Act might be a step in the right direction, but they would not come close to stopping climate change. If the whole world followed Maryland and California in approving similar legislation, it would only provide a fraction of the more than 70 percent reductions in greenhouse gases by 2050 that many scientists say would be necessary to stabilize the Earth's atmosphere.\ Jeffrey R. Holmstead, assistant administrator for air programs at the Bush administration's Environmental Protection Agency from 2001 to 2005, said following California's model would hurt the economy without helping the environment.\ ""It doesn't matter if a gas is emitted in Baltimore or Beijing, it has a uniform effect throughout the globe,"" said Holmstead, who now represents the power industry. ""So it's possible that a city or state could impose very costly restrictions on its own industries, and yet accomplish very little or nothing.""\ Daniel Kirk-Davidoff, an assistant professor of atmospheric and oceanic science at the University of Maryland, College Park, said that the effect of greenhouse gases on the climate is clearly a global issue, not unique to Maryland.\ ""But Maryland is a bit special because we're on the coast, and we have a huge shoreline - that makes us particularly vulnerable to changes,"" he said. ""Compared to a lot of environmental problems we've focused on, it's a huge problem.""\ The burning of coal and oil has thickened the layer of greenhouse gases that insulate the earth and trap heat. Global average temperatures have risen about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the last century, and are expected to rise another 4.5 degrees over the next.\ Maryland's climate could grow as balmy as South Carolina's, altering farming and ecosystems in the Chesapeake region. More than 30 species of birds, including the Baltimore oriole, may be forced out of state by the heat, according to a report by Environment Maryland, an advocacy group.\ Warmer temperatures globally are melting glaciers and swelling the oceans. A three-foot rise in sea levels over the next century would devour a football field's width of shore along low-lying areas of the Eastern Shore, and worsen storm-surge flooding in Baltimore and other coastal cities, Kirk-Davidoff said. Warmer waters could spur more intense hurricanes.\ Thirteen islands in the Chesapeake Bay have already been swallowed by rising sea levels, and Maryland loses about 260 more acres of coastal land each year.\ .\ Among the barriers in the way of Maryland cutting its global warming gases is the state's reliance on coal to generate electricity.\ The state is home to nine coal-fired power plants, which make about half of the state's electricity. About 28 percent of the state's electricity comes from nuclear power, 7 percent from oil, 4 percent from natural gas, 3 percent from hydroelectric and 2 percent from other renewable sources.\ In an effort to meet California's goal of a 25 percent reduction in greenhouse gases, Maryland could cut consumption of coal in half. In theory, this power could be supplied instead by 1,240 wind turbines, each almost 400 feet tall. Wind power produces no air pollution.\ But three proposals to build more than 100 turbines in Western Maryland haven't been able to get off the ground, in part because the developers have failed to get agreements with power distribution companies.\ Gregory V. Carmean, executive director of the Maryland Public Service Commission, said replacing coal plants with windmills would be impossible, because wind isn't reliable enough. ""Coal generation is base-load generation, it operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, while wind operates when the wind blows,"" said Carmean. ""Wind doesn't even register on our chart as resource, because it's intermittent.""\ Bethany M. Gill, spokeswoman for the commission, said Maryland's dependence on coal makes it different than California, which has no coal-fired power plants. ""It's not really practical for Maryland,"" she said of California's greenhouse gas law.\ Carbon dioxide from the state's coal-fired plants could perhaps be captured and injected underground, but that's in the experimental phases.\ Maryland could shift from coal to natural gas, which produces less global warming pollution. But this cleaner fuel costs more than three times as much, would send electricity prices higher and require the construction of a new pipeline from the Gulf of Mexico, according to Constellation Energy, the state's biggest power company.\ Maryland could replace some of its coal-fired power plants with nuclear reactors, which emit no greenhouse gases. Constellation is discussing the possibility of adding two more reactors at its quarter-century-old Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant in Southern Maryland. Their extra capacity could, in theory, replace two-thirds of the state's coal-fired plants.\ But nuclear power has its own problems, notably the storage of spent fuel rods. Radioactive waste has been piling up in cement casks at Calvert Cliffs and other power plants, as the federal government has failed to keep a promise to open a central repository in Nevada.\ Mike Tidwell, an author and climate change activist, suggests that conservation alone could allow Maryland to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by more than a quarter by 2020. He noted that Europeans consume about half the electricity, per capita, as Americans.\ Marylanders should drive hybrid cars, insulate their homes, replace their old refrigerators and air conditioners with more efficient ""Energy Star"" models, switch to fluorescent light bulbs and turn off the lights when they're not needed, Tidwell said. The government should offer loans to help people buy more efficient appliances, he said.\ ""Conservation and efficiency gains are the core feasible strategy for solving global warming, no doubt about it,"" Tidwell said.\ But cutting back on power usage would require a reversal of the upward trend in America since World War II, as consumers have demanded ever larger houses and more gadgets. The U.S. Department of Energy predicts electricity consumption will rise by about 20 percent by 2020 - not fall, as activists would like.\ John Quinn, lead engineer for Constellation Energy, said conservation could trim Maryland's increase in electricity consumption from 20 percent to about 10 percent by 2020. But that's a far cry from the 25 percent drop that California envisions.\ ""Everybody has a new iPod and everyone has big-screen TV's and everyone now seems to have external lights on their homes,"" Quinn said. ""I don't know how you stop it. ... ""\ tom.pelton@baltsun.com\ Credit: Sun staff"

I oppose amnesty for those here illegally.\* Corportations/elections: In light of the Citizens' United court ruling, we must update our laws to include common sense safeguards that allow individuals to express their rights without giving corporations, particularly foreign-owned corporations, to unduly in"" uence our elections. In doing so, we must ensure we are not infringing on Americans' First Amendment rights.\* Education: As the father of 5 children, I believe investing in education is the key to our continued prosperity. To improve our schools, we must work together to recruit and retain high quality educators in Maryland. I will continue to advocate for adequate and equitable funding for education as a shared responsibility among local, state and federal government.\* Security: As a member of the Armed Services Committee, our nation's security is one of my top priorities. That's why I've introduced a bill to more severely punish white-collar crimes that finance terrorist activities. I've also fought to honor our veterans' service by ensuring them access to the benefitts they've earned including mental health services.\Andy Harris\* Party: Republican\* Background: B.S., 1977, M.D., 1980, M.H.S., 1995, The Johns Hopkins University. Anesthesiologist. Member, Maryland Senate, 1999 to present. Commander, U.S. Naval Reserve.\* Budget: One of the biggest problems in Washington is the out of control spending. We have to stop spending trillions of dollars on so-called stimulus bills that aren't creating jobs and stop wasting taxpayers' hard-earned money. We need to focus on balancing our budget, not continuing Nancy Pelosi's spending spree.\* Fossil fuels: The United States has enormous energy potential, which is why we need to develop energy independence and low cost energy. We don't need a ""cap and trade"" energy tax that will cost families $1,600 per year.\* Immigration: I recognize the need for legal, temporary workers who don't displace American workers, but we must enforce their return home when their visas expire. Illegal immigration is illegal. Everyone in this country must obey the laws and face consequences if they don't.\* Corportations/elections: We have to take a good hard look at outside groups and their influence on the campaign process in the Unites States. If there's going to be serious campaign finance reform, then spending by unions must also be addressed.\* Education: I believe that funding and decisions regarding education should be kept primarily at the state and local level. The Federal Department of Education has over-expanded its scope and taken resources that could be better utilized if they stayed at the local level.\* Security: The first responsibility of the federal government is to protect and defend the American people. As a Navy veteran, I know that we live in a dangerous world and we must maintain our defenses against our enemies. We must protect our allies and keep their trust by keeping our promises. Peace is kept through strength. I strongly support funding for defense and homeland security programs to ensure that the U.S. has the best-equipped and best-trained military in the world.\Richard James Davis\* Party: Libertarian\* Background: B.S., Allegheny College, 1974. D.D.S., The Ohio State University, 1980. Dentist in private practice, 1982 to present.\* Budget: Require Balanced Budget; Drastic Reductions in Federal Spending including elimination of Federal Departments including Education, Energy, Labor, and Major Parts of Health & Human Services and Housing & Urban Development.\* Fossil fuels: Remove all subsidies from all forms of energy production and allow supply and demand to establish price levels which will ultimately force more efficient use and conservation.\* Immigration: We need a comprehensive, functional guest-worker program so workers who are truly needed can get work visas. Then we need a thorough national discussion to reach some consensus as to how many people our economy and our environment can support. Then we can decide how many, if any, permanent immigrants to accept.\* Corportations/elections: For-Profit Corporations should have no role in elections. Corporate subsidies, tax preferences, and any other preferential or discriminatory treatment by government should be eliminated. Separation of Business and State should be comparable to Separation of Church and State.\* Education: None. Education should be locally controlled as there is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in education. The Federal Department of Education should be abolished.\* Security: 1. Minimize interference in other countries' internal affairs. 2. A reduced, well-trained and equipped career military with greatly enhanced and broadened reserves limited to actual DEFENSE functions. 3. Improved intelligence functions and cooperation. 4. Greatly reduced Presidential power to deploy troops without Congressional Declaration of War.\2nd Congressional District\C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger\* Party: Democrat\* Background: University of Maryland; J.D., University of Baltimore, 1970. Assistant State's Attorney, Baltimore County, 1972 to 1980. Member, Baltimore County Council, 1986 to 1994. Baltimore County Executive, 1994 to 2002. Member, U.S. House of Representatives, 2003 to present.\* Budget: I submitted a balanced budget for eight consecutive years as Baltimore County Executive. I support ""pay-go"" which requires tax cuts or new spending to be funded by cuts to other programs. We must cut waste and ensure government work that can be done in-house is not outsourced.\* Fossil fuels: Domestic renewable energy sources will reduce our dependence on dirty fossil fuels and hostile nations. Funding for research and development as well as tax credits for energy-efficient appliances for homeowners and businesses will help save money and reduce our carbon footprint.\* Immigration: I do not support illegal immigration. In Congress, I introduced legislation to hire 10,000 new border patrol agents. I support the government veri! cation system known as e-Verify, cracking down on companies who knowingly hire illegal workers and deporting felons who are here illegally.\* Corportations/elections: America needsan election system encouraging participation from diverse candidates. I support limited public financing where candidates raise small contributions from their home states, eliminating the role of corporations. Politicians should focus less on raising money and more time helping people.\* Education: The federal government's role is to fund public education and set uniform standards. States and local school districts must have the resources they need to modernize schools, hire and train outstanding teachers and reduce class sizes.\* Security: As a Member of the Intelligence Committee and a representative of the National Security Agency, I believe good intelligence is the best way to prevent terrorism. We must give intel workers the resources they need to keep our country safe from terrorists, cyber hackers, or others trying to harm us.\Marcelo Cardarelli\* Party: Republican\* Background: M.D., Universidad de Buenos Aires, 1980; M.S., The Johns Hopkins University, 2006. Surgeon, University of Maryland Hospital for Children, 1993 to present.\* Budget: A Balanced Budget Amendment. Spending should be sustainable and within the scope of our Constitutional obligations. Revising down our Federal Budget line-by-line to reduce waste, fraud and abuse particularly in the two largest areas of expenditures, healthcare and defense.\* Fossil fuels: In the medium-long term, we need to stimulate the private sector to create the new businesses that will develop the energy technologies of the future. I am personally against subsidies and would rather propose tax incentives for those willing to take the risk of investing in this area.\* Immigration: Secure the borders. Discourage the hiring illegal workers. Befriend pro-market democracies south of the border. Illegal immigration is an economic problem, not a political one.\* Corportations/elections: Corporations are currently banned from giving directly to political campaigns and I support that.\* Education: Having an educated population is probably the best predictor of social stability, economic growth and entrepreneurial development. I believe that it is up to each individual State to partake in the education of its population. I do not see a major role for the federal government in this area.\* Security: America's top security issues are: The war on terrorism, the security of our borders and the existence of terrorism friendly countries with nuclear capabilities (N. Korea, Iran and Pakistan). We must stop using conventional means to fight unconventional wars and we need to prevent the next 9/11.\Lorenzo Gaztanaga\* Party: Libertarian\* Background: Attended University of Baltimore, Towson State University, Loyola College. Security officer, Master Security, 2007 tro present.\* Budget: End wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; close military outposts around the world. End the ""War on Drugs."" Abandon fascistic Homeland Security concept. Stop corporate bail-outs. Reduce salaries and benefits of federal elected officials. These measures will save trillions of dollars.\* Fossil fuels: Eliminate corporate welfare to fossil fuel companies. Fight local regulations restricting solar panels and other renewable energy sources on aesthetic grounds. I do not propose writing laws directing local governments, but I will jawbone for this and look for the leaders who can lead in this regard.\* Immigration: Building a wall on the border is an expensive waste. Stop extracting ""legal"" bribes to expedite applicants' paperwork, and streamline the immigration process. If you can demonstrate that you are gainfully employed and not a criminal threat to the community, you should be legal, period.\* Corportations/elections: Corporations should have no role in elections. All contributions should be from living, breathing individuals only. Would it be perfect? No. Would it be better? Yes. No corporations -- neither GE nor the AFL-CIO, period.\* Education: None. Since the Department of Education was established, the level of instruction has declined. Abolishing the DOE and keeping the money at the local level would save billions. The DOE is a jobs program for people who like to blather and posture and make six figure salaries doing so. Get rid of it.\* Security: Our civil liberties are being eroded in the name of fighting terrorism. Repeal the Patriot Act; stop nation building and trying to restart the cold war. Promote a foreign policy based on free exchange. Becoming an empire killed Rome, and it will kill us, too. For security's sake, stop the wars.\3rd Congressional District\John Sarbanes\* Party: Democrat\* Background: A.B., Princeton University, 1984. J.D., Harvard University, 1988. Attorney. Special Assistant to State Superintendent of Schools, 1998 to 2005. Member, U.S. House of Representatives, 2007 to present.\* Budget: As the economy begins to recover, we must take a serious look at all elements of spending and tax revenue in order to return to fiscal responsibility. Our budget policies should reflect our nation's values- ensuring opportunity, promoting innovation, and sharing the costs of government equitably.\* Fossil fuels: By reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, we can address economic, security, and environmental priorities at once. Just as growth in IT was behind the economic boom of the 1990's, clean energy technology and green jobs will spur growth and offer long-term strength to the American economy.\* Immigration: I support immigration reform that includes improved border security and law enforcement; a focus on punishing employers who knowingly hire illegal workers; and a practical approach to undocumented workers currently in the country. It must improve our security and maintain our national values.\* Corportations/elections: Campaign finance law should strengthen representational government and limit the influence of special interest groups on the electoral and legislative process. It must balance the fundamental right to free speech against the potential for well-funded special interests to exert improper influence.\* Education: I have been active and keenly interested in education policy throughout my professional life, working for the Maryland State Department of Education, and now in the Congress. I strongly support federal education policies that will ensure access to quality education for all Americans.\* Security: I am committed to fighting terrorism and defending our national interests. I support engagement and preventing destructive conflicts. Our defense spending should match what is required to meet clear national security objectives.\Jim Wilhelm\* Party: Republican\* Campaign Website: wilhelmforcongress.com\* Background: U.S. Naval Academy. Managing Partner/Chief Executive Officer, Transitioneering, 2005 to present.\* No response received by League of Women Voters deadline.\Jerry McKinley\* Party: Libertarian\* Background: Manager, Enterprise Product Development and Management, Verizon Wireless, 2004 to 2007, 2010 to present.\* Budget: Federal spending must be curtailed -- much like our own household budgets -- to eliminate deficit spending. I propose to identify efficiencies, eliminate redundancies and cut federal spending wherever possible. Any balanced budget must also include a plan to pay down and eliminate the national debt.\* Fossil fuels: The federal government should encourage reduction of consumption and provide market incentives for renewable and sustainable energy. National legislation could also be passed to streamline the permitting and approval processes for wind turbine & solar panel installations.\* Immigration: As the child of a legal immigrant, Jerry believes that immigrants bring new ideas, consumers and contributors in the marketplace as well as new opportunities. We should welcome legal immigrants and provide a system to encourage people to come here, assimilate and contribute to our society.\* Corportations/elections: Corporations should have the same level of access, ability to contribute financially and influence on elections as any other private citizen provided that their interests are aligned with those of the country and my fellow citizens and they are not provided any benefits by virtue of that role.\* Education: The federal government's role should be limited to encouraging alignment with international standards for education (such as the International Baccalaureate programs). Local authorities should retain the responsibility and accountability to ensure that students are provided a competitive education.\* Security: We must institute austere financial budgets and pay down the debts that we have issued. We need to become self-sufficient as a nation by encouraging companies to deliver products and services citizens desire and show how buying American provides jobs and other long-term benefits to the country.\Alain Lareau\* Party: Constitution\* Background: Electrician.\* No response received by League of Women Voters deadline.\5th Congressional District\Steny H. Hoyer\* Party: Democrat\* Background: B.S., University of Maryland, 1963. J.D., Georgetown University, 1966. President, Maryland Senate, 1975 to 1979; Member, Maryland Senate, 1967 to 1979. Member, U.S. House of Representatives member since 1981.\* Budget: Decreasing the deficit is a top priority and why I supported efforts that address it head on, including reinstating the pay-as-you-go law that helped create surpluses in the 1990s, establishing a bipartisan deficit reduction commission, and increasing scrutiny of how taxpayer money is spent.\* Fossil fuels: Energy independence is vital for our environment, economy and national security. I've been a longtime supporter of bills to help our country improve efficiency, decrease dependence on foreign oil, modernize our electrical grid, develop lower-emitting renewable energy and fuels, and promote development of new nuclear energy at Calvert Cliffs.\* Immigration: Reform should be practical and comprehensive starting with strong border control and enforcement. It must ensure that businesses have enough workers, but hold accountable those that hire illegal workers, and require those here illegally pay a fine, learn English, and get to the back of the line to earn citizenship.\* Corportations/elections: When huge sums of money from unknown sources dominate elections, the interests of ordinary citizens are often the victim. That is why I support the DISCLOSE Act, which takes needed action to ensure transparency and accountability, so Americans know which corporations are funding campaigns and can make better informed decisions.\* Education: I have supported public education because it is critical to creating a stronger workforce and prosperous economy, which is why I recently fought to prevent 140,000 teacher layoffs. Going forward, we must acknowledge our serious fiscal constraints and focus on accountability measures so that investments result in higher academic success.\* Security: We've made significant strides fighting against terrorists, getting real results that make Americans safer. In order to strengthen our security, we must continue working to restore America's global leadership, end torture, work more with allies, and get countries like Pakistan to more fully cooperate in the fight against terrorists.\Charles Lollar\* Party: Republican\* Background: A.A., Emory University, B.S., Kennesaw University, B.S., M.B.A, Regent University. General Manager, Cintas. Major, U.S. Marine Corps.\* Budget: We must reduce spending to affordable levels and not raise taxes. The role of federal government must be restored to do what only government can do like national security, public safety, border protection, and infrastructure. If we cannot first sustain the nation, individuals will not be able to sustain themselves.\* Fossil fuels: First, I would not punish the consumer and the economy with heavy-handed fuel taxes and carbon regulation. I encourage more efficient uses of such fuels such as use of diesel engines and public transportation. I would provide tax incentives for diverse alternatives such as telecommuting, and renewable sources of energy.\* Immigration: We can no longer turn a blind eye to illegal border crossings. We must secure our borders first and understand that amnesty would just encourage such crossings to continue. We must have open trade so economies can grow and people will eventually want to return to their home lands.\* Corportations/elections: The mixing of money and freedom of speech is a continuing challenge. As long as labor unions, political action committees, and other such entities can contribute funds to political causes; corporations must be treated no differently. Key is transparency of funds and their sources.\* Education: The federal role in local education must decline. The role of parents and communities must always be first. Sending scarce tax dollars from our pockets through Washington, never makes them wiser dollars. Federal policy should expand, but not dictate, opportunities for innovation such as vouchers, private and charter schools.\* Security: For vital security, we have no luxury of picking favorites. Our front line is wise diplomacy and a strong economy. We must sustain our deployed forces and provide modernization against future challenges. All rely on assured, effective, and accountable intelligence, in advance of threats, that is second to none.\H. Gavin Shickle\* Party: Libertarian\* Background: Former business owner. U.S military, Iraq.\* Budget: This is one of the key issues of my candidacy. I cannot stress how important it is that our federal government cuts spending in all areas. Right now the interest alone that we owe on our debt is approximately $500 BILLION dollars. We simply cannot continue to operate this way ...\* Fossil fuels: This country should be building more nuclear power plants to supply our daily energy needs. Nuclear energy is clean and reliable and efficient. Also, we should end subsidies for ethanol and stop using ethanol completely. Ethanol is less efficient as a fuel source than gasoline and uses oil at every\* Immigration: I see no need to change any immigration policies at this time.\* Corportations/elections: No response received.\* Education: The federal government should not be involved in education. This is a state and local issue. The federal government cannot possibly know the educational needs of every community. Current federal policy is an unintelligible grab bag of regulations and policies which have accomplished nothing other than to cause states to ...\* Security: First and foremost we need to pay down our debt. We have no security when our government can be held hostage monetarily by corporations and other nations. Secondly, we need to divest from China. We are giving vast sums of money to a government that is not our friend. China's ...\...\6th Congressional District\Andrew Duck\* Party: Democrat\* Background: B.A.A.S., Southwest Texas State University, 1994. Advisor to the Pentagon on Army Intelligence Issues, Office of the Deputy Army Chief of Staff, Northrop Grumman. Captain, U.S. Army, 1982 to 2004. Financial consultant, Merrill Lynch, 1990 to 1991.\* Budget: We must reduce spending and increase revenues. Based on my experience in the Pentagon, I would focus on reforming the Defense Acquisition Process, which is extremely inefficient. I support rolling back the tax cuts for persons earning over $200,000. We can balance our budget; we did it 10 years ago.\* Fossil fuels: We need a portfolio of alternative energy options. I support research to improve options for wind, solar, geothermal, and bio-fuels; and increased conservation. I support geo-thermal heating and cooling for federal buildings. The Sixth District should be a leader in bio-fuels research, as we have the technology and the farmland.\* Immigration: Rather than change the law, we should enforce the existing law. Policies which are not enforced are useless. We should enforce the law which "" nes employers for hiring undocumented workers. Unless we shut off the magnet which is attracting illegal immigrants, we will not be successful dealing with this problem.\* Corportations/elections: None. Special interests already play too large a role in elections. Considering the ""Citizens United"" case, I would restrict corporations from interfering with electoral politics, by changing the law authorizing corporations. Persons have constitutional rights to free speech, but corporations only exist due to legislation, which can be changed.\* Education: Education is vital to maintaining our competitiveness in a global economy. No Child Left Behind has failed. Standardized tests are not a good measure of education. Cutting funding to failing schools will not improve them. I support Individual Education Plans that measure improvement by students, not by school.\* Security: We are engaged primarily in a ""Battle of Ideas"". As a combat veteran, I can tell you that military force should only be used as a last resort. If violence is used against us, we must respond with the appropriate level of force to ensure that any threat is defeated.\Roscoe G. Bartlett\* Party: Republican\* Background: B.A., Columbia Union College, 1947; M.S., 1949, Ph.D., 1952, University of Maryland. Scientist, farmer, teacher, inventor. Member, U.S. House of Representatives, 1993 to present.\* Budget: Long term entitlement reform must be addressed that is why I am a cosponsor (one of 12) of the only bill before Congress that addresses comprehensive entitlement reform, Road Map for America's Future, HR 4529. It provides health and retirement security, lifts the debt burden and promotes job creation.\* Fossil fuels: I advocate policies to support a transition from dependence upon finite fossil fuels, particularly imported oil, to domestic renewable resources. To accomplish this, we need to provide incentives for conservation and energy efficiency and we need to be careful that biofuels do not reduce food supplies.\* Immigration: We all should be proud that America is the most welcoming nation in the world but we need to enforce our existing laws and adequately protect our boarders. I am opposed to amnesty. Also, I am a member of the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus which seeks solutions to illegal immigration.\* Corportations/elections: Corporations should not be treated differently than any other organization, such as a union. I believe that the critical issue is freedom of speech; the Congress should not decide the conditions under which it may be exercised. Corporations like other groups and individuals have campaign contribution limits.\* Education: I believe that the role of the federal government is limited to ensuring that no citizen is barred from the public school systems. However, the decision relating to and the administration of public education should be done on the community level by parents, teachers, local and state government.\* Security: We must reduce our national debt to strengthen our economy and national defense. As already stated, I support the only serious comprehensive entitlement reform bill. As a senior member of the House Armed Services committee, I have proposed and passed programs to maintain our nation's military superiority.\Dan Massey\* Party: Libertarian\* Background: B.S., U.S. Naval Academy, 1994; M.S., U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, 2000. Executive officer, U.S. Navy. Employed by a family business.\* Budget: Flat tax, entitlement reform - privatize Social Security and Medicare, end corporate welfare, make budgets less detailed, less micromanaged. I am a believer in Austrian Economics (see Ludwig von Mises Institute) property rights and less government interference (i.e. smaller budget) in our lives.\* Fossil fuels: The government should stay out of fossil fuels. As fossil fuel becomes hard to get the price will go up and money will flow to other energy forms research and development. Remove all drilling bans as well as all tax credits and supports from the government.\* Immigration: The simple solution to immigration is to remove visa quotas. Allow all that want to come here legally do so. There would be no reason to come here illegally when you can easily get a visa. Hispanics sneak in because there is a 10 year wait for a visa.\* Corportations/elections: I feel that any person or corporation should be allowed to spend what ever they want on any election or candidate but the amount they spend must also be fully disclosed.\* Education: The federal government should stay out of public education. That is the role of the local community. School Principles and School Boards should have more responsibility with money which means more accountability. Charter schools and vouchers are two means of accountability.\* Security: The current military is one of the finest in history. To maintain that cutting edge military we must avoid nation building and less micromanagement of the budget by Congress.\Michael Reed\* Party: Constitution\* Background: B.S., University of Richmond, 1994. J.D., University of Tulsa, 1997. Owner, The Reed Law Firm LLC and Associate Settlements LLC.\* Budget: The printing of money must stop. Bailouts and takeovers of private industries must stop. I would support any efforts to balance the budget, as each responsible citizen of this nation is already doing.\* Fossil fuels: We should first limit our dependence on foreign fossil fuels, by using our abundant fuels here in the United States, including domestic natural gas and coal, in addition to oil.\* Immigration: I support enforcement of immigration laws that are already in place. There is a specific naturalization process that must be followed. I believe Arizona has enacted SB 1070 because, in their view, the federal government had failed to enforce existing immigration laws.\* Corportations/elections: Qualified individuals have the right to vote, not corporations. Corporate interests can conflict with that of individual voters. Also, a corporate entity or union should never coerce an individual from voting.\* Education: The Constitution does not enumerate a role of the federal government to regulate education. It is best left to state and local governments to manage the school systems, as ""one size does not fit all.""\* Security: In the long and short term, we need to make sure that our borders are secure; that our military is well-funded; that they are not stretched across the globe in undeclared wars; and that our military bases here in the U.S. are well-staffed in state of the art facilities.\7th Congressional District\Elijah E. Cummings\* Party: Democrat\* Background: Howard University, 1973; University of Maryland, J.D., 1976. Member, Maryland House of Delegates, 14 years, Speaker Pro Tem. Member, U.S. House of Representatives, 1996 to present.?\* Budget: We should reinstate the more progressive tax structure of the 1990s and remain true to the ""pay-go"" budget discipline re-established by the current Democratic leadership.\* Fossil fuels: Implement the goals of: (1) creating 5 million green jobs (2) conserving 20% of our energy by 2015; (3) freezing pollution levels now, cutting them at least 25% below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80% by 2050; (4) limiting new coal plants; and (5) investing in renewable energy.\* Immigration: I support comprehensive immigration reform to better secure our borders, protect workers against abuse, limit the downward pressure on wages and unify families. We must act both realistically and humanely toward the millions of undocumented workers and their families who currently are within the U.S.\* Corportations/elections: I voted for the successful House passage of the Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections Act [DISCLOSE] Act [H.R. 5175] which seeks to limit corporate spending on elections by requiring disclosure of political advertising funding.\* Education: The federal government should fully fund its education mandates (like ESEA and IDEA), providing the resources that will allow our teachers to properly educate every child. We must adequately educate every child.\* Security: I strongly support the Obama Administration's efforts to stop nuclear proliferation.\Frank Mirabile Jr.\* Party: Republican\* Background: B.S., West Virginia University. Small business owner for 20 years.\* Budget: We must cut government spending, transition out of mandated entitlements and pass policy that will fuel private sector growth, generate personal wealth and promote social independence. The present push for more entitlements creates social dependency beholden to government control. Such policy is detrimental to personal empowerment and burdens economic growth.\* Fossil fuels: The ultimate goal is sustainable energy solutions. I'm against cap and trade and any resultant carbon tax. We must put Americans to work extracting our own natural resources thereby growing our economy to financial solvency and encouraging the private sector to develop clean energy technology without government hindrance or subsidies.\* Immigration: If you enter our country without following our rules of immigration then you are subject to the full extent of our laws. That being said immigration is one of the most valued assets of our nation. Our policies should protect the sanctity of citizenship and promote a nation welcoming many.\* Corportations/elections: If limitations or regulations are put on corporations the same should be applicable to unions, law firms, foundations, etc. (equal application). Full disclosures for all are reasonable. Public sector unions should be banned from any election influences either directly or indirectly. They are indirectly spending private sector tax payer money.\* Education: Control over education should be the responsibility of state and local boards. Local boards should have the ultimate power of policy and decision. Push for more school vouchers and school choice. This will force public schools to enhance their net results bidding for your business. Introduce greater use of technologies.\* Security: National security is the number one job of the federal government.\Scott Spencer\* Party: Libertarian\* No response received by League of Women Voter deadline.\8th Congressional District\Chris Van Hollen\* Party: Democrat\* Background: B.A., Swarthmore College, 1982; M.P.P., Harvard University, 1985; J.D., Georgetown University, 1990. Attorney, Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin & Kahn. Member, House of Representatives, 2003 to present. Member, Maryland Senate, 1995 to 2003. Member, Maryland House of Delegates, 1991 to 1995.\* Budget: Support PAYGO, which forces the federal government to live within its means. Support the House FY11 Budget Enforcement Resolution, which cuts discretionary spending below President Obama's request. Support the Administration's review of the federal budget to identify and eliminate wasteful spending.\* Fossil fuels: Current dependence on fossil fuels harms our environment & national security. We need comprehensive clean energy policy that improves efficiency standards; creates a renewable electricity standard; places a price on carbon; and establishes a federally charted ""Green Bank"" to accelerate clean energy\* Immigration: We must strengthen border security, interior enforcement and prevent illegal immigration. Support comprehensive immigration reform patterned after earlier McCain-Kennedy bill. Fix our legal immigration system to end huge backlogs.\* Corportations/elections: Introduced DISCLOSE ACT to address SCOTUS ruling in Citizens United case which permitted any organization or corporation to spend unlimited money on political advertisements. This legislation will provide unprecedented transparency in America's elections; ensuring corporations cannot mislead voters\* Education: Federal government should encourage school systems to meet high academic standards & provide necessary resources. Pass the first bill I introduced, Keep our Promises to America's Children & Teachers Act which requires the federal government to fully fund NCLB & the federal special education law-IDEA\* Security: Maintain our military strength by making necessary changes proposed by Sec. Gates. Recognize the link between a strong economy and our national security. Increase our international competitiveness and reduce our long-term debt. Lead not only by might of our military, but by power of our ideas.\Michael Lee Philips\* Party: Republican\* Background: B.S., Texas A&M University. Small business owner.\* Budget: Reduce funding for the Arts, non humanitarian Foreign Aid, United Nations, Welfare, Agriculture, discretionary spending freeze, new weapon sys R&D, Fed. spending on education, homeland security, medical & scientific R&D, Dept of Commerce, Transportation, HHS, end bailouts, stimulus, repeal Obamacare\* Fossil fuels: Purchase a minimum of 10% of its energy directly from wind, solar and geothermal energy producers & increase that level by 1% per year until 70% is reached. Another 10% should come from nuclear sources. Conservation programs within the government. Incentives for businesses / homeowners to conserve.\* Immigration: No blanket amnesty. Reduce # of legal immigrants to 250K / year. No driver's licenses or social services for illegal aliens. Support states to reduce illegal immigration. No road to citizenship, but legal status for some. Increase attrition thru enforcement. Enforce the law. Support E-Verify.\* Corportations/elections: No more of a voice than Unions. If Unions have a voice, then corporations should have a voice. If Unions have unlimited rights to spend money to support or defeat candidates, then corporations should have the same rights. If you take the voice away from both, I would favor excluding both.\* Education: None. The feds have failed our kids. This is a state's right. Every state has the means to educate its citizens. The federal government should reduce taxes or proportionately return taxes to each state and allow the states to use those funds to educate its own children in the way they see fit.\* Security: Cyber Security, cargo at ports, security at our border, enforce immigration laws, prepare to stop nuclear attacks from Iran. Reduce the deficit to avoid a financial collapse like the USSR experienced which ended the cold war and left Russia destitute and vulnerable to the theft of nuclear materials.\Mark Grannis\* Party: Libertarian\* Background: Georgetown University; J.D., University of Michigan. Attorney, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP.\* Budget: Our federal government spends too much on things it shouldn't be doing in the first place. We cannot control federal spending by trimming here and there. We must cut government back to constitutional proportions, by privatizing some functions and letting states perform others closer to home.\* Fossil fuels: Government spending to reduce reliance on fossil fuels is completely unnecessary. Plenty of people will pursue so-called green technology without any federal handouts, and when they find viable answers they'll bring them to market and make bundles. We should end these expensive corporate giveaways.\* Immigration: Anyone who wants to work or invest here should be welcome here. If we fix the tax code and eliminate ways to game the welfare-state system, there will be no reason to turn away immigrants with useful skills and clean records. Sound fiscal policy and sound immigration policy agree on this point.\* Corportations/elections: There's no such thing as too much political speech, and all kinds of groups use the corporate form. Regulation of campaign speech by incumbents inevitably favors incumbents over those who want change. Chris Van Hollen's awful DISCLOSE Act illustrates this, and in a nakedly partisan way.\* Education: The nationalization of public education has been a well-intentioned flop, and the flop was of dubious constitutionality to begin with. We should abolish federal education programs and restore state and local authority over public education.\* Security: The best security is to make no enemies and many friends. Free trade, diplomacy, and a strong domestic defense make us safer; military interventions in the affairs of other nations don't. Congress must reassert its authority over war and peace, and sunset existing authorizations of force.\Fred Nordhorn\* Party: Constitution\* Background: Veteran.\* Budget: 1.Support an amended to the constitution that prevents amendments to a bill if it not related to the bill. 2.Make all pork items be put in one bill and let the president have line item veto on that bill only. 3.Stop making government agency buying items they do not want -- like the F22 fighter\* Fossil fuels: We must stop the Drilling Digging, Digging and Drilling with an occasional Mountain Top removing that has been going on for years. manitory recycling, Places like Waste Treatment plants & Oil Refineries should be using the gases they burn off to make electric power. Support the Purple line.\* Immigration: 1. Enforce the law that we have already. 2. Stop stalling on building the Border Fence. 3. Full funding for E-verify & US-VISIT programs. My Grandfather (Father Side) came to this county legally thru Ellis Island. My mother side, some where on the first boats other meet the first boats.\* Corportations/elections: None! Only US Citizen 18 or over should be able to donate to elections. If need amended the constitution with some like this: Only US Citizen 18 or over or who will be 18 at the time of the general election may make donations to elections.\* Education: The No Child Left behind Act, had good intensions, the problem is our teachers now teach a test. We need to relook the Act. We also must stop cutting the Arts, Music and Shop, and enforce the reinstalling of these classes.\* Security: Short-term: Secure our border.\Statewide ballot questions\MD Question 1: Maryland Constitutional Convention\* Should a constitutional convention be called for the purpose of changing the Maryland Constitution?\* Senate Bill 26, Chapter 9 of the 2010 Session - Under Article XIV, Section 2 of the Maryland Constitution the General Assembly is required to ask the voters every 20 years whether a constitutional convention should be called for the purpose of altering the Maryland Constitution.\* Voters will be asked to vote FOR or AGAINST holding a constitutional convention.\* Background: The Maryland Constitution states that it is the duty of the General Assembly to ""provide by law for taking, at the general election to be held in 1970 and every twenty years thereafter, the sense of the people in regard to calling a convention for altering this Constitution. If a majority of voters at such election or elections vote for the convention, the General Assembly must provide by law at its next session for the assembling of, and elections of delegates to, the convention.""\* What happens if this passes? According to our current constitution, if on November 2nd a majority of voters vote for a constitutional convention, at the General Assembly's next session it must pass legislation defining the general structure/organization of the constitutional convention and how the delegates would be elected. It would then be the role of the delegates to draft a new Maryland Constitution to be placed before the voters for adoption or rejection.\* Pros: The present constitution is considerably longer than the average state constitution and nearly twice as long as the United States Constitution and gets more unwieldy as each amendment is proposed and adopted. Some believe that some of the amendments adopted over the years do more than just prescribe the basic framework for the system of government and should be removed. Major improvements to the structure of state government are more likely to be achieved though a constitutional convention than by amendments proposed by legislators who are elected through the political process.\* Cons: There is no particular need for a state constitution to mirror the federal constitution in form or length. A constitutional convention is a long and expensive process and should not be undertaken unless the voters feel the need for a fundamental change in state government. There is no guarantee that the delegates would not be elected by special interest groups and the likelihood that voters will accept, in totality, a new constitution could render the whole process a waste of resources. Amendments proposed by legislators and approved by voters are a more practical way to achieve reform.\MD Question 2: Constitutional Amendment - Trial by Jury\* Authorizing the enactment of legislation to limit the right to a jury trial in a civil proceeding to those proceedings in which the amount in controversy exceeds $15,000. Amending Maryland Declaration of Rights -- Articles 5(a) and 23 - Under Articles 5 and 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, a party in a civil proceeding has a right to a jury trial where the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000. In cases where the amount in controversy does not exceed this threshold amount, a judge, rather than a jury, determines the verdict. The constitutional amendment would increase the amount-in-controversy limitation by providing that a party may not demand a jury trial in a civil proceeding unless the amount in controversy exceeds $15,000, excluding attorney's fees if attorney's fees are recoverable in the proceeding.\* Voters will be asked to vote FOR or AGAINST the Constitutional Amendment.\* Background: Currently civil cases may be heard by the District Court where only a judge presides as long as the amount in dispute does not exceed $30,000. If the plaintiff files the case in the District Court and the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, a defendant may demand a jury trial and the case must be transferred to the Circuit Court. The threshold for the right to demand a jury trial was changed to $5,000 in 1992, and then to $10,000 in 1998. During the 2010 session of the General Assembly, both chambers of the legislature passed Senate Bill 119 by a three-fifths majority. This bill proposed to amend the constitution to say that a defendant in a civil proceeding would not have the right to demand a jury trial unless the amount in controversy is more than $15,000 (excluding attorney?s fees if those fees may be reimbursed as a result of the decision.).\* What happens if this passes? -- If a majority of voters vote for the constitutional amendment, the threshold for demanding a jury trial would increase to $15,000.\* Pros: If this passes, the state could save the time and expense involved in providing a jury trial for civil proceedings where the amount in dispute is between $10,000 and $15,000.\* Cons: Defendants in cases where the amount in controversy is between $10,000 and $15,000, excluding attorney fees, would lose the right to demand a jury hear the case.\MD Question 3: Constitutional Amendment - Baltimore City Judge of the Orphans' Court\* Requires judges of the Orphans' Court in Baltimore City to be members in good standing of the Maryland Bar who are admitted to practice law in Maryland. Under the Maryland Constitution, the voters of each county and Baltimore City elect three judges to the Orphans'Court of their respective jurisdictions, with the exception of Montgomery and Harford counties, where circuit court judges sit as the Orphans? Court. The judges must be citizens of the State and residents, for the preceding 12 months, in the city or county in which they are elected. The constitutional amendment would add an additional eligibility requirement for judges of the Orphans' Court in Baltimore City, requiring them to be members in good standing of the Maryland Bar who are admitted to practice law in Maryland.\* Voters will be asked to vote FOR or AGAINST this constitutional amendment.\* Background: Orphans' Court judges hear all contested matters regarding a decedent's estate, including validity of wills and legal questions involving transfers of property. The Orphans' Court also supervises estates that are probated judicially; approves accounts, awards of personal representatives' commissions, and attorneys fees in all estates; and has concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts in the guardianship of minors and their property. Although many Orpan's Court judges are attorneys, they are not required to be lawyers or members of the state bar.\* What happens if this passes? If a majority of voters statewide, as well as a majority of voters in Baltimore City, vote for this Constitutional amendment, the additional requirement of being in good standing in the Maryland Bar and admitted to practice law in Maryland will be applied to all Orphans' Court Judges in Baltimore City.\Baltimore County Executive\Kevin Kamenetz\* Age: 52\* Occupation: General practice lawyer, four-term member of Baltimore County Council\* Residence: Owings Mills\* Education: The Johns Hopkins University, University of Maryland School of Law\* Experience: Former Baltimore City assistant state's attorney\On issues:\* Fiscal management: Argues that current fiscal management has served the county well. Points out that this year's budget is 4.4 percent below last year's, and that he has been part of the admininstration that voted to cut the tax rate twice in the last eight years without cutting services or forcing county employee layoffs or furloughs.\* Public safety: Supports innovative approaches to law enforcement, including more use of broadband communications in patrol cars. Introduced the law that requires security cameras in parking lots of large county shopping center, a move that has been credited with helping to reduce crime.\* Economic development: Recently advocated development of an office and restaurant part in Randallstown, and argues that he has supported economic development efforts that have helped more than 30 companies expand, relocate or open in the county this year alone.\Kenneth C. Holt\* Age: 59\* Occupation: Senior vice president, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney; runs small family beef cattle business\* Residence: Kingsville\* Eduation: University of Maryland, College Park\* Experience: Former one-term member, Maryland House of Delegates; formerly ran international competitive horse auction business\On issues:\* Fiscal management: Argues that the county can save between 3 and 8 percent in costs through a range of efficiencies in department operations, money that would help cushion the blow of potential new expenses likely to be imposed in teacher pension costs now covered by the state.\* Public safety: Argues for law enforcement enhanced with broadband wireless technology and more effort on cyber security. Would use technology to track violent offenders and see federal money for Homeland Security and DNA data.\* Economic development: Proposes platform including expansion of the county's economic development efforts with a larger department, more ""enterprise zones"" to direct aid to distressed areas and specific business sites, such as the Solo Cup plant in Owings Mills. Supports using existing rail lines to establish transit links between Baltimore Crossroads on the east side and Randallstown on the west."
78,"Capital News Service\ANNAPOLIS ---- A team of progressive advocacy groups convened at Annapolis' City Dock Wednesday to urge Maryland congressmen and specifically Rep. Frank Kratovil, D-Md., to pass President Obama's $3 trillion-plus budget.\Advocates said they are targeting Kratovil because the newcomer to the delegation is a ""Blue-dog"" Democrat known for challenging the president's initiatives.\The event kicked-off the Maryland leg of the national Rebuild and Renew America Now campaign aimed at quashing markups on and garnering federal support for the president's controversial 2010 budget, which faces heavy scrutiny on Capitol Hill this week over its record federal deficit.\Representatives from Environment Maryland, Maryland Public Interest Research Group, ACORN, Progressive Maryland and the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, among others, took turns at a makeshift podium ---- a trash can covered with a blanket and outfitted with a microphone ---- to say they were more concerned with government inaction than increasing the national debt.\""Our position is that at a time of national crisis we need to listen to our top economists who have all said we face a greater threat if the federal government doesn't act in an aggressive and effective way,"" said Matthew Weinstein, federal issues director of Progressive Maryland and Maryland coordinator for Health Care for America Now.\Weinstein and others touted the president's proposed budget as the ""blueprint"" for policies to make college affordable, reform an ""embarrassing"" health care system and improve the environment by funding clean energy and establishing a strict cap-and-trade policy for carbon emissions.\According to an analysis of the budget released Wednesday by Rebuild and Renew America Now, taxpayers would save $730 million by the proposed elimination of oil and gas subsidies; $928 million could flow into state accounts if emissions permits were capped and auctioned; 230 residents could secure their imperiled health insurance with the planned reforms; 2.1 million residents' taxes would drop under the Make Work Pay Tax Credit; Pell Grant reform and expansion could lower the average debt of Maryland college students; and the average family would save $453 if new tax proposals were adopted.\But inflating the national debt to finance the proposals, may not be the best route forward, critics charge.\Kratovil's short voting history ---- he took office in January ---- make the activists fret he will oppose the bill alongside Republicans, as he did for the omnibus budget bill and the first economic stimulus package before it was renegotiated in the Senate."
79,"OCEAN CITY -- Most candidates in the 2008 election put away their campaign posters and fliers shortly after the Nov. 4 contest. But not Andy Harris.\The three-term Republican Maryland State Senator only narrowly lost the race for Maryland's First District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives to Democrat Frank Kratovil and in his concession, promised a rematch in 2010.\""I've been at it for three years now,"" Harris said during a recent stop on his campaign. ""We came close two years ago ... campaigning is all about meeting people and they get to talk with you, you talk with them you hear their concerns and what they have to say. People are becoming much more comfortable with the idea of sending someone with my background to Washington.""\Harris, a Harford County resident, is an anesthesiologist and served 17 years in the U.S. Naval Reserves. In the 2008 election, he lost to Kratovil by less than 3,000 votes. In Worcester County, where 57 percent of voters were in favor of Republican Presidential nominee John McCain, only 44.7 percent cast ballots for Harris.\Kratovil, the former Queen Anne's County state's attorney, benefited from being an Eastern Shore resident, said Adam Hoffman, a professor of political science at Salisbury University and director of the Instate for Public Affairs and Civic Engagement.\""Eastern Shore voters are a very localized group with hometown, parochial concerns,"" Hoffman said. ""To be viewed as an outsider, someone from the other side of the bridge, is not good for candidates.""\In the last election, Harris seemed to focus a lot of his attention on the larger counties in the district on the other side of the Chesapeake Bay, Hoffman added, counting on the large population centers to carry the vote.\However, since then, the candidate has increased his ties to the Eastern Shore, in particular through working at Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Salisbury and Memorial Hospital in Easton. There, Harris said, he got to know people both in medicine and the community and took time to listen to their needs. He was particularly struck by the impact of the death of Dr. Jose Alvarado, a popular Salisbury area physician, who was killed in a car accident on Route 50 while Harris was at PRMC.\""That was worrisome to the community because it was very difficult to recruit a pediatrician to the area the last time they needed one, and they felt it was going to take a long time to get that medical care replaced,"" he said. ""That's something that once you move outside metropolitan areas, that's a concern.""\Spending time at PRMC was a good move for Harris, Hoffman said.\""Anything a candidate can do to increase their ties is an improvement,"" he added.\Harris may have an easier time this year because of the anti-incumbent sentiment, however, he will need to watch when he follows party lines and when he doesn't, Hoffman said.\For example, Harris said the he would have opposed the cap and trade energy bill -- which Kratovil voted for -- because it would have hurt poultry farmers on the Lower Shore.\""We have to recognize that if that industry is allowed to slip -- not even fall, just slip -- then the unemployment situation (on the Shore), which is already the worst unemployment picture in the state of Maryland, would just become a devastating picture,"" he said.\However, Kratovil said that he supported the bill because of its protections of the industry.\""I voted for a common sense energy bill that focused on creating green energy jobs here at home while reducing our dependence on foreign oil,"" the congressman said. ""Because I was able to work with colleagues on the Agriculture Committee, we ensured that Maryland farmers would be completely exempted from the new emissions caps, while adding an amendment to the bill that will make Maryland farmers eligible for more than $1 billion in new market-based revenues.""\Harris may want to be careful on environmental issues, Hoffman said, which tend to be particularly important among area residents.\""The environment is sort of the one issues that conservative voters on the Eastern Shore do not come down traditionally conservative for,"" he said.

80,"It doesn't take a world-class bargain-hunter to recognize that the price of anything, from groceries to electronics, is impossible to assess without considering hidden costs. Like that big-screen TV? Better ask about the added cost of cables and digital sound. A home listed below market price can seem great - until repairs to the cracked foundation, faulty wiring and leaky plumbing are factored in.\Yet for decades, the U.S. has embraced an energy policy blithely ignorant of the true price tag of driving our highways and providing electricity to our homes. That was underscored this week with the release of a new study that finds burning fossil fuels is costing the U.S. $120 billion a year in health care costs.\That's an enormous but largely ignored sum of money. Americans are far more likely to scream over paying pennies more at the pump or on their utility bills than to bother to notice the much greater cost associated with the thousands of premature deaths and serious illnesses tied to pollution from coal and oil.\What's particularly stunning about the study, conducted by the National Research Council and released Monday by the National Academy of Sciences, is that the $120 billion does not include the costs of climate change (or many other costs that can be linked to pollution). Factoring in such long-term threats as coastal flooding from rising sea levels, loss of farmland or the threat posed to national security could make the health care price tag seem like small potatoes.\Coal-fired power plants are a particularly troublesome factor in these calculations because they discharge so much pollution into the atmosphere. How can renewable alternatives compete when their greatest assets - their lack of hidden costs - aren't factored into the equation?\The findings also remind us just how misguided it is to think that current federal and state gas taxes cover the cost of driving. The tax may build highways and bridges (however inadequately), but it ignores the damage done to the air we breathe or the atmospheric changes wrought by greenhouse gases.\Nearly 20,000 people die prematurely each year because of the hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and particulates that pour out of all those tailpipes and smokestacks. We subsidize the true cost of all that pollution with our lives. Have we no value?\What would it take to put fossil fuels on an even playing field with less-polluting forms of energy? For starters, some experts suggest, gasoline and diesel prices would probably have to increase at least 23 to 38 cents per gallon just to cover the environmental damage.\Cap-and-trade provisions in the climate change legislation pending in Congress would no doubt help the nation transition away from coal or at least take measures to reduce its impact. But unless the Senate embraces the bipartisan compromise recently touted by Sens. John Kerry and Lindsey Graham, the odds of that happening this year seem quite slim.\Continuing to ignore all the hidden costs associated with our carbon-fueled economy is like living on credit cards with outrageously high interest rates. We can either pay a little bit now or a whole lot later on. Any rational consumer would choose to settle the bill as soon as possible.\Readers respond\We are dolts if we don't realize that we pay the price for our environmental apathy with debilitating ailments like emphysema, asthma, coronary artery disease and cancer. Take note of what the environment is doing to the toads, the salamanders, the birds and the fish in the sea; pretty soon the environment will do the same to thee.\Caravan\$120 billion in escalated health care costs? I think it's time we stop the fear tactics by the green propagandists to get their way by any means necessary.\Carlhk1"
81,"A consortium of Northeastern states including Maryland has agreed to reset a power plant emissions cap to current levels and to tighten it annually starting in 2015, an action officials said would increase investment in energy efficiency and slightly raise electricity prices, besides cutting pollution.\The change amounts to a 45 percent reduction in the cap's ceiling, which has far exceeded actual pollution levels because of improved energy efficiency, increased renewable power generation, mild weather and the slumping economy. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative announced Thursday that its nine member states had agreed to the cut, with input from other stakeholders. \Environmental advocates and business leaders both welcomed the revision, saying it would strengthen efforts to address climate change and reward investment in clean energy. Some said the first-in-the-nation cap-and-trade initiative, known by its acronym RGGI, could also prompt more action to cut carbon emissions on a national level, as President Barack Obama has vowed to make climate change a top priority of his second term. \""They're locking in the reductions that have taken place to date and ensuring that RGGI will continue to drive reductions in pollution going forward,"" said Peter Shattuck, director of market initiatives for Environment Northeast, a Maine-based advocacy group. ""It's noteworthy especially now as Obama has been re-elected, and in the wake of [Hurricane] Sandy, for RGGI states to get out and lead on this. They are helping cause the pendulum to swing back on climate."" \The initiative launched in 2008, requiring power plants to buy carbon dioxide emissions allowances `in regular auctions. The initial cap was set so loose that it allowed plants to buy allowances at low prices and save them for future needs. Over the past few years, allowance auction prices have declined along with emissions levels and electricity prices. \The new cap reduces the 2014 emissions cap from 165 million tons of carbon dioxide to 91 million tons -- about what was expected to be the emissions total for 2012. The cap would then decline by 2.5 percent each year from 2015 to 2020. \The Maryland Department of the Environment will now set out to revise regulations for power plant operators around the state, to reflect the new cap, said Kathy M. Kinsey, deputy secretary of the agency. \A spokesman for Exelon Corp., which owns Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. and a handful of power plants in the Baltimore area, said in a statement the company ""supports market-based approaches to addressing climate change, as well as the effort to maintain and improve the RGGI program."" \Other business groups, with members including companies like Timberland, Ben & Jerry's and eBay, welcomed the new cap. \Some criticized it, however. The New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity called the new cap ""a massive tax hike"" on electricity bills. New Jersey was an original member of the regional initiative but left in 2011 as Republican Gov. Chris Christie called it a ""failure"" that would not reduce greenhouse gases. \Auction prices power plant operators pay could rise if demand for the allowances reverses course and increases, which could mean higher electricity prices. Models that initiative organizers used in reaching their agreement showed an average monthly bill effect below 1 percent, a figure that includes the benefit of investment of auction proceeds into energy-efficiency programs, according to state environmental officials. \sdance@baltsun.com \twitter.com/ssdance\Credit: The Baltimore Sun"

83,"Maryland earned nearly $16.4 million last week in the nation's first mandatory auction of rights for power plants to release climate-changing pollution, state officials reported yesterday. Most of the proceeds will go toward promoting energy efficiency among the state's electricity consumers and for providing some relief from soaring power bills.\""It couldn't have gone any better,"" Shari T. Wilson, state secretary of the environment, said of Thursday's auction of allowances permitting power plants to emit carbon dioxide. The auction results were ""basically on the money with the estimates we had been relying on,"" she said.\In all, more than $38.5 million was raised by the auction of 12.5 million tons' worth of carbon dioxide allowances from Maryland and other states participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The other states were Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont. Maryland had put up the largest share of allowances for auction. Each allowance permits the holder to release 1 ton of carbon dioxide into the air.\A buildup of carbon dioxide, largely from burning fossil fuels, is the leading cause of warming global temperatures, climate scientists have said. Maryland and nine other states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic have banded together to use market pressures to cap and then reduce previously unregulated emissions of the gas from power plants. States in the West and Midwest are considering similar regional efforts, while Congress weighs national legislation.\Under the ""cap and trade"" system, states limit the amount of the gas that can be emitted by power plants within their borders. Each utility must acquire enough allowances to cover its plants' emissions, either through the auction or by purchasing them from other winning bidders afterward. The cost of paying to pollute is expected to drive utilities to reduce their emissions, or take other steps to reduce carbon dioxide, such as planting trees. The regional initiative involving Maryland aims for a 10 percent reduction in emissions by 2020.\Officials coordinating the regional effort have predicted that the new system could increase electric bills by $1 or so per month, but Maryland officials have suggested consumers' bills could decrease as a result of efficiency efforts.\Some had worried that prices bid may be either too low to compel a change in the way power plants operate, or too high, causing a spike in consumers' electric bills. Supporters said the bidding results announced yesterday suggest smooth running for the five other auctions planned through the end of 2009.\""The scare-mongers who were predicting that speculators would push prices out of control have been proven wrong,"" said Brad Heavner, director of Environment Maryland.\Officials declined to identify the purchasers, saying disclosure of winning bidders could skew subsequent trading. There were 59 bidders in all, officials said, representing energy, financial and environmental interests.\Under state law approved this year, nearly half of the proceeds of Maryland's auction will be used to underwrite state programs promoting energy efficiency. Nearly a quarter will go to rate relief for consumers, with an additional 17 percent earmarked to provide free energy assistance to low-income utility customers. The remainder will be spent on public education, environmental regulation and oversight of the effort.\Credit: tim.wheeler@baltsun.com"

The decision about which presidential candidate deserves your vote in the November election is an especially important one with numerous factors to consider. For those of us in the Mid-Atlantic region who value clean rivers and streams and want to preserve our quality of life, the decision to vote for Sen. Barack Obama is an easy one to make. Mr. Obamas platform, unlike John McCains, recognizes the unique nature of the Chesapeake watershed, and he is dedicated to providing the resources to clean up the water flowing into the bay. The Obama Democratic platform states, We support a comprehensive solution for restoring our national treasures such as the Great Lakes, Everglades and Chesapeake Bay including expanded scientific research and protections for species and habitats there. The Obama platform also promises to change direction from the previous eight years and strengthen the enforcement of existing environmental laws. It says: We will reinvigorate the Environmental Protection Agency so that we can work with communities to reduce air and water pollution and protect our children from environmental toxins, and never sacrifice science to politics. More specifically, Mr. Obama supports numerous initiatives that will reduce nutrient and sediment pollution from the three sectors that most affect local water quality and the health of the Chesapeake region: wastewater treatment plant upgrades, agriculture and land use change and development. Mr. Obama has been a strong leader on clean water issues and recognizes the importance of wastewater treatment plant upgrades. However, he knows that these upgrades can be expensive investments for local and state governments. An Obama administration will help communities meet their clean water needs by restoring federal financing for water treatment infrastructure through full funding of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. As president, Mr. Obama will work to improve incentives that help farmers prevent runoff pollution from soil erosion, fertilizers and pesticides. This will include increased funding in his budget for the U.S. Department of Agricultures Conservation Security Program and Conservation Reserve Program. Mr. Obama has demonstrated his commitment to agriculture and the environment by his endorsement of the 2008 Farm Bill. This bill included $188 million for the new Chesapeake Bay Watershed Program, which targets innovative conservation practices in the Susquehanna, Potomac, Shenandoah and Patuxent watersheds, as well as an additional $252 million from other conservation programs for the Chesapeake states. Over the years, Mr. Obama has worked for tougher environmental regulations on concentrated animal feeding operations, including limits on nitrogen, phosphorous, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and other pollutants. Land use change and development in rural areas is the single most significant threat to the long-term quality of life and environmental health in the Chesapeake region. Mr. Obama recognizes that nonpoint pollution is the largest source of water pollution into our rivers and streams, which is his reason for proposing a new stormwater cleanup program. In addition, an Obama administration will re-evaluate the transportation funding process to ensure that smart growth considerations are taken into account and will recommit federal resources to public mass transportation projects across the country. Forests and wetlands are two of the most important land uses in the Chesapeake region that need to be preserved to improve the quality of our rivers and streams. To foster healthier forestlands, Mr. Obama proposes offering incentives to maintain forests and manage them sustainably, including rewarding forest owners and farmers when they plant trees. Over the years, he has been an advocate for preserving our wetlands by strongly supporting the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and the Wetlands Reserve Program. Mr. Obama is proposing to invest $150 billion nationwide over the next decade to develop solar, wind and ethanol technologies. He will create a $50 billion Clean Technologies Venture Capital Fund that will move cellulosic technologies from the laboratory to commercialization. This effort will encourage cellulosic ethanol production in the Chesapeake states. This broad investment in energy technologies will generate 5 million new jobs in our nation in both rural and urban areas and provide greater energy security and cleaner water. Mr. Obamas climate change initiative reduces carbon emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050, employs a cap-and-trade system and is more comprehensive than John McCains because it auctions 100 percent of pollution credits. In summary, Mr. Obama will bring the change we need a stronger economy, more jobs, energy security and a cleaner, healthier Chesapeake region. David Bancroft is an energy and environment advisor to the Obama-Biden campaign. Distributed by Bay Journal News Service.

This bill included $188 million for the new Chesapeake Bay Watershed Program, which targets innovative conservation practices in the Susquehanna, Potomac, Shenandoah and Patuxent watersheds, as well as an additional $252 million from other conservation programs for the Chesapeake states.\Mr. Obama has worked for tougher environmental regulations on concentrated animal feeding operations, including limits on nitrogen, phosphorus, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and other pollutants.\Land-use change and development in rural areas is the single most significant threat to the long-term quality of life and environmental health in the Chesapeake region. Mr. Obama recognizes that non-point pollution is the largest source of water pollution into our rivers and streams, which is his reason for proposing a new stormwater cleanup program. In addition, an Obama administration would re-evaluate the transportation funding process to ensure that Smart Growth considerations are taken into account and would recommit federal resources to public mass transportation projects across the country.\Forests and wetlands are two of the most important land uses in the Chesapeake region that need to be preserved to improve the quality of our rivers and streams. To foster healthier forests, Mr. Obama proposes offering incentives to maintain and manage them sustainably, including rewarding forest owners and farmers when they plant trees. Over the years, he has been an advocate for preserving our wetlands by supporting the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and the Wetlands Reserve Program.\Mr. Obama is proposing to invest $150 billion nationwide over the next decade to develop solar, wind and ethanol technologies. He would create a $50 billion Clean Technologies Venture Capital Fund that would move cellulosic technologies from the laboratory to commercialization. This effort would encourage cellulosic ethanol production in the Chesapeake states. This broad investment in energy technologies would generate 5 million jobs in our nation and provide greater energy security and cleaner water.\Mr. Obama's climate change initiative reduces carbon emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, employs a cap-and-trade system and auctions 100 percent of pollution credits.\In summary, Mr. Obama would bring the change we need: a stronger economy, more jobs, energy security and a cleaner, healthier Chesapeake region.\David Bancroft is an energy and environment adviser to the Obama-Biden campaign."
86,"The O'Malley administration plans to move forward with efforts to combat global warming, despite the legislature's rejection of a high-profile bill that would have curbed Maryland's greenhouse gas emissions, officials said yesterday.\Secretary of the Environment Shari T. Wilson said that even without the bill mandating a 25 percent emissions reduction by 2020, Gov. Martin O'Malley secured enough of his energy policy priorities during the legislative session that ended Monday to make progress on climate change.\""We didn't get the umbrella, but we got the pieces of the engine to move forward,"" Wilson said. ""All in all, we're in pretty good shape.""\Lawmakers passed all five of the O'Malley administration's energy bills, including an ambitious plan for reducing energy use 15 percent by 2015, plus a doubling of renewable power, such as wind and solar, to be generated in the state by 2022.\Environmentalists, though disappointed by the failure of the Global Warming Solutions Act in the final hours of the 90-day legislative session, took heart in the energy legislation, which they say should advance the cause significantly.\""I think that the climate on balance was a really big winner during the 2008 Maryland session,"" said Mike Tidwell, director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network. ""The fact that the renewable electricity standard was doubled to 20 percent is by itself astonishing.""\Environmentalists spent three years lobbying lawmakers to approve an initial goal of 7.5 percent from renewable energy sources, he said.\The global warming bill failed after a strong push by labor unions and industry and despite efforts by proponents, including the O'Malley administration, to mollify their objections. Members of the United Steelworkers, who represent 5,000 employees of steel, brick, cement, chemical and paper plants statewide, were a nearly constant presence in Annapolis at hearings and in the galleries to demonstrate their concern that pollution reductions required by the warming bill could cost them their jobs.\The bill's original long-range requirement of reducing greenhouse gases by 90 percent by 2050 - heralded by environmentalists as one of the most ambitious proposals in the nation - was downgraded to a goal. The bill passed the Senate, but with an amendment sought by manufacturers and unions that would require state environmental officials to get legislative approval of their plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\Opponents then bottled up the bill in House committees until the final hours of the session.\Wilson said that over the weekend, administration officials had offered to include language in the bill saying that her department would not take any steps that might reduce employment at the state's manufacturing facilities.\But she said that on Monday it became apparent that that assurance wouldn't be enough for some union representatives and industry lobbyists.\""I think the problem was that obviously there were a large number of us, including most prominently labor, who were very concerned about the potential impacts of what was, after all, one of the most far-reaching pieces of legislation the General Assembly has ever considered,"" said Michael C. Powell, a lobbyist for the Maryland Industrial and Technology Alliance, a group of manufacturers.\With a batch of amendments being offered by proponents and opponents alike and the session ticking to a close, members of the House Economic Matters Committee opted to let the bill die.\""I think we just ran out of time,"" said Del. Brian J. Feldman, a Montgomery County Democrat who was a co-sponsor of the bill. Mindful of the backlash to the legislature's 1999 decision to deregulate electric generation, lawmakers feared making last-minute decisions on a complex measure that might have unintended consequences, he said.\Tidwell and other environmentalists said they believe workers anxious about their jobs were misled by industry lobbyists. But Powell, the industrial and technology alliance lobbyist, said he would be happy to work with advocates over the next year in crafting a plan to deal with global warming.\So did Jim Strong, representative of the United Steelworkers.\""I don't look at it as a failure,"" Strong said of the bill. ""I look at it as a failure to communicate with stakeholders.""\He said his union is committed to addressing global warming but was concerned about state actions that might hinder Maryland industry's ability to compete.\But Tidwell, the climate activist, said Congress and the federal government tend to follow the lead of state governments on issues such as this one.\The state already is moving to regulate carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas. Earlier this year, the Maryland Department of the Environment proposed a cap-and-trade system that would set a ceiling next year on carbon-dioxide emissions from coal-, oil- and natural gas-fired power plants, with a 10 percent reduction required by 2019.\Those rules stem from Maryland's move last year to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - a cooperative effort of 10 northeastern and mid-Atlantic states to fight global warming.\Under the initiative, carbon dioxide emission ""allowances"" are to be auctioned off later this year for power plants. State officials project the auction could yield $80 million to $140 million a year, most of which will be used for conservation and greenhouse gas reduction programs.\tim.wheeler@baltsun.com\Sun reporters Gadi Dechter and Bradley Olson contributed to this article.\Credit: Sun reporter"

Education
\
The Maryland State Department of Education is about to approve language to institute an environmental literacy graduation requirement for all Maryland students.
\
I applaud MSDE's efforts to bring environmental literacy to our students, but the proposed language creates a hole in the environmental literacy graduation requirement. The language uses only the science and social studies curriculum as the mechanisms to meet the new standards.
\
I would argue that environmental education is about more than science and social studies.
\
Broadneck High School is developing an Environmental Literacy Signature program where students are learning about the environment in many other content areas, besides science and social studies. Some examples include: technology classes - wind turbines, alternative energy, solar cars, etc.; business classes - environmental law and conservation science in the age of technology; child development classes - how to teach about the environment; art classes - endangered species; and Spanish classes - environmental camp and translation of nature trail brochure.
\
An interdisciplinary approach to environmental literacy can be done and done successfully without overtaxing our budgets or our educational system. Broadneck is proving that.
\
I urge MSDE to approve the alternative language below. This will allow Anne Arundel County Public Schools to create a program where our students can receive a well-rounded environmental education that will serve them in an increasingly complex environmental world after they graduate.
\
Beginning with students entering high school in 2011-2012, all students must complete a locally designed high school program of environmental literacy as set forth in COMAR 13A.04.17 that is approved by the State Board of Education.
\
Please send letters supporting this alternative language to Mary Thurlow, MSDE, at mthurlow@msde.state.md.us no later than Feb. 3.
\
Today's students are tomorrow's environmental stewards. Let's equip them with the best tools we have to offer.

Carbon-based fuels
\
I would like to weigh in with some facts about our use of carbon-based fuels, the Earth's climate and the desires of man.
\
Fact: ""Massive"" is a relative term, as in ""humans are pumping massive amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere."" I had a massive kidney stone once. It was the size of an aircraft carrier.
\
Fact: CO2 accounts for .039 percent of the earth's atmosphere.
\
Fact: The sun's temperature fluctuates, which effects changes to the temperature on Earth and the other planets.
\
Fact: There are people on this Earth who seek the power to limit the energy usage of each business and each individual. When you've used all your carbon credits you'll have to purchase more from an imaginary commodities market.
\
Opinion: You won't be able to afford it.
\
Fact: There are people on this Earth who think they know what's best for you and they seek the power to implement policies that dictate your everyday activities.
\
These people are not the alpha leaders. They're the weasels. And the people that support them convince themselves of some guilt complex or whatever. They resent prosperity and resent the enjoyment others get out of life.
\
If someone believes anthropological global warming is a serious threat then they have to believe a compulsory cap and trade system must be implemented. They have to believe carbon- based fuels must arbitrarily be made more expensive through taxation and regulation. They have to be OK with forcing people into a lower standard of living. No one will go voluntarily.
\
Even if humans are causing the Earth to warm, which they aren't, I still fear the government and the busybodies more than a few degrees and some smog.
\
I'd rather choke on the noxious fumes of liberty than breathe the pure, sweet air of tyrany.

Health care
\
Have you stopped to consider what health care reform is actually going to mean to you?
\
Doctors ultimately face imprisonment if they do not give your medical records to the government. A panel will look at those records and decide what medical care you will be allowed to receive.
\
So, while those of us with pre-existing conditions may be rejoicing that the government will force somebody to sell us health insurance, we should realize that having insurance is not the same thing as receiving treatment. The committee will decide whether we are worth the cost of treatment, what the treatment will be and when we can receive it.
\
I am astonished that a nation that once decried government in our bedrooms, that rallied around the premise that a woman's body was her own and her medical treatment was between her and her doctor, that believed that whether one is HIV positive is a matter of absolute privacy, is now content with the government keeping all of our medical records and taking absolute control of what medical treatment we are allowed to receive.
\
I say, stop this invasion of privacy at the source. Demand that our doctors keep our medical records private.

Annapolis
"
88,"
Walk along the beach, drive over the Bay Bridge or peer out from a boat, and the Chesapeake Bay often looks lovely.
\
Sunlight glistens on the surface as the gentle waves roll by. As the weather warms, more boats will dot the bay, with sailors seeking the thrill of harnessing the wind and anglers searching for a trophy rockfish.
\
But below the surface, the nation's largest estuary is in deep trouble.
\
Nutrient and sediment pollution choke oxygen from the water, leading to vast ""dead zones"" where fish, crabs and oysters can't survive.
\
Sprawling suburban developments gobble up forests and wetlands in favor of roadways, lawns and homes. Some people even get sick from swimming in the bay's creeks and rivers.
\
""The condition of the bay is not good and people are becoming attuned to that,"" said Kim Coble, who heads up the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay Foundation's efforts in Maryland.
\
For decades now, government officials and environmental activists have attempted to restore the Chesapeake Bay's water quality to healthy levels.
\
But the road to restoration is littered with broken promises and failed efforts. Official cleanup agreements were signed with much fanfare in 1983, 1987 and 2000; laws have been passed; special taxes have been levied - yet the bay's health has remained unacceptably poor.
\
In recent months, there's been a renewed effort to clean up the bay, including significant attention from the federal government.
\
Some involved in bay cleanup said they think this could be a fresh start for the bay. Others see more of the same failures.
\
""Everyone's talking like this time is going to be different,"" said Chris Trumbauer, a biologist who patrols the West and Rhode rivers as a riverkeeper. ""We'll see.""
\
The Chesapeake Bay, it seems, is at a crossroads. Is there any hope left?
\
What's wrong
\
Most of the Chesapeake's troubles can be traced back to one simple fact: There's been an exponential growth of people living on the land that drains into the bay.
\
Whether it's through farming, fishing, fertilizing the lawn, driving cars, building new homes and businesses, using ""dirty"" electricity, failing to pick up pet waste or just plain flushing the toilet, the 17 million people who live in the bay's six-state, 64,000-square-mile watershed send huge amounts of nutrient and sediment pollution flowing into the Chesapeake each year.
\
All of those nutrients and all of that sediment spur algae growth, cloud the water, choke out oxygen and make it impossible for aquatic wildlife to survive.
\
As such, the bay has declining populations of blue crabs, oysters and many fish. Wetlands and forests are threatened and sea-level rise could swamp the shorelines. There's constant pressure for development, especially along the water. Beaches are periodically closed due to high bacteria levels in the water and swimmers are being sickened by pathogens and scary skin infections.
\
Those problems mean the Chesapeake Bay does not even come close to meeting the requirement of the federal Clean Water Act for ""fishable and swimmable"" waters.
\
In fact, the bay is so unhealthy that it is on the Clean Water Act's list of the nation's ""impaired waters.""
\
""In my lifetime - I'm 35 - I've seen the water quality get worse,"" said Trumbauer, the West-Rhode Riverkeeper. ""I've physically seen it. There are stories like mine all over the state. The bay is such a part of Maryland. We have a right to see it's restored to a functional, healthy ecosystem. Is that possible? It is. It's going to be hard, but I'm not going to give up yet.""
\
'Three-legged' stool
\
Fingers have been pointed in almost every direction, looking for a surefire explanation for why restoration has largely been a failure.
\
Some of the accusations: elected officials don't have political will to pass tough pollution laws, people don't want to pay more money or sacrifice to clean the bay, the federal government hasn't cared enough.
\
But many involved in the restoration effort - both inside the official government program as well as activists, academics and observers on the outside - have shelved their complaints in the last year. There's been a renewed sense of commitment to the bay and a new series of efforts at the federal level.
\
Chuck Fox has been trying to clean up the Chesapeake Bay since 1983, working for the state, the feds and in the world of nonprofit organizations.
\
Now his title is ""senior adviser on the Chesapeake Bay and the Anacostia River"" for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
\
Sitting in his sparse Eastport office overlooking a parking lot, Fox pledges hope for the bay. But he doesn't have rose-colored glasses - he knows this is a tough fight.
\
""We will know much more whether we're succeeding or not in the next year,"" he said.
\
Why is the next year so important?
\
There are perhaps three answers to that question, all in the form of government-ese: total maximum daily load, Executive Order 13508 and the Chesapeake Clean Water Act.
\
Fox calls those three actions a ""three-legged stool"" that stands a good chance of finally making a significant difference in the health of the Chesapeake.
\
The total maximum daily load or TMDL is often called a ""pollution budget"" or ""pollution diet.""
\
Right now, the feds and the states are figuring out the maximum amount of pollution the bay can handle and dividing it among the rivers that feed the bay. By 2025, state and local governments should have all the programs in place to get the pollution down to the assigned numbers.
\
Along the way, the federal government can step in with sanctions - yanking funding, blocking permits - if state's aren't doing a good enough job.
\
TMDLs are in place in waterways all over the country and don't often make much of a difference. But Fox said the Chesapeake's plan could be different. He said the Clean Water Act has specific language that allows the EPA to better enforce the bay's pollution diet.
\
""We are trying to implement the TMDL program here in the Chespeake Bay in an innovative way to improve accountability,"" Fox said, promising the plan will be ""rigorous.""
\
In addition to the pollution budget, federal agencies are working to improve their bay cleanup efforts following an executive order issued last year by President Barack Obama.
\
The executive order - No. 13508 - declares the bay ""a national treasure"" and calls on the federal government to do more for the bay. Their plans are to be finalized this May, one year after Obama issued the order.
\
As well, Congress is considering a bill from Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings and others called the Chesapeake Clean Water Act.
\
The bill requires many things that already are being done through the pollution budget and the executive order. But it also sends more money to the Chesapeake to pay for cleanup, and it sets up a program to allow the trading of pollution credits, much like the ""cap-and-trade"" programs for greenhouse gas emissions to the air.
\
Will it work?
\
Coble of the bay foundation said the pollution budget, the executive order and the attention in Congress give her hope for the bay's future.
\
What's most critical, she said, is making sure that the pollution budget is enforceable - that there will be consequences if promises are broken.
\
The lack of consequences has been a key criticism of the bay cleanup programs up until now.
\
Bay cleanup agreements, signed again and again by governors and federal officials in splashy events, haven't had any consequences built into them. They had goals that were so far out in the future that the people who signed the agreements were no longer in office by the time the goals came due.
\
Now, bay governors are working on two-year promises for pollution reductions as they work on the long-term goal of the pollution budget and getting the bay off the list of the nation's ""impaired waters"" by 2025.
\
Coble, who has spent her career working on the bay, said the key players in bay restoration have learned from their mistakes.
\
She remembers hashing out the details and language of the Chesapeake 2000 agreement. That agreement set a cleanup deadline of 2010, a goal that very clearly has been blown.
\
""Everybody at the table is a lot smarter,"" Coble said. ""I'm not going to make the same mistakes.""
\
Still, restoring the health of the Chesapeake Bay is going to cost money - which is in short supply - and it's going to require changing attitudes, she said.
\
While the debates have shifted from ""what do we have to do"" to ""how do we do it,"" Coble said there's still too much finger pointing.
\
Often, she said, one industry or region begs off of making changes because they only contribute a certain percent of overall pollution.
\
""If you're saying, 'I contribute,' then you stop and say, 'I have work to do,' "" Coble said.
\
Trumbauer, the riverkeeper, shares Coble's concern.
\
He said the most common thing he hears is: ""That's such a small part of the problem, why should we bother? The real problem is 'fill-in-the-blank.' ""
\
""Guess what?"" Trumbauer said. ""Every single pollution source is saying the same thing. It's an endless circle.""
\
In recent weeks, developers and boaters have made arguments along those lines in the General Assembly in attempts to defeat bills requiring improved stormwater controls on new developments and expanding ""no discharge"" zones for treated boat waste.
\
Fox, the EPA adviser on the bay, said he thinks bay cleanup is possible. It won't be easy, but he points to air quality as inspiration.
\
""We, as a nation, have seen dramatic improvement in air quality,"" he said.
\
It hasn't been cheap, and often it's been controversial, but America's skies are cleaner than they used to be. Perhaps the same is in store for the Chesapeake Bay.
\
Fox points to two other signs of hope for the bay.
\
First, elected officials and government leaders finally understand the severe state the bay is in and what needs to be done. Politicians know they can't support only minor bay efforts - voters are demanding serious action.
\
Secondly, the Chesapeake Bay is in the residents' souls, he said. Marylanders are demanding a clean, healthy Chesapeake Bay and should settle for nothing less, he said.
\
""The Chesapeake Bay defines Maryland,"" Fox said. ""Here in Anne Arundel County, the bay is around almost every corner. The Chesapeake Bay defines who we are.""

89,"Readers of The Baltimore Sun's Maryland Politics blog weighed in Monday on the final actions of the General Assembly, which adjourned at midnight.\Blog commenter Mark Newgent said utility ratepayers were big losers in this year's session.\""Forget the red herring of re-regulation. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act will significantly increase our electric and energy rates. Despite its failure in Europe, cap and trade is on its way to Maryland. Expect higher rates and energy rationing all for no impact on the climate.""\Reader Mark Anderson said he wasn't all that impressed with either the Democrats or the Republicans this year.\""It's pretty obvious that Governor [Martin] O'Malley comes up short this session. All his signature initiatives have gone unfulfilled.\""Death penalty, environment, slots, driver's licenses, marriage all ended in compromise. Having exhausted all his political capital last year in getting slots, we are still no closer to a video lottery terminal than we were 18 months ago.\""Unable to close the deal, one has to wonder who will step up next year to offer a primary challenge to O'Malley.\""Honorable Mention: Loser - the Republican Party. With such a weak governor, the Party offers no viable alternative. The Republican buffoons in the House of Delegates offer mindless amendments to delay legislation and present no real leadership or vision to take advantage of O'Malley's weaknesses.""\The legislature's last-minute efforts to enact legislation allowing the state to obtain the Preakness Stakes through eminent domain didn't sit well with a number of readers.\""Of all the problems the state is facing, especially financial problems, this is among the last issues lawmakers should be concerned about,"" blog commenter PK wrote. ""Horse racing is a dying sport, and I don't believe that will change anytime soon.""\The state budget was a major concern for a number of readers, including commenter Believe, who said things are only likely to get worse.\""April 15th deadline + week or two for Comptroller to garner revenue numbers will be real telling. Remember the last 4 meetings of the Spending Affordability Committee have seen lowered revenue each time. The current state budget is balanced under the idea that the next meeting will have equal or greater revenue - something most analysts consider a vast shirking of responsibility.""\To join the conversation, go to www.baltimoresun.com/marylandpolitics."
90,"A committee sharply divided between some of the Senate's leading environmentalists and the body's most outspoken critic of green initiatives is scheduled to vote today on imposing the nation's first limits on greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming.\At the center of the likely fireworks is a bipartisan measure that is both too sympathetic to polluters and yet faces a blizzard of amendments from industry backers who hope to weaken the bill or bury it altogether.\The extremes on both ends can't be allowed to kill this vital legislation. Warnings from the scientific community about the impact of global climate change grow ever more dire. The time for putting pollution curbs in place is passing rapidly. The Senate measure sponsored by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and John W. Warner of Virginia may not be perfect, but it's a good start and may be further improved by the committee today.\The so-called cap-and-trade proposal sets short-term and long-term goals for reducing emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, from industries that burn fossil fuels. Companies would be allowed to exchange pollution credits among themselves to meet the overall target. As currently written, the bill calls for a 15 percent reduction from 2005 levels by 2020. By 2050, emission levels would be reduced by about 63 percent.\Those targets are not as ambitious as they should be. The United States is such a major emitter of greenhouse gases that some scientists argue its 2050 target should be an 80 percent drop from 2005 levels.\Further, the bill's sponsors chose not to auction off about half of the pollution credits to industry. Instead, the government would give away those very valuable credits, especially in the beginning, creating a windfall for the worst polluters and limiting revenue that could be raised.\Barbara Boxer of California, chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, supports a much stronger measure and is expected to move to tighten the auction provision today. But she had to compromise in order to blunt concerns about the economic impact of higher energy costs. Working vigorously against her is James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, ranking Republican on the committee, who has called man-made global warming ""the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.""\This country is still so backward on dealing with climate change that the U.S. is something of a pariah at the 180-nation U.N. Climate Change Conference under way in Bali, Indonesia. With the recent re-election defeat of Australian Prime Minister John Howard, America is the only major industrialized power still resisting mandatory pollution caps.\So, Mrs. Boxer and her committee allies - including Maryland's Benjamin L. Cardin - would be wise to take the toughest bill they can get, and work to fix the flaws later."
91,"One disappointment in a presidential race seemingly lowering the bar of expectations by the day is the lack of conversation about climate change. Even with the financial crisis and the war in Iraq, there are few more pressing issues, not only because of how disastrous global warming will be for the nation's - and world's - economy, health, security and environment but also because we're running out of time to do much about it.\Fortunately, whichever candidate is elected, the 44th president of the United States is likely to take far greater action than the 43rd, but given President Bush's relative inaction that's not saying much. Both the Republican and Democratic nominees have at least recognized the threat and have pledged to take significant action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this country and around the world.\How do their plans compare? On balance, Sen. Barack Obama has offered to take stronger action than Sen. John McCain. In the critical area of carbon pricing, for instance, Mr. Obama would expect carbon producers to compete for 100 percent of offsets under a cap-and-trade approach, while Mr. McCain would give some allowances away - essentially grandfathering some greenhouse gases.\Mr. Obama also sets a goal of an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 compared with Mr. McCain's 60 percent. The Illinois Democrat would spend more on renewable power and research and development as well as give a higher tax credit for zero-carbon vehicles. And he offers a specific target for energy efficiency - 15 percent below projected demand by 2020. Mr. McCain sets no such goal.\Nuclear energy may play an important role in reducing greenhouse gases, but the Arizona Republican's seemingly unconditional love for the industry gives pause. Mr. Obama is willing to support nuclear power but only if waste storage, proliferation and safety concerns are addressed.\Unfortunately, the few times that climate change has been raised during the campaign, it's usually been about the development of so-called green jobs or about national security and the country's dependence on foreign oil. Those are certainly valid points (and political appealing ones to discuss), but they don't tell the whole story. What the candidates are not talking about is the urgency of the problem and some of the difficult decisions that must be made, including ending subsidies to carbon producers (particularly big oil), halting the development of conventional coal-burning power plants and investing far more money in mass transit. Ultimately, addressing global warming will require some short-term sacrifice.\Merely to blunt the effects of climate change and have some credibility in negotiations with the rest of the world, including critical players such as China and Russia, the U.S. would have to go substantially further than what either candidate has proposed. But of the two, Senator Obama is at least offering the more ambitious proposals and represents the nation's best hope for averting disaster."
92,"
A regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program plans to drastically cut the pollutants that can be emitted in the Northeast, including Maryland.
\
Nine states participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which caps carbon dioxide emissions and requires facilities that emit carbon, such as power plants, to buy credits at auctions.
\
Under the proposal announced Thursday, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, will lower the cap on carbon dioxide emissions from 165 million tons to 91 million tons -- a reduction of nearly 45 percent.
\
The reduction will take place gradually between 2015 and 2020.
\
The money generated by the credits is used for energy efficiency programs and energy assistance for low-income families. Through September, the credits generated $1.08 billion, according to RGGI.
\
For the average residential electric customer, that translates to about 43 cents per month, according to RGGI.
\
Maryland has participated ever since trading began in 2008, after state lawmakers passed the Healthy Air Act in 2006. The law required the state to join. Participating states include Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.
\
Environmentalists were quick to praise the proposal; others criticized it.
\
Gov. Martin O'Malley said in a statement that the proposal ""will result in meaningful environmental and public benefits.""
\
Those praising the proposal included Environment Maryland, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and a Boston-based group called Businesses for a Clean Economy.
\
Americans for Prosperity, however, said the reduced cap will hurt utility customers.
\
Steve Lonegan, AFP's New Jersey state director, called RGGI ""a job-killing tax with zero benefit.""
\
New Jersey participated in RGGI until 2011, when Gov. Chris Christie withdrew the state. At the time, Christie said that while he believes climate change is a real problem and that human actions likely contribute to it, RGGI wasn't effective at reducing greenhouse gasses.
\
Carbon dioxide is a key component of the greenhouse effect that traps the sun's heat in the atmosphere. If greenhouse gas concentrations rise too high, it could lead to rising sea levels and shifting climate patterns, which could be devastating.

"
93," WASHINGTON - To understand why Americans hold the current Congress in such low esteem, look no further than the energy bill passed last week.\ The United States faces serious energy problems. Our dependence on Middle East oil cripples us in the fight against terror. Greenhouse gas emissions are out of control, playing havoc with the climate. High gas prices and gas-guzzling cars squeeze family budgets. Other nations have surpassed the U.S. in the huge and growing market for clean energy technologies.\ Yet the energy legislation solves none of these problems. Instead, it is a grab bag of special interest favors, many of which lavish taxpayer dollars on allies of the congressional leadership. The most egregious provision appears to be one inserted into the legislation after the House-Senate conference committee (so members had no chance to vote on it) steering $1 billion to a private consortium in Majority Leader Tom DeLay's district in Texas. But there are many more.\ The bill showers tax breaks on domestic oil and gas producers already benefiting from record high prices. It exempts many of these producers from rules intended to protect the quality of our drinking water. It authorizes preliminary steps to explore for oil in sensitive marine areas. Perhaps worst of all, it squanders the opportunity to put forward serious legislation that would actually address our pressing energy problems.\ What would serious national energy legislation look like?\ First, it would break our dependence on Middle East oil. It is nothing short of a scandal that nearly four years after 9/11, we have failed to take meaningful steps to address this dependence. We know what it takes: improving the efficiency of our auto fleet, developing domestic energy resources and helping build a network of strategic petroleum reserves around the world.\ Those who say it can't be done should look no further than Brazil, where drivers can choose between conventional gasoline and cheaper ethanol. The hottest-selling cars in Brazil today are ""flex- fuel"" - giving drivers a choice of fuel type. During the past several decades, as the percentage of U.S. oil imports has increased, Brazil has weaned itself from foreign oil.\ Second, a serious energy bill would bring greenhouse gas emissions under control. With scientists sounding alarm bells about the risks of uncontrolled global warming, the time has come for basic, common-sense measures.\ In June, the Senate passed a resolution calling for ""mandatory, market-based measures"" to control heat-trapping gases. It's time for Congress to translate that resolution into specific legislation that controls greenhouse gases, using a ""cap-and-trade"" program similar to the one launched in 1990 by the first President Bush to control acid rain, which has been wildly successful.\ Third, the legislation would put the United States in the lead again in the global market for clean energy technologies such as wind power and clean coal. Japan, Germany and Denmark have surpassed the United States as vendors of clean energy. But with proper leadership, we can build the U.S. industrial base in this area and create many jobs. The federal government has a critical role in supporting advanced research and helping U.S. exporters compete in rapidly growing foreign markets.\ Let's hope Congress will pass a new energy bill worthy of its name.\ David Sandalow is director of the Environment and Energy Project at the Brookings Institution."
94,"To the person who stole our outdoor autumn yard decorations: Enjoy!\Throughout my travels in Ocean Pines, I hope I do not see them in your yard.\Jim Morkosky\Ocean Pines\Kratovil is hardly an independent\I heard Congressman Frank Kratovil's campaign commercial in which he paints himself as one of the most independent members of Congress. Yet, according to The Washington Post vote database, Kratovil had voted with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrat Congressional majority almost 85 percent of the time as of June 28. Is this voting record indicative of someone who acts independently of his Party's leadership?\His voting record on key issues, important to the American people, clearly doesn't support his claim of ""independence"" either.\During campaign speeches, Kratovil proudly proclaims he voted against the Health Care Reform Bill (H.R. 3200). What he fails to say is that he had the chance to send this same bill back to committee, but voted against such action.\So, he initially voted against the bill, and then later he voted for it. Why didn't he stand up for what he so proudly espoused and vote to send the bill back to committee? Did he cave in to political pressure from Pelosi and the Democratic leadership?\Kratovil also voted for Pelosi's Energy Tax Bill (H.R. 2454) and cap and trade, knowing full well it will have a devastating impact on Eastern Shore's farmers and poultry growers.\Heritage Foundation research estimates such energy tax legislation will reduce farm profits by 28 percent starting in 2012. Further, the Congressional Budget Office estimates this legislation will cost the American family $1,600 each year in energy costs.\Why does Kratovil completely disregard the voice of the American people and align himself with programs which will have a devastating and lasting effect on our local economy and families? Frank Kratovil is not an independent. May I suggest you vote for Andy Harris instead.\Jeff Morse\Ocean Pines\Ocean City Beach Patrol's intervention was a lifesaver\I want to thank the Ocean City Beach Patrol for the wonderful service they provided to my sister and myself. On Aug. 28 we were caught in a powerful riptide at 127th Street. If not for the beach patrol, we could have drowned. The guard spotted us, and was there in less than a minute. I read that there were nearly 500 rescues that weekend.\I have been coming to Ocean City my entire life, and have been a part-time resident for the last 10 years. In all of this time I have never needed the beach patrol, but always appreciated their presence. I have felt confident in their abilities to watch over my children, and now grandchildren, as they played in the surf. I never imagined that I would need their services myself.\Thank you so much for all you do to provide a safe swimming environment to all of us at the beach. I have always had a healthy respect for the ocean, but now have a first-hand experience of how quickly things can happen.\Cathy L. Carter\Goldsboro, Md."
95,"WASHINGTON - -The federal Environmental Protection Agency would be given enhanced authority to clean up pollution in the Chesapeake Bay under legislation now being shaped in Congress, Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland said Monday.\A new, regionwide pollutant-trading system is another likely feature of the measure, designed to update the struggling, 26-year-old Chesapeake Bay program. The regional partnership, which includes the federal government, District of Columbia, Maryland and five other states in the bay watershed, has repeatedly failed to meet voluntary cleanup goals.\Cardin, in an interview after the second in a series of hearings on the proposed legislation, said the Environment and Public Works Committee's Water and Wildlife Subcommittee that he chairs sees the 1972 Clean Air Act as a model for a ""nutrient trading"" system and for ""giving enforcement to the EPA"" over the bay program.\Under the proposal, which the Democrat hopes Congress will approve this year, EPA would get new power to impose sanctions on states that fail to meet cleanup targets. These could include bans on new development.\Maryland Natural Resources Secretary John R. Griffin, in formal testimony, said that Gov. Martin O'Malley's administration believes that the most effective sanctions would be ""the suspension of authority to issue new hookups to public wastewater systems and the ability of local governments to issue building permits.""\With Democrats in charge of Congress and the White House, bay cleanup efforts are getting increased attention from Washington for the first time in years.\President Barack Obama signed an executive order in May that made cleanup of the bay a national priority. At the time, EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said the federal government would begin negotiating with the states on an enforcement strategy, though there have been no announcements since then.\Cardin said the Senate also is likely to consider a water pollutant-trading program for the bay, modeled after a 1990 law that created a cap-and-trade system to reduce acid rain from coal-fired electric plants. The new plan would be aimed primarily at the politically sensitive problem of reducing agricultural runoff, blamed for an estimated 40 percent of overall bay pollution.\Virginia and Pennsylvania, have nutrient-trading programs.\The trading idea has received a generally favorable reception from state and local officials, and some environmentalists. But one clear objection was heard at the Senate hearing.\James M. Tierney, an assistant commissioner of the New York state Environmental Conservation Department, said the proposal posed a problem because of the sheer magnitude of the bay cleanup problem.\Making the bay healthy once again will require ""everything by everybody everywhere,"" Tierney said, down to the smallest road ditch. ""Every retrofit needs to happen.""\In other words, he explained, the cleanup would need both the farmers' contribution and an improved wastewater treatment plant as well.\Griffin, the Maryland official, also expressed caution. Later, in an interview, he said that a trading system would have to be drafted very carefully to guarantee that it worked.\Critics have long contended that the EPA already has much of the enforcement power it needs, under the Clean Water Act, to reduce the flow of various pollutants into the bay. In January, a coalition of environmentalists and others filed a federal lawsuit asking the courts to order the EPA to take over the bay cleanup effort.\Conservative opposition to enhancing the EPA's authority surfaced from a Republican on the Senate panel. ""I know firsthand that voluntary environmental programs are very successful,"" Oklahoma's James M. Inhofe said, noting recent efforts to reduce runoff into the Illinois River. ""My state's experience is that heavy-handed regulations that ignore economic realities and property rights do not work.""\Credit: paul.west@baltsun.com"

Economic growth in Virginia last year was 0.6 percent, he said.\Gillespie called for policies reflecting ""conservative Constitutional principles of limited, effective government"" -- including lowering taxes, repealing mandates and ""scaling back regulations.""\""Those are the things that will unleash economic growth here in Virginia,"" he said.\Gillespie said he wants to cut individual income tax rates -- if that happens, it will be the first such cut in 45 years, he said.\""My opponent has a long record in the General Assembly of supporting tax increases,"" he said.\A tax cut would make it easier for individuals to open and operate small businesses, Gillespie said.\Gillespie also spoke in support of the state's right to work laws.\""I do not believe you should have to join a union to get a job in Virginia,"" he said.\On education, Gillespie said, ""No child in Virginia should be trapped in a failing public school. If you believe, like I do that the proper role of government is not to ensure equality of outcomes for people, but equality of opportunity for people, then you've got to make sure every child has access to a good, safe, quality school -- and my policies will do that.""\On energy, Gillespie said he does not agree with Northam, who he said supports a cap-and-trade policy on emissions and wants the state to adhere to the Paris accords.\""That will just result in more miners being laid off in our west, but also factory workers, and make it harder for us to foster advanced manufacturing,"" he said, claiming the policies also will increase electric bills.\On public safety, Gillespie said if he is elected, he will sign legislation banning ""sanctuary cities"" in Virginia. The term typically is used to describe places that limit local cooperation with federal immigration agents.\""I will sign a sanctuary city bill in a heartbeat ... We have got to keep Virginians safe in our neighborhoods, in our communities, in our businesses,"" he said.\Gillespie said the upcoming election is not just about the next four years.\""I think it's about the next 20 to 30 years ...

98,"The O'Malley administration's aggressive new plan to fight climate change calls for Maryland residents to further cut their energy use or face higher monthly utility bills.\The plan, to be released today by Gov. Martin O'Malley, also requires that more of the state's electricity come from renewable sources by 2020. \Maryland's goals for reducing greenhouse gases are among the most ambitious in the nation. The plan requires stricter measures than previously proposed to meet the requirement set by the General Assembly in 2009 to cut carbon emissions that scientists say drive climate change. \""Although it might seem high, it's really the first step, the first down payment that we need to make in order to avoid a real climate catastrophe in the world,"" said Donald Boesch, president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. \A business policy group criticized the proposal, pointing out that efforts in such a small state won't alter the course of climate change but will directly affect people's expenses. \""It's a laudable goal, but there's a countervailing issue that the consumers are getting hit directly with the costs to do it,"" said Kim Burns, president of Maryland Business for Responsive Government. ""If it's going to take money out of people's pocketbooks and it's not going to have a measurable impact, why do it?"" \The two pieces expected to cut the most carbon emissions already cost residential customers about $2.60 per month unless they use a state program to curb energy use. State officials expect the new plan to make that cost slightly higher. \State officials say the plan will create significant economic benefits, bringing 37,000 jobs and netting more than $1 billion for Maryland's economy. \Mike Tidwell, executive director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network called it a ""credible and very effective plan"" that would ""trigger market changes in fuel consumption."" \""Maryland, as a state, cannot single-handedly solve global warming,"" Tidwell said. But given its 4,000 miles of shoreline and vulnerability to rising sea levels, he said, ""Maryland should lead by example."" \Maryland is one of eight states whose laws require a cut in greenhouse gases. Maryland's goal to reduce emissions to 25 percent below its 2006 levels is the second-most-aggressive plan in the country behind California's. \Maryland's 2009 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act, which passed with bipartisan support, requires the governor to develop a plan that meets that goal without causing economic harm. State lawmakers are required to vote in 2015 whether to continue with the plan O'Malley will present today or send him back to the drawing board. \Part of the new plan calls for increasing Maryland's reliance on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar to 25 percent of electricity generation in the state by 2020. The previous goal was 20 percent by 2022. \""These are tough things to achieve,"" said state Secretary of the Environment Robert M. Summers. ""It would have been done by now if it were easy."" \Electricity rates are expected to rise as the state uses more renewable sources, but state officials said higher electric bills could be offset by using less electricity through energy-efficient appliances, switching off lights in empty rooms, setting the thermostat a little higher in the summer, plugging air leaks in homes or upgrading insulation, among other techniques. \Much of Maryland's plan involves programs, agreements and federal laws that are already in place. The state participates in a regional cap-and-trade system that calls for reducing emissions from its coal-burning power plants. Already, Maryland requires new cars and trucks to have the country's highest fuel efficiency. \Other pieces of the plan include creating newer, greener building codes and more public transit, putting less trash in landfills, and planting or replanting 43,030 acres of forest. \ecox@baltsun.com\Credit: The Baltimore Sun"
99,"ONLEY -- Some 100 Eastern Shore residents turned out Thursday afternoon for a candidates' forum sponsored by the Woman's Club of Accomack County held to hear from the three candidates vying to represent Virginia's 2nd District in the United States House of Representatives.\Speaking at the forum were incumbent Rep. Glenn Nye (D), who is seeking a second term; Independent candidate Kenny Golden; and Del. Brenda Pogge, who represents the 96th District in the Virginia House of Delegates and spoke on behalf of Republican candidate Scott Rigell. Rigell had another engagement and was unable to attend the forum. His wife and son were in attendance along with Pogge.\Rigell has attended several other events on the Eastern Shore during the campaign, including at events held at Captain's Cove in Greenbackville and the Sunrise Restaurant in Onley, among others.\The candidates and Pogge each had seven minutes to introduce themselves and make their case to the voters at the forum, followed by an informal meet and greet period during which individuals could speak with the candidates.\The format was a departure from past Woman's Club forums where a public question and answer session was included. The elimination of the question and answer period was done at the request of one of the campaigns, Woman's Club Legislative Chairwoman Valena Gibb said. She declined to identify which candidate made the request.\Pogge spoke first and cited her and Rigell's shared conservative principles.\Pogge said Rigell favors limited government and a return to ""what the Founding Fathers intended.""\Rigell, 50, owns Freedom Automotive in Virginia Beach, which he founded in 1991. His automobile dealerships in Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Chesapeake employ over 240 people.\He served for six years in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and earned a bachelor's degree from Mercer University and an M.B.A. from Regent University.\Pogge said the name of Rigell's business reflects his beliefs and praised his experience as a businessman and his plan to support energy independence for the United States.

100,"Thanks for the excellent article by Maddy Lauria in the Oct. 3 issue of Delaware Coast Press, ""Strong home market could be masking sea level rise impact.""\Not only is sea level rise/flooding impacting home prices adversely by billions of dollars from Florida to Connecticut, as mentioned in the report, but insurance rates are rising so high that this increase in rates may drive people from the shore before the sea level rise does.\At a recent forum in Lewes, a shore town mayor pointed out that a typical home paid $5,000 per year for home insurance with flood coverage a few years ago. Now it is up to $35,000-plus per year.\So it is not just those concerned about the environment who recognize the seriousness of climate change, but ""green-eye-shade"" insurance actuaries, numbers guys dispassionately looking at the facts.\It's time we all get together to stop climate change on both sides of the aisle. One good way is to use a market-based technique pioneered by President Reagan (hole in the ozone layer champion) and President Bush I (acid rain champion) that puts a price on polluting carbon fuel.\Call it cap and trade as these presidents did, or a carbon fee, as I prefer, they both put a price on pollution, so people will use less of the fuel as the price gets higher.\What to do with the fees collected is up for discussion. I prefer giving all the money back to American families as a monthly dividend check. This should appeal to conservatives as it doesn't ""grow the size of government.""\Charlie Garlow\Citizens' Climate Lobby, Lower Delaware\Rehoboth Beach\Even on my best days I have to admit that I would not want to be in law enforcement. What a tough, tough job.\However, a recent article (""Philly man: I did not punch police horse,"" Oct. 10) reminded me that a few police misuse their power. When the cops are aided and abetted by other members of the legal system, misuse of power quickly becomes abuse of power.\Gavin Coco is from Philly, although in his defense he graduated from Sussex Tech. By his own admission, at times he has likely been somewhat of a party animal with minor legal infractions when vacationing in Dewey.\However, in late May this year he and a friend were watching police making arrests in a ""disorderly and angry (Dewey) crowd"" from a distance. Mounted Delaware State Police (DSP) apparently became agitated when Coco's friend began videoing the scene, asking the two to ""back up"" and telling them ""it's time to leave.""\As the mounted DSP bumped and crowded Coco and friend against a police car, a horse stepped on Coco's foot prompting one DSP officer to shout ""He touched my horse!""\After that, it was essentially a classic ""they said vs they said"" about what actually happened—until surveillance video was released much later. In the meantime, Coco was charged with offensively touching an officer. With that the ""fun"" began.\As per the video, Coco never touched any officer, so prosecutors amended the charge to offensively touching the horse. Apparently there is no such statute to violate. Later, prosecutors tried to file charges of harassment against Coco — which were rejected by the court.\In the end and with a very rare move, Judge Rosemary Beauregard dismissed the case against Coco ""with prejudice"" for prosecutors ""illegally charging"" him with touching the horse, later attempting to alter the charges and failing to release the surveillance video to Coco's attorney in a timely fashion. The ""with prejudice"" is significant as Coco's arrest will be completely expunged.\Obviously the DSP made some mistakes that May night. DSP says their Internal Affairs unit ""will investigate."" An investigation is welcome, but corrective discipline for the mistakes is what is really needed. At the very least Coco merits an apology from the DSP officers for their overreaction(s).\However, the most egregious part of this not-so-comical farce were those who carried out the the false charging, manipulative changing of charges and the formulation of unjustified new harassment charges against Coco.\Police/prosecutors also withheld the exculpatory surveillance video without justification. These malicious actions were directed at Coco over a period of months. The individuals who perpetrated these calculated injustices should be terminated for cause and they owe Coco just restitution.\Let us hear from DSP and/or the DOJ (Delaware Department of Justice) about remedy for these injustices carried out by their personnel.\Dan Cannon\Seaford\Flooding can pose serious problems along the Delaware Coast and in communities along the Inland Bays.\CHUCK SNYDER file photo"
101,"Donald Trump would be a harmless anachronism - some cranky old guy who watches Fox News too much, resents smart people and denies climate change - if he were not president. He would be nothing but the clubhouse loudmouth.\But because he's president, Trump has the power to inflict great damage to progressive policies, alienate allies, diminish the country's role as a world leader and make millions of Americans feel ashamed.\So far, mission accomplished.\Pulling the United States out of the Accorde de Paris on climate change might have been Trump's tour de force - an ill-informed, spiteful rejection of science and statesmanship in the face of international agreement that those of us alive today have a special responsibility to future generations.\Trump will turn 71 on June 14. You'd think a guy with five children and eight grandchildren, with a ninth expected in September, would look past petty politics to the biggest picture of all: the future of life on Earth. But taking the grand view on environmental issues, as moderate Republicans once did, requires thinking and reflection, an embrace of science and the magnanimity to admit that the smart people on the left are right about something. Trump and his crowd seem incapable of that, or determined to work against it.\Still, there's a bright side to the decision to pull out of the Paris accord, in the form of immediate pledges to live up to the agreement. The pledges came from political leaders in cities and states that already have made progress on carbon emissions and renewable energy. The pledges came from corporations and academia, too.\In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan could easily join this movement, because along the Chesapeake Bay we have what Don Boesch, a leading climate scientist, calls a ""precious consensus"" to protect the bay and curtail global warming. It's been around for years.\When you review what's been happening on the environmental front in this oddly-shaped Mid-Atlantic state, Trump's destructive powers start to look overstated. He looks more fossil than president.\""The biggest challenge we have with a runaway problem [climate change] is it's hard to turn it around,"" says Boesch, the longtime president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science and a member of the Maryland Climate Change Commission. ""There are still forces working against the gains we've made - vehicle emissions, for instance.\""But [greenhouse gas] emissions are still tracking downward, and we have some confidence that [Maryland] will make our 2020 goal of a 25 percent reduction, though we still need to do more to make that happen. And then we have another heavy lift: Another 40 percent reduction by 2030.""\The progress so far has been achieved in several different ways:\*Maryland's statutory requirement that 25 percent of the state's electricity come from renewable sources by 2020. The previous requirement was for 20 percent by 2022. Legislative analysts estimated the change could raise residential electricity bills anywhere from 48 cents to $1.45 per month.\*The state's adoption of the California standards for motor vehicles, setting limits for ozone-depleting emissions stricter than those the federal government requires.\*Membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade consortium of Northeastern states working toward reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, increased investment in energy efficiency and cuts in pollution.\Just a few weeks ago, the Maryland Public Service Commission approved ratepayer subsidies - $1 on monthly residential electricity bills - to support two wind farms off Ocean City. They could constitute the largest offshore project of its kind in the nation. Dozens of wind turbines could be in place from 14 miles to 20 miles off Ocean City by 2020. The wind farms are expected to prevent emissions of hundreds of thousands of pounds of carbon dioxide and create some 5,000 jobs.\And then there's Hogan. The Republican governor can boast support of important initiatives to combat climate change: the state's accelerated effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, additional tax credits for electric vehicles, additional rebates for charging stations and increased state investment in clean energy innovations.\Boesch says all these efforts, plus state support of energy conservation programs, have worked in Maryland's favor. He feels the climate change commission, chaired by Ben Grumbles, the state secretary of the environment, is in good hands, and its work has been supported.\So it's not all grim. With an even greater push on the climate change front, Maryland and other progressive states could render the president of the United States irrelevant.\drodricks@baltsun.com\Credit: Dan ;Rodricks - drodricks@baltsun.com"
102,"With the revised route for the Keystone XL pipeline having last week won approval from Nebraska's Republican governor, the geology of North America's most controversial energy project is clear: It has landed President Barack Obama between a rock and a hard place.\Having campaigned for an ""all of the above"" energy policy but also having announced that addressing climate change will be a top priority during his second term, President Obama must choose between enabling TransCanada's petroleum exports and preventing what climatologists fear will quickly provide a huge and disastrous new boost in greenhouse gases. \Still, the decision may not be so difficult if Mr. Obama sticks to one guiding principle: What is in the best interests of the United States -- the jobs associated with construction of the multibillion-dollar project, or the risks posed by climate change and enabling greater global addiction to petroleum from a particularly troubling source? \On that basis, the risks far outweigh the rewards. The U.S. State Department should reject the project simply out of concern for the health, safety and security of U.S. citizens. Rising sea levels, severe storms, droughts and the risk posed to agriculture, and the potential for political disruption on a world scale all are associated with global warming. \And make no mistake, the Keystone pipeline is not just another incremental step in petroleum distribution. The crude oil would come from Canadian tar sands, the dirtiest possible source of petroleum, according to a 2012 Congressional Research Service study. Burning tar sands oil is bad enough, but even extracting it is highly polluting. \It's all very well for political leaders to decry the excess carbon emissions that are slowly raising the temperature of this planet, but that trend won't reverse unless the line is drawn somewhere. Surely, a project like Keystone -- which is not even expected to help U.S. consumers by reducing domestic gasoline or heating oil prices -- is a reasonable place to start. \Of course, such a choice is going to raise quite a hue and cry from the petroleum industry and its friends in Congress. But it's amusing to note that many of those same companies are not shy in raising the climate-change issue when it comes to promoting domestic natural gas, which burns far cleaner than coal. \Other critics will play the ""E"" cards and rail against the president for not putting the economy and energy independence first. Yet how much good Keystone does either is doubtful, particularly if enabling (if not expanding) global dependence on oil greatly harms this nation's growing green energy producers. \Don't want to rely on oil from the Middle East and other less-than-dependable sources? The country has already ratcheted down that reliance in recent years, and the secret is to both increase U.S. drilling where appropriate and to burn less oil, either through conservation (such as requiring greater energy efficiency) or by expanding use of renewable energy. \Climate change is not some far-off, theoretical threat. Its effects are real and already being felt. Has anyone noticed this week's stunningly volatile weather pattern? Experts say we can expect a lot more of that -- along with disastrous weather like superstorm Sandy, which is already costing the country tens of billions of dollars. That experience alone should have taught Congress what is at stake in the climate change debate. \The fact that there continue to be so many climate change deniers in the Republican-controlled House simply underscores the need for President Obama to take action when and where he can. The Keystone decision is his administration's alone, and politics ought not enter a decision-making process that should be governed by science and the facts. \Will he take some heat? Absolutely, but if the president's committed to pushing for controversial remedies to climate change like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade law, he will have a tough time explaining how he could have first approved a project like Keystone that is so harmful to the environment. Besides, polls show the public wants action on climate change, and that could help Democrats in 2014. Mr. Obama put off the Keystone decision last year and won re-election handily, a sign that TransCanada doesn't drive public opinion in this country now or in 2014.\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
103,"WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney imposed a health care mandate, then opposed it. Tim Pawlenty touted a climate change plan that he now disowns. Ditto Jon Huntsman.\Republican presidential contenders aren't just debating one another these days. They're disputing their own decisions and disavowing past positions. Their pirouettes are a reflection of a profound shift in the Republican Party, a rightward turn that will be evident on a New Hampshire stage Monday when seven candidates meet in the first major debate of the 2012 campaign. The debate, from 8 to 10 p.m. Eastern, will be televised by CNN.\Primary contests typically move presidential candidates closer to their party's base. And because staunchly conservative voters may have the biggest say in choosing the GOP nominee, it's hardly surprising that candidates have been moving to the right. But the extent of repositioning by some leading contenders has been unusually pronounced this time.\""When there's a strong, establishment-backed front-runner, that candidate is usually in a better position to withstand the gravitational pull from the party base,"" said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California and a former Republican strategist. ""Because this race is so unsettled, none of the leading candidates has much strength or stature to resist.""\The perceived influence of tea party voters, who helped produce big Republican victories in last year's elections, has accentuated the swing to the right. So have the actions of the new Republican majority in the House and newly elected Republican governors. They are redefining conservatism, by proposing to turn Medicare into a voucher program, calling for draconian cuts in government spending and abandoning cap-and-trade energy alliances once favored by free-market advocates.\Republican presidential candidates have been forced to fall in line, or else. Those who don't, said Schnur, risk getting flak from ""grass-roots activists saying, 'Why can't you be more like Chris Christie, Marco Rubio or Paul Ryan?' "" - referring to non-candidates who have been begged to enter the race.\Case in point: the unraveling of Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign, which began after he criticized a Medicare plan from Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin, as ""right-wing social engineering"" (a reversal of Gingrich's previous support for Ryan's budget).\Some in the party establishment are worried.\Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, a former Republican National Committee chairman, has been warning about the dangers of ideological litmus tests. Barbour advised a recent gathering of Christian conservatives that ""purity is the enemy of victory"" in politics.\At the same time, President Barack Obama, aggressively gearing up for re-election, has compiled his own record of policy reversals. Politifact.com, which tracks what it calls ""full flops"" by prominent political figures, catalogs nine instances in which Obama made 180-degree turns, including his demand that Congress lift the federal debt limit, which he voted against as a senator.\Spared a primary challenge, the president started veering away from the left wing of his party after November's election.\paul.west@tribune.com\For the latest political news, go to trib.in/polnow\Candidates take aim\Several Republican presidential hopefuls ratcheted up their rhetoric Sunday on the eve of the first GOP debate in New Hampshire, signaling the launch of a more feisty debate as the campaign heads into the summer season.\The strongest shot came from former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who swiped at the health care plan signed into law by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Pawlenty said the polarizing health care reform measure championed by President Barack Obama amounted to ""Obamneycare."" ""President Obama said that he designed Obamacare after Romneycare and basically made it Obamneycare,"" Pawlenty said on ""Fox News Sunday.""\Romney's campaign responded by saying that ""Republicans should keep the focus on President Obama's failure to create jobs and control spending.""\Another prospective candidate, Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China, also stepped up his criticism of the president. He said on CNN's ""State of the Union"": ""You look at unemployment, you look at the environment in which jobs supposedly can be created, when you look at the debt level and you look at all the economic indicators, it would suggest that we're in bad shape.""\Romney and Huntsman fielded swipes from former Pennsylvania Sen.

104,"It seems that the man-made global warming scare, long promoted by those opposed to the burning of fossil fuel, is now behind us.\It turns out that there is no unanimity of scientists supporting man-made global warming theory and never has been. It's also now becoming widely recognized that there is no incontrovertible evidence that global warming is caused by human activity, and that there is quite a bit of evidence that human activity is not a primary cause of such warming.\It's becoming better known that for at least 240,000 years, a rise in CO2 has followed rather than preceded global warming. This squares with the reality that the oceans hold the vast majority of the Earth's carbon, and when the oceans warm, they release some of their gases into the atmosphere.\In fact, more than 95 percent of the much-touted Greenhouse Effect is the result of water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere, and carbon dioxide is a very tiny component of our atmosphere, comprising less than .04 of 1 percent of all gases present.\That information like this was not widely known until recently was, in part, a testament to the effectiveness of the global warming alarmists in suppressing the publication of dissenting opinion. But that suppression was exposed in the 2009 ""Climategate"" scandal, and the dialogue on climate change then improved drastically.\As a result, the American public no longer believes that man is primarily responsible for global warming. In monthly Rasmussen polling over the past two years, an average of 46 percent of those polled said that natural causes are responsible for global warming, while an average of 38 percent answered that human activity is the cause.\So, with the global warming scare behind us, we can return to worrying about and trying to solve real problems, right? Well, not quite yet. You see, we still have these regulations, pacts and plans that have evolved over the years - and are still evolving - to save the Earth from the catastrophe that was supposedly on the horizon.\For example, the European Union recently announced that beginning in 2012 it will be extending its cap-and-trade system tax to all airlines entering or leaving its airports, a tax that will likely be passed on to passengers on trans-Atlantic flights in the form of higher fares.\The U.S. government is currently in the process of tightening existing greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles sold here. And California has mandated that starting in 2012, major automakers will have to produce a certain number of zero-emissions vehicles (those that run on electricity) in order to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\Locally, Maryland has been very active over the past few years in efforts to protect its residents from the effects of climate change and to reduce the state's contribution to the problem. The state is one of 10 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states that belong to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a consortium that regulates the energy sector's CO2 emissions.\In 2007, Gov. Martin O'Malley established the Maryland Commission on Climate Change to address the causes of climate change and to help us prepare for the likely consequences. The commission's 2008 report, ""Climate Action Plan,"" presented strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and recommended development of state Smart Growth plans for protecting vulnerable areas.\Maryland's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act of 2009 requires the state to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by 2020 and directs the Maryland Department of the Environment to develop a plan to accomplish that goal.\The Maryland Department of Planning recently issued a revised draft of PlanMaryland - the state's plan for sustainable growth and development - which will soon be presented to the governor. The plan is premised, in part, on a link between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. It identifies locations in Maryland thought to be especially vulnerable to the effects of global warming and makes provisions to protect them to the extent possible from these effects.\The list goes on and on.\There is obviously nothing that can be done about the time and resources we've wasted so far attempting to address a non-existent problem. But one would think that at this point we'd be closing the faucet to stop the flow of money down the drain.\And given the influence a project like PlanMaryland is expected to have on growth in the state for decades, one would also think that we'd be reviewing and pulling from the plan any provision based on the bad premise of man-made global warming.\All those in favor ...\Richard Haddad, a Westminster resident, is a retired management executive who writes on political and social issues.

Randall, a Democrat.\Bloxom said Gillespie is ""very attentive"" to the unique problems of the Eastern Shore.\""It would be nice to have someone in the top office that you can call ... In this election, from top to bottom, the choices are pretty clear,"" he said.\Bloxom said of Northam, ""Ralph is a good friend, but he has staked out his opinions and he has stated his positions and they couldn't be more on opposites than what my friend here has said -- and that's right down the ticket.""\Citing differences between the two parties' candidates on issues including the Second Amendment, right to work laws, the environment and government regulations, Bloxom said, ""We're talking black and white ... It's very easy to look down the list and decide on the issues and pick which one you want.""\Gillespie also emphasized the distinctions between the candidates.\""The stakes couldn't be higher and the choices couldn't be more clear ... The fact is, where we are in Virginia today, we all know, is not where we need to be,"" he said.\Gillespie said Northam is ""a good guy, but he doesn't have a plan for us.""\Gillespie did not mention the recent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville or President Trump during his speech, instead focusing on the economy and other issues.\Gillespie said economic growth in the state is ""stagnant"" and has been that way for six years. Economic growth in Virginia last year was 0.6 percent, he said.\Gillespie called for policies reflecting ""conservative Constitutional principles of limited, effective government"" -- including lowering taxes, repealing mandates and ""scaling back regulations.""\""Those are the things that will unleash economic growth here in Virginia,"" he said.\Gillespie said he wants to cut individual income tax rates -- if that happens, it will be the first such cut in 45 years, he said.\""My opponent has a long record in the General Assembly of supporting tax increases,"" he said.\A tax cut would make it easier for individuals to open and operate small businesses, Gillespie said.\Gillespie also spoke in support of the state's right to work laws.\""I do not believe you should have to join a union to get a job in Virginia,"" he said.\On education, Gillespie said, ""No child in Virginia should be trapped in a failing public school. If you believe, like I do that the proper role of government is not to ensure equality of outcomes for people, but equality of opportunity for people, then you've got to make sure every child has access to a good, safe, quality school -- and my policies will do that.""\On energy, Gillespie said he does not agree with Northam, who he said supports a cap-and-trade policy on emissions and wants the state to adhere to the Paris accords.\""That will just result in more miners being laid off in our west, but also factory workers, and make it harder for us to foster advanced manufacturing,"" he said, claiming the policies also will increase electric bills.\On public safety, Gillespie said if he is elected, he will sign legislation banning ""sanctuary cities"" in Virginia. The term typically is used to describe places that limit local cooperation with federal immigration agents.\""I will sign a sanctuary city bill in a heartbeat ... We have got to keep Virginians safe in our neighborhoods, in our communities, in our businesses,"" he said.\Gillespie said the upcoming election is not just about the next four years.\""I think it's about the next 20 to 30 years ...

Climate change is significantly disrupting the ecosystem and jeopardizing countless species everyday. I shudder at the thought of going a summer without the blue crabs I've taken for granted for so many years. I care about global warming because I want to preserve the bay I grew up on for the future. \The National Climate Assessment, released in May, recognized today's impacts: ""Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,"" it said. The EPA's proposal, once finalized, will be the largest step the U.S. has ever taken to combat global warming and it's our best chance to give our children a legacy we can be proud of. \This announcement is a huge win for the health of our families and our environment. It is in large part a testament to the millions of Americans, more than 600 local elected officials and hundreds of small businesses who have already demanded cutting carbon pollution. \These standards are being continually attacked, but I hope lawmakers look to the example set by Maryland and other states that have already enacted similar cap-and-trade programs and support these historic federal limits. \Aseem Singh \Mandatory ignition interlock would save lives \Sarah Longwell and her friends at the American Beverage Institute, all lobbyists for the bar industry, claim it is just as dangerous for someone who has a .08 blood alcohol level (the legal definition of drunk driving in all states) to be driving as someone being distracted to dial on a ""hands free"" cell phone (""Ignition locks are unfair for first-time DUIs,"" June 2). Since when is justifying one dangerous and all-too-often deadly activity by claiming it is no more dangerous than another dangerous and all-too-often deadly activity acceptable to an unsuspecting public whose members are randomly killed by drunk and distracted driving every day? \The evidence proving that ignition interlock saves lives when required for all drunk drivers is overwhelming. The question for our legislators is: How many more innocent and totally random Marylanders have to die on our roads before enacting a simple measure that will keep an already convicted drunk driver from starting their car when they are drunk again? \Keith S.

107,"It seems that Baltimore is keeping pace with the rest of the country and the world: It's getting hotter. On Aug. 1, The Sun reported that July was the hottest July - actually the hottest month - ever for Baltimore. One day later, we learned that the city's 30-year average had risen half a degree above the last average.\I'm scared. I can handle a record-high temperature so long as I know that it's an exception and that it will go back down. But what is being reported here is a trend - one with no end in sight. These data are consistent with scientists' predictions of global warming.\I have a child. I want to bequeath to her a livable planet.\I've been following climate trends for decades now, and I no longer doubt that we need to do something major to counteract this trend. We need to put a price on carbon. Authorities in all walks of life are saying so: scientists (the National Academy of Sciences), religious leaders (the Vatican and others), and ultraconservative think tanks (the American Enterprise Institute), among many others.\So this month I enlisted in the nonpartisan, nonprofit, all-volunteer Citizens Climate Lobby (CCL) and agreed to join the fight for effective federal climate legislation. I believe the carbon fee and dividend legislation that CCL plans to ask Congress to take up is the best approach.\CCL's proposed legislation puts a fee on carbon as it enters the economy and then gives 100 percent of the money collected to American citizens as rebates. The fee starts at $15 per ton of carbon and rises by $10 a year for the next seven years. The effect of the fee will be to gradually make carbon-containing fuels (coal, oil and gas) and products made using those fuels more expensive, enabling alternative energy resources to compete. Meanwhile, the effect of the monthly rebates to American households would be to shield ordinary citizens from the financial stress that rising fuel prices would otherwise cause. (The scheme is completely spelled out on the CCL website, www.citizensclimatelobby.org.)\A fee is needed because the prices of fossil fuels themselves are not sending a ""market signal,"" according to economists. A huge price is paid for fossil fuel use, but only a small fraction of that price is reflected in the cost of the fuel. Society as a whole is paying this price. Included in it are subsidies taken from our taxes, health damage caused by pollution, military expenditures and deaths incurred by our addiction to oil, and the escalating ecological devastation caused by climate change. Putting a fee on carbon would correct this market failure so that the price of fuels would more accurately reflect their costs to society. CCL's experts say the system they propose could wean our economy off of fossil fuels within seven to 10 years.\The alternative energy industries are ready for this change and can quickly deploy to replace fossil fuel energy generation. Abundant new technologies are already on the shelf and need only to be scaled up to meet the nation's energy needs. CCL makes available a booklet, ""Building a Green Economy,"" providing details on these points.\A carbon fee and dividend system would be an easy sell to citizens, because of the ""green checks"" they would receive every month. Fossil fuel and other industries could adjust to fluctuating fossil fuel prices, because the increases in the fees would be predictable. The system would be welcome to the military, because climate change is a national security issue - a ""threat multiplier."" It would be acceptable to Republicans who took the ""no new revenues"" pledge, because it is revenue neutral. It is transparent, fair, and even-handed, and it would be easy to administer: the IRS could issue the checks. It would not lend itself to gambling and gaming by speculators, as cap and trade systems have.\Fee and dividend legislation would be a tremendous job creator. Analyses show that it would add many times more jobs than additional conventional power plants would do, in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance of alternative energy systems. It would benefit the environment: alternative energy resources are, for the most part, clean energy. It is supported by precedents: Germany has already shifted to carbon-based taxing and, as a result, has become a world leader in alternative energy technologies. British Columbia has introduced a system of this kind and the citizens strongly favor it.\Climate change is a nonpartisan, nondenominational, non-nationalistic issue. We can work together on it-Republicans and Democrats, people of all religious faiths, the United States and other countries. Canada's prime minister has said that if the United States introduces this system, Canada will join in. We need to do this wonderful thing and we need to do it now. Waiting can only make the climate crisis worse, more and more rapidly. Acting now can begin to build a benign new world for our children.\Dana Knighten lives in Pylesville.

Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin joined environmentalists and others at Annapolis' City Dock today to call on President Bush to stop a plan they fear will lead to more mercury-related illnesses among fish consumers.
\
The group decried a Bush administration proposal that they said would permit pollution-spewing power plants to emit more mercury for a decade longer than the federal Clean Air Act mandates.
\
""Power plants are the largest industrial source of mercury emissions in America,"" said Sarah Tomeo, a field associate with U.S. PIRG, in a written statement. ""The (Bush) administration must stop listening to its big campaign contributors in the energy industry.""
\
The U.S. Public Interest Research Group cautioned that besides endangering public health, warnings about high mercury levels in fish could harm Maryland's recreational fishing industry, which it valued at $480 million in 2001.
\
The organization claimed that one-sixth of American women of childbearing age have elevated mercury levels, exposing about 630,000 unborn babies to the neurotoxin every year.
\
Mr. Cardin, D-Baltimore, who represents a portion of Anne Arundel County, said the Environmental Protection Agency has failed to live up to its Clean Air Act mandate in regulating mercury pollution from power plants.
\
""That failure threatens the health and economic security of millions of Marylanders who ingest freshwater fish or depend on the Chesapeake Bay for their livelihood,"" he said.
\
Mr. Cardin and Ms. Tomeo were joined by representatives from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the Maryland League of Conservation Voters and the Arc of Anne Arundel County, among other organizations.
\
The controversy centers on how the federal government should police power plants such as Brandon Shores and Wagner in Anne Arundel. Such plants produce emissions that contribute to the airborne mercury that contaminates fish eaten by humans.
\
The Bush administration favors a cap-and-trade system for controlling mercury emissions.
\
According to the EPA, the system involves putting a cap on emissions and allowing individual ""sources"" - i.e., power plants - to emit a set amount of pollutants. The system has worked in cutting sulfur dioxide, a key ingredient in acid rain, the EPA reported.
\
U.S. PIRG said Mr. Bush wants to scrap Clean Air Act provisions requiring utilities to install emission-reducing technology by 2007. Instead, the president wants to give power companies another 10 years to curb mercury pollution.
\
If Mr. Bush's plan is enacted, power plants could put out three times the mercury allowed under the Clean Air Act rules, U.S. PIRG alleges.
\
Cynthia Bergman, an EPA spokesman in Washington, refuted U.S. PIRG's claims.
\
She said lawsuits have tied up efforts to regulate power plants' mercury emissions since 1992. Only now is the EPA able to act, she said.
\
""We're going to go from zero regulation to a 70 percent cut"" in emissions, Ms. Bergman said.
\
At a recent water quality conference, EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt said, ""This is a very complex issue and I want it done right.""
\
Mercury menace?
\
How much power plants contribute to mercury pollution and the extent to which mercury threatens public health are up for debate.
\
Excessive mercury levels in humans have been linked to brain damage, learning disabilities, poor memory and short attention spans. Unborn children are considered to be especially at risk.
\
Airborne mercury comes back to earth through rain and snow and is converted into methylmercury by microorganisms. Fish absorb methylmer-cury through their gills.
\
Citing mercury concerns, the Maryland Department of the Environment has issued advisories since 1999 against eating large amounts of certain types of fish caught in state waters.
\
The federal Food and Drug Administration has also warned women and young children against eating shark, swordfish, king mackerel or tilefish due to the species' high mercury levels.
\
U.S.PIRG quoted an EPA study showing that Maryland power plants emitted 1,900 pounds of mercury in 2002, 19th-most in the nation. In 1999, the EPA determined that coal-fired plants are the largest source of human-generated mercury pollution in the U.S.
\
But a year earlier, an EPA report said it was impossible to determine how much methylmercury in fish stems from power plants. Mercury pollution also comes from natural processes such as volcanic activity.
\
Even the FDA advisory on mercury-contaminated fish lauded the benefits of fish and shellfish as part of a healthy diet and encouraged the consumption of fish species with low mercury levels.
\
In a written response the advisory, the Annapolis Center for Science-Based Public Policy accused ""advocates"" of blowing the mercury threat out of proportion.
\
""This interpretation is false and misleading and could have negative consequences to the public health of Americans,"" the center's statement read.

FDA WARNING tagFactBox1 +6fu1105ps9.5ss9 While promoting fish and shellfish as part of a healthy diet, the Food and Drug Administration warns people against eating excessive amounts of mercury found in some fish. Especially vulnerable are women of childbearing age, pregnant women and children. The FDA advises them not to eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel or tilefish due to their high mercury content. Women and young children can eat 12 ounces or two meals a week of low-mercury fish, including shrimp, canned light tuna, salmon, pollock and catfish.+8

109,"If the U.S. has learned anything from the environmental movement, it's that the sooner tough choices are made to curb pollutants, the easier it is on all involved. Regulate waste disposal at Hooker Chemical three decades ago and you wouldn't have Love Canal. Pregnant women might still be able to eat freshwater fish in this country today if the nation had kept mercury, much of it coming from coal-fired power, out of the food chain decades ago.\With the climate change threat, inaction could be the greatest danger the nation faces. Act now, and the needed reductions in greenhouse gases might be achieved without a painful transition or great sacrifice. Indeed, the benefits of moving away from fossil fuels are so numerous - from new jobs and global economic competitiveness to the positive health effects and potential to offer the U.S. energy independence - that even Washington's partisan gridlock ought not be a serious impediment.\Yet, 40 years after the first Earth Day, the battle lines that divided this country on matters of the environment are still a roadblock to progress. There is simply too much money involved for the general public interest to trump big energy companies, with their lobbyists and campaign contributions. Climate change legislation requires the same sort of robust, grass-roots support that has always characterized efforts to save the planet from ecological catastrophe.\Next week, Senators John Kerry, Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman are expected to unveil their latest attempt at a bipartisan climate change bill. The measure is likely to contain some form of financial disincentive for greenhouse gas pollution similar to the cap-and-trade approach that the House of Representatives has already endorsed. In return, the legislation will probably contain elements to appease business interests, such as expanding nuclear power and gas and oil production.\It is imperative that President Barack Obama take a leadership role in this effort. The Kerry-Graham-Lieberman bill represents the best chance for overdue U.S. action on climate change and therefore the best hope for global progress on the issue.\All indications are that the White House is working behind the scenes to help build some consensus on what is a highly complex issue. Last week, Mr. Obama said he wanted it to be the next thing on the Senate's agenda after reforming how Wall Street is regulated.\Meanwhile, Congress needs to be reminded of what failure to address man-made climate change would mean for this country and the world. The most immediate consequence is that it could leave the regulation of greenhouse gases to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which is poised to make rules that the public may find far less palatable than what might emerge from Congress.\But worse, it could lead to inaction. At stake is far more than the lives of polar bears and penguins. Rising temperatures could lead to flooding, droughts, loss of farmland, increasingly violent weather events, disease, political instability and the deaths of millions of people, particularly in developing nations.\These are not the forecasts of placard-carrying doomsayers on the streets but the mainstream of climate science. The burning of fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases has so enhanced the natural greenhouse effect that changes are already in progress. Rising sea levels could consume most of the vital wetlands on Maryland's Eastern Shore within a century or less, according to a 2009 EPA report.\But even the most skeptical must concede that the U.S. can't continue its dependence on foreign sources of energy, regardless of the consequences to the planet. It is simply not sustainable, and a reliance on oil from politically unstable and often dangerous countries in the Middle East and elsewhere inevitably hurts national and world security.\Climate change is not only the greatest environmental threat of our time, it is one of our greatest opportunities to promote peace and prosperity for this country. Perhaps Earth Day 2010 will one day be remembered as a turning point in climate change policy. The bipartisan stirrings within the Senate have at least given us hope."
110,"ONLEY -- Some 100 Eastern Shore residents turned out Thursday afternoon for a candidates' forum sponsored by the Woman's Club of Accomack County held to hear from the three candidates vying to represent Virginia's 2nd District in the United States House of Representatives.\Speaking at the forum were incumbent Rep. Glenn Nye (D), who is seeking a second term; Independent candidate Kenny Golden; and Del. Brenda Pogge, who represents the 96th District in the Virginia House of Delegates and spoke on behalf of Republican candidate Scott Rigell. Rigell had another engagement and was unable to attend the forum. His wife and son were in attendance along with Pogge.\Rigell has attended several other events on the Eastern Shore during the campaign, including at events held at Captain's Cove in Greenbackville and the Sunrise Restaurant in Onley, among others.\The candidates and Pogge each had seven minutes to introduce themselves and make their case to the voters at the forum, followed by an informal meet and greet period during which individuals could speak with the candidates.\The format was a departure from past Woman's Club forums where a public question and answer session was included. The elimination of the question and answer period was done at the request of one of the campaigns, Woman's Club Legislative Chairwoman Valena Gibb said. She declined to identify which candidate made the request.\Pogge spoke first and cited her and Rigell's shared conservative principles.\Pogge said Rigell favors limited government and a return to ""what the Founding Fathers intended.""\Rigell, 50, owns Freedom Automotive in Virginia Beach, which he founded in 1991. His automobile dealerships in Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Chesapeake employ over 240 people.\He served for six years in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and earned a bachelor's degree from Mercer University and an M.B.A. from Regent University.\Pogge said the name of Rigell's business reflects his beliefs and praised his experience as a businessman and his plan to support energy independence for the United States. She also read a statement from the candidate's website, where Rigell states, ""I am running to meet the obligation we have to pass on to our children and grandchildren an America that is safe, strong, and truly free.""\Nye, 36, spoke next, reminding the crowd his grandmother was born on the Eastern Shore and citing his decade-long service as a Foreign Service Officer and State Department official with tours in Afghanistan, Iraq and Kosovo.\""Working out in the field in a tough environment we stayed focused on the mission at hand, getting the job done,"" he said, adding he has taken the same approach in Congress.\Nye said he has been an independent voice to Congress, voting against healthcare reform, opposing cap and trade legislation, and otherwise taking a stand at times against members of his own party.\Nye cited endorsements by diverse groups including the National Rifle Association, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Indepen-dent Business.\After the forum, Nye said his top priorities if reelected will be jobs and improving the economy, as well as taking care of veterans and military families.\Nye is a graduate of the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. He serves on the House Armed Services Committee and the Veterans Affairs C ommittee and is chairman of the Small Business Subcomittee on Contracting and Technology.\Independent Kenny Golden was the final speaker. ""We are at a critical point in our country,"" he said, citing his military experience as a 31-year active-duty Navy veteran, including four at-sea commands and more than four years as a congressional liaison at the Pentagon, as among his qualifications to represent the 2nd district, which includes the largest Naval port in the world.\""Forty-three percent of our livelihood is the military,"" he said of the district, pledging to make balancing the federal budget his top priority if elected.\Golden said ""jobs and the deficit"" were the top concerns of voters with whom he has spoken on the campaign trail.\Golden's platform calls for the federal budget to be balanced annually, the elimination of earmarks, a mandated 2 percent cut across the board in federal government excluding defense, and repeal of the 16th Amendment, which established the federal income tax.\Golden, who told the audience he ""was born in a log cabin on Christmas Eve outside of Richmond,"" said that together with his wife and daughter, who are also Naval officers, his family has a total of 67 years of military service.\Golden retired from the Navy in 2004. He attended Ferrum College and graduated from the University of Virginia and also earned advanced degrees from Pepperdine University and the Naval War College. He was the first U. S. Navy Hudson Fellow to St. Anthony's College at Oxford University. Golden also is a graduate of the Sorenson Institute for Political Leadership at U.Va."
111,"WASHINGTON -- As scientists and activists warned of the catastrophic effects that they said higher ocean temperatures and rising sea levels would have on the Chesapeake Bay, the governors of Maryland and Virginia called on lawmakers yesterday to formulate a federal response to global warming.\Speaking before a Senate panel yesterday, Gov. Martin O'Malley said the time has come for national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, automobiles and other sources.\""We must transition from a carbon-based economy to a green, sustainable economy,"" O'Malley told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\O'Malley joined Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, and Rep. Wayne T. Gilchrest, an Eastern Shore Republican, at a hearing devoted to the impact of climate change on the bay.\""The coastal senators are already seeing and feeling this problem,"" said Mikulski, who had asked the committee chairwoman, Barbara Boxer, to schedule the hearing.\""Our sea levels are rising, our wetlands are disappearing and our islands are underwater. We're looking at the possibility that our agriculture will be wiped out and there won't be a Baltimore harbor,"" Mikulski said.\Her comments echoed the findings of a report released in July by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation that said rising sea levels threaten hundreds of thousands of people living in low-lying coastal or river valley areas along the bay.\William C. Baker, president of the foundation, told the panel that warming oceans are likely to increase storm intensity in the bay and might expand the size and duration of oxygen-deprived ""dead zones.""\He asked lawmakers to support agricultural practices such as covering winter crops, rotational grazing and no-till farming, which a Yale study has estimated would sequester about 4.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, the equivalent of taking 786,000 Hummers of the road.\""Fossil fuels burning in Indianapolis or India, as well as a host of other greenhouse gas-producing activities, will negatively affect the people and creatures of the Chesapeake Bay just as toxics and other well-known pollutants do,"" he said.\""The policy choices you and your counterparts in other nations make will determine how severe those negative effects will be and how long they may last,"" Baker said.\Two committee members are developing legislation that would introduce a ""cap and trade"" approach to reducing emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say cause global warming.\Boxer, a California Democrat, and others expressed interest in the bill to be introduced by Republican Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia and Democratic Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, which would create a market for emissions permits that could be bought and sold.\O'Malley detailed efforts by the state to cut down on greenhouse gases, including participation in a multistate agreements to reduce emissions from power plants and plans to expand electricity from solar energy.\Maryland is among a dozen states waiting for the federal Environmental Protection Agency to approve new greenhouse gas emission standards for automobiles.\""Maryland will continue to be a leader,"" O'Malley said, but ""we need our federal government to act. State-by-state reductions simply don't make sense for this global problem, and the time is now for federal action.""\Former State Department analyst Dennis T. Avery, author of Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1500 Years, disputed the value of government intervention.\Avery said climate change is more likely the effect of a long natural cycle of cooling and warming than of any human activity.\""You are headed for enormous anguish, frustration and misspent capital in this effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" Avery told the lawmakers. ""It will not halt the temperature cycle.""\His comments echoed those of Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the senior Republican on the panel and Congress' leading skeptic about climate change caused by human activity.\Inhofe objected to Boxer's decision to allow Mikulski to join the panel for the hearing. Mikulski is not a member of the committee but is chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee that controls 85 percent of the funding for the nation's climate change science. Boxer overruled Inhofe.\Baker told the skeptics that even if global warming didn't exist, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and other strategies to counter climate change would ""make great environmental sense.""\Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, who joined Boxer and Mikulski on a recent trip to Greenland to see the impact of warming ocean temperatures, called climate change ""a threat to public safety, a threat to key bay species such as blue crabs and rockfish and a threat to the fragile lands that surround the Chesapeake.""\""Global warming threatens all of us and it's time that we work together to develop effective solutions,"" he said.\matthew.brown@baltsun.com\Credit: Sun Reporter"
112,"Thanks for the excellent article by Maddy Lauria in the Oct. 2 issue of Delaware Wave, ""Strong home market could be masking sea level rise impact.""\Not only is sea level rise/flooding impacting home prices adversely by billions of dollars from Florida to Connecticut, as mentioned in the report, but insurance rates are rising so high that this increase in rates may drive people from the shore before the sea level rise does.\At a recent forum in Lewes, a shore town mayor pointed out that a typical home paid $5,000 per year for home insurance with flood coverage a few years ago. Now it is up to $35,000-plus per year.\So it is not just those concerned about the environment who recognize the seriousness of climate change, but ""green-eye-shade"" insurance actuaries, numbers guys dispassionately looking at the facts.\It's time we all get together to stop climate change on both sides of the aisle. One good way is to use a market-based technique pioneered by President Reagan (hole in the ozone layer champion) and President Bush I (acid rain champion) that puts a price on polluting carbon fuel.\Call it cap and trade as these presidents did, or a carbon fee, as I prefer, they both put a price on pollution, so people will use less of the fuel as the price gets higher.\What to do with the fees collected is up for discussion. I prefer giving all the money back to American families as a monthly dividend check.

In the meantime, Coco was charged with offensively touching an officer. With that the ""fun"" began.\As per the video, Coco never touched any officer, so prosecutors amended the charge to offensively touching the horse. Apparently there is no such statute to violate. Later, prosecutors tried to file charges of harassment against Coco — which were rejected by the court.\In the end and with a very rare move, Judge Rosemary Beauregard dismissed the case against Coco ""with prejudice"" for prosecutors ""illegally charging"" him with touching the horse, later attempting to alter the charges and failing to release the surveillance video to Coco's attorney in a timely fashion. The ""with prejudice"" is significant as Coco's arrest will be completely expunged.\Obviously the DSP made some mistakes that May night. DSP says their Internal Affairs unit ""will investigate."" An investigation is welcome, but corrective discipline for the mistakes is what is really needed.

113," PHILADELPHIA - Environmentalists and state officials spoke out yesterday against a Bush administration proposal to curb mercury and other smokestack pollution from power plants, saying the plan doesn't go far enough to safeguard the public's health.\ The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to reduce mercury pollution from coal-burning power plants by 70 percent over the next 15 years. At hearings here, in Chicago and in North Carolina, the agency sought public reaction to its mercury plan as well as to rules that would limit releases of other power plant pollutants.\ There was little argument over EPA's plans for reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to the smog that fouls Maryland's air each summer and add to the Chesapeake Bay's woes.\ Most of the criticism was aimed at EPA's plan for reducing mercury, a highly toxic substance linked to brain damage, mental retardation in children and other health problems.\ Under EPA's proposal, power plants would be required to reduce mercury emissions from 48 tons nationwide to 15 tons by 2018. But EPA would allow power companies to avoid cleaning up certain plants by buying pollution credits from other facilities that did reduce emissions.\ ""To use an oft-quoted phrase, these caps are too little, too late,"" said Beth McGee, a senior scientist with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\ Mercury, which occurs naturally in coal, is released into the air when the fuel is burned to produce electricity. After it is emitted, it falls to the ground and enters waterways. Humans become exposed when they eat fish.\ In Maryland and several other states, officials have posted advisories warning people to limit the amount of fish they eat from certain waterways because they are contaminated with mercury.\ Power plants generate 40 percent of the nation's mercury pollution. Municipal and medical-waste incinerators, other major sources, already have their emissions regulated.\ EPA officials defended the proposal this week, arguing that a cap- and-trade plan would encourage the biggest polluters to act early and earn credits that could later be sold to other utilities. The proposal also would avoid litigation that could delay cleanup efforts for years.\ ""We're not going to have a standard that anyone's meeting if everyone is sitting in a courtroom,"" said Cynthia Bergman, an EPA spokeswoman.\ But critics say the regulations will not have their full effect for 20 years and that available technology makes it possible to accomplish more ambitious goals, reducing mercury by 90 percent much more quickly.\ ""This proposal does nothing, and that's bad science, bad economics, bad policy and bad law,"" said Peter Lehner, a lawyer with the New York attorney general's office.\ Maryland officials also oppose EPA's mercury proposal and want stricter limits on emissions from each power plant. Utilities in the state emit about 2 million tons of mercury.\ ""We do wish they'd be a little bit tougher, and a little bit quicker with compliance,"" said George ""Tad"" Aburn, air quality program manager for the state Department of the Environment. He is scheduled to testify today.\ About 50 sign-waving activists marched and chanted slogans outside the Wyndham Hotel, where the hearing was being held. One protester was dressed like a grim reaper, another like a bright green fish.\ Utility officials support the EPA proposal. They say a similar approach reduced acid-rain pollution in the 1990s and will prevent energy rate hikes that would be necessary if power plants were forced to suddenly switch from coal to natural gas.\ ""It makes more sense to predictably and reliably reduce emissions in the most cost-effective way,"" said Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, which represents utilities.\ But environmentalists argue that what reduced acid-rain pollutants might not work for mercury. Studies show that unlike sulfur dioxide and other acid-rain pollutants, certain forms of mercury don't travel far in the atmosphere, said McGee, the bay foundation scientist. The group supports trading pollution credits for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, but not for mercury.\ Dr. Michael McCally, president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, said EPA estimates show that one in six children born nationwide is at risk for developmental problems because their mothers have unsafe levels of mercury in their blood.\ Susan Gobreski of Philadelphia displayed photographs of her two daughters, ages 3 and 6, and asked EPA officials to keep them and her unborn child in mind when they enacted the mercury regulations.\ ""I have every reason to believe my baby's going to be healthy,"" said Gobreski, who says she limits her diet of fish. ""But how many other children aren't going to be so lucky?""\ Experts said that much remains unknown about mercury, but it's widely considered to be hazardous to adults as well as children.\ ""In many ways, we're still at the point in evaluating mercury as a toxic pollutant as we were in our thinking about lead some 25 years ago,"" said Ellen K. Silbergeld, a professor of environmental health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\ The hearing is scheduled to continue today. The EPA will accept written comments until March 30.\ Credit: SUN STAFF"
114,"Jay Hancock's Sunday column incorrectly reported that EDF Group Chairman and CEO Henri Proglio met with officials from Constellation Energy last week. Proglio was in Baltimore for meetings on EDF's joint project with Constellation to build a third nuclear reactor at Calvert Cliffs, but he did not meet with Constellation officials, EDF said.The Sun regrets the error.\Crisis can trash or temper a marriage. We'll soon know which way it goes for Baltimore's Constellation Energy Group and France's EDF Group.\Their partnership in owning and developing nuclear electricity plants is being tested by the terrible economy, slumping energy prices and an overdue decision from Washington on loan guarantees for a new reactor in Maryland.\There's also leftover business from almost two years ago, when EDF, parent of Electricite de France, bailed Constellation out of a mess by buying almost half its nuclear operation. As part of that rescue, it also gave Constellation an option to sell non-nuclear generation plants to EDF for up to $2 billion.\The option expires Dec. 31. Constellation doesn't need the cash nearly as badly as it did during the financial crisis. But EDF, which has better things to do with its money these days, seems increasingly concerned that Constellation boss Mayo Shattuck will pull the trigger to unload the assets.\Such a move would cause a ""breaking point"" that ""will destroy the credibility of the management"" at Constellation, EDF Chairman and CEO Henri Proglio said in a telephone interview Friday. Proglio was in Baltimore meeting with Constellation officials, presumably to try to talk Shattuck out of it or negotiate a compromise.\If the companies break up, it'll be a large setback for U.S. nuclear development and probably doom chances that a new reactor at Constellation's Calvert Cliffs plant will someday feed megawatts to an electricity-starved Maryland.\Proglio has good reason to worry that Shattuck will stick him with the aging, mainly coal-fired American electricity plants that are in the $2 billion ""put"" option.\Thanks to low energy prices, the plants are worth much less than when the companies struck their agreement. Exercising the option would give Constellation a net gain of $1 billion, calculates Paul Fremont, who follows the company's stock for Jeffries & Co. in New York.\Given Constellation's ""fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders to maximize the value of the company, it's very hard for us to see a scenario where management could justify sort of walking away from the value that's inherent in the option,"" Fremont said in an interview.\But it's not just the option that's potential grounds for divorce.\As I wrote a few weeks ago, the outlook for U.S. nuclear electricity plants has grown much dimmer. Low prices for fossil energy make nuclear electricity less competitive. So does Congress' failure to approve a tax or cap-and-trade scheme for carbon dioxide emissions.\Many investors had assumed that $100-a-barrel oil and penalties for carbon would make nuclear energy the low-cost, high-profit alternative. But the changing prospects prompted EDF to book a large charge against profits this summer to reflect the lower value of its U.S. nuclear operations.\And the Energy Department still hasn't decided whether to guarantee loans for the third nuclear reactor that Constellation and EDF have proposed to build at Calvert Cliffs, on the Chesapeake's Western Shore. Constellation expected a decision months ago.\Shattuck criticized the delay in July. Proglio, too, said he is ""frustrated.""\""This should happen quickly,"" he said. ""It's very important both for the company and the Maryland state and new nuclear in the U.S.""\He rejected suggestions that changing energy economics make the proposed Calvert Cliffs unit too risky or existing nuclear plants unattractive. ""We believe in the project,"" he said. ""We believe in our presence in this country. We believe in the efficiency of nuclear in the long term.""\Even if he's right, a rejection by the Energy Department would hurt the EDF-Constellation relationship. Another project is competing for the same loan guarantees, which are essential for financing the third Calvert Cliffs unit. Without a reactor to build with its partner, there's less reason for EDF to keep its investment either in Constellation's existing nuclear plants or in Constellation's common stock.\A Shattuck decision to exercise the $2 billion put option, forcing a far-from-flush EDF to write a big check, could lead to an irreparable breach. Proglio, who has run EDF for only about a year, may not be committed in any case. Last year the French press reported that he didn't want to consummate the investment in Constellation's nuclear business.\What will Constellation do?\""We are committed to working with EDF to resolve these issues,"" the company e-mailed in a statement. But, it added, both companies face an ""increasingly challenging economic and policy environment."" Constellation, it said, must be mindful of ""our contractual rights and obligations and the interests of our shareholders.""\The Energy Department guarantee is the fulcrum. If Washington backs a new reactor at Calvert Cliffs, Constellation and EDF may have a baby to raise, a reason to stay together and compromise on the put option. If the project dies, Shattuck has little reason not to cram the coal plants down EDF's throat.\The companies' differences will have become irreconcilable. And we all know what that means: divorce."

With Washington about to go on a spending spree of massive proportions, it's a good time to survey members of Maryland's congressional delegation and find out what's on their list for 2009.\Sen. Barbara Mikulski's goal to ""get our economy rolling again"" is no doubt shared by all. And who could argue with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer's desire to help President Barack Obama succeed in saving millions of jobs next year?\Making health care more efficient, cleaning up the environment, getting U.S. troops out of Iraq and keeping Americans from losing their homes are among the Marylanders' broad goals.\But looked at more closely, the views of Maryland's representatives suggest something else: outlines of an agenda that, under a new Democratic president, could well produce one of the most active periods of government in Washington since the Great Society of the 1960s.\The rare combination of an economic emergency and a popular new president has the potential to generate significant action on initiatives that might otherwise have gotten bogged down in D.C. gridlock.\The ideas fall into two major categories: short-term and longer. The first includes spending designed to boost economic recovery by providing the quickest stimulus - though the full impact of many projects won't be felt soon. Obama warned Friday that fixing the economy will take ""years, not months. It will get worse before it gets better.""\At the top of the list: public works programs, unsexy but effective. Upward of $200 billion will likely be spent on infrastructure projects, including building new highways and updating existing roads and bridges.\Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Baltimore says he is encouraged that Obama, the first urban president of the modern era, is sensitive to the problems of cities and has hinted that money should go to areas with the greatest need.\""Our schools are in horrible shape in the city - I'm talking about the physical structures,"" he said. Estimates call for spending at least $20 billion nationally to repair existing buildings.\Putting medical records online, at a cost of $50 billion over five years, is another likely piece of a stimulus package.\State governments will get in the neighborhood of $100 billion nationally to close the gap for Medicaid, the health care program for the poor. There is also likely to be additional direct aid to bail states out of a hole that is forcing many, including Maryland, to consider layoffs next year.\But beyond the stimulus package - which could reach $1 trillion over two years - are the initiatives that could define Obama's presidency. They would strengthen the economy over the long haul, proponents say, but might not provide an immediate boost.\Rep. Chris Van Hollen expects Obama to make a substantial new investment in early childhood education. The Montgomery County congressman calls it ""a key part of helping ensure that everyone has the ability to compete in today's economy.""\Rep. John P. Sarbanes of Baltimore and others want more money for public transportation, including short-term aid to systems like MARC, the backbone of the region's transportation system.\""The public went looking for a good public transit system when gas prices hit $4, and they discovered that there wasn't one,"" he says.\As the first president to take office with a commitment to dealing with climate change, Obama is likely to make clean energy a central focus of his administration.\Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin thinks there could finally be action on a global warming measure that would require companies to pay for the right to pollute, under a so-called cap-and-trade system.\Rep.-elect Frank Kratovil, who will represent the Eastern Shore, would like progress on wind farms, new incentives for biodiesel production and jobs programs linked to protecting the Chesapeake Bay.\Several Maryland representatives said they expect Congress to expand the state children's health insurance program during the first 100 days of the Obama administration.\That Democratic initiative, vetoed by President George W. Bush last year, would extend health coverage to millions of uninsured children.\Other ideas that have gone nowhere in the past but could be revived next year include allowing seniors between the ages of 55 and 64 to buy their way into Medicare, which provides health coverage only to those 65 and up.\Cardin and others see an opportunity to achieve universal health care, a goal that has eluded proponents for decades.\Overhauling the nation's health care system ""cannot happen through incremental change,"" said Cardin. ""It's the hardest of Obama's goals to achieve. ... Clearly a stretch, but worth fighting for.""\The battle over new spending will not only be with groups that will fight at every turn to protect their interests, but with conservative Democrats and Republicans, who may balk at increasing the national debt and could have the votes in Congress to block action.\Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, the state's last remaining Republican in Washington, emphasized savings in his wish list, which includes energy conservation, cuts in unnecessary defense spending and health reforms designed to increase individual choice.\He also wants to see more investment in energy efficiency and military research and development.\Kratovil, the most conservative Democrat in the delegation, hopes Washington doesn't go overboard in giving the economy a boost. He also wants the stimulus package to target families that are struggling to make ends meet.\The incoming freshman's focus on pocketbook concerns could warm the heart of Van Hollen, who chairs the House Democrats' campaign arm. His personal wish, he said, is that ""all the new Democratic members of Congress do everything right in 2009, so we don't have to worry about them in 2010.""\Credit: paul.west@baltsun.com"
116,"
At a time when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and President Barack Obama are calling for drastic reductions to pollution in the Chesapeake Bay, one Annapolis company thinks it has found an answer, lying under a pile of chicken poop.
\
EnergyWorks has developed a way to convert tons of animal droppings into electricity - enough to power up to 2,500 homes in a day.
\
Because environmentalists have identified nitrogen and phosphorous, two nutrients found in farm animal waste, as major hazards to the bay, technologies that aim to create agricultural solutions are in high demand.
\
Just weeks ago, EnergyWorks signed formal agreements with Hillandale Farms, the largest egg-laying chicken farm in Pennsylvania with 3.5 million birds, for the project.
\
Situated near the mouth of the Susquehanna River, the farm is in a sensitive location for the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Currently, its manure is disposed of by spreading it across thousands of acres as fertilizer. Inevitably, rain carries some of the waste into streams that feed into the bay.
\
Environmentalists say these nutrients spur the growth of algae, which suck oxygen from the water when dead, creating zones where crabs, oysters and other marine animals can't survive.
\
Beth McGhee, senior water quality scientist with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said she is heartened by the project and hopes it will springboard more solutions from the private sector.
\
""Over the last five years, we've seen many companies suggest they have a sort of silver bullet for manure-to-energy, but, for whatever reason, we haven't seen many get on the ground,"" she said. ""This project is showing that it can be done.""
\
With private equity, EnergyWorks plans to build a $30 million plant near the chicken houses that will process the manure daily. Company executives believe this facility will be the first of its kind in the United States and hope to complete the construction by early 2012, said Patrick Thompson, EnergyWorks' president and CEO.
\
The engineers will use a staged heating process to turn the manure into gas, while extracting nearly 94 percent of the nitrogen and almost 100 percent of the phosphor-ous. The process will also eliminate considerable ammonia pollution that releases into the atmosphere
\
when dung sits in stagnant, hot heaps for long periods of time.
\
""What (watershed) farmers are doing with best management practices is really important for reducing sediment runoff, but technology projects like the one we're developing will make a huge contribution for phosphorous and nitrogen pollution,"" Thompson said. ""We're measuring everything that comes into the plant and everything that comes out, and we can say with certainty how much of a difference we're making.""
\
Cap-and-trade
\
If EnergyWorks' program proves successful, not only will the environment benefit, but the business will be able to capitalize on a nutrient-trading program in Pennsylvania, one of several recently started or under development in the region, including one in Maryland. The programs offer a market-based approach to improving water quality.
\
States establish a total amount of allowable pollution in a specific area. Registered businesses can earn credits by reducing their pollution below the maximum allowed. They can then trade the credits with other businesses for whom it would be more costly to make the same pollution reductions.
\
With Maryland developing its own nutrient-trading system, it is EnergyWorks' hope that it may soon be gasifying manure at farms on the Eastern Shore.
\
A new state law took effect June 1 that has empowered the Maryland Department of Agriculture to establish nutrient credits for state agriculture.
\
John Rhoderick, the department's Resource Conservation Operations administrator, said the state program's online trading tools are already up and running, at www.md.nutrienttrading.org, and 126 people have already undergone training to use the resources.
\
Right now, only one business has made it into the processing phase to receive credits. But Rhoderick said they're getting positive feedback, and there are signs the number of participants will grow.
\
""Based on what we've seen from the (pollution reduction) plans from Maryland and other states, trading is going to take on a very increased role going forward by providing these offsets,"" he said.
\
Nutrient-trading may even expand beyond the state's boundaries. U.S. Sen. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Baltimore, are working on a national bill that would establish interstate trading within the Chesapeake Bay region.
\
Closing the nutrient cycle
\
Thompson said his company's new program is not just about renewable energy but sustainability. A by-product of the manure heating process is an ash that is so refined, EnergyWorks anticipates receiving a federal certification to label it a food-grade substance, meaning it could be used as an animal feed supplement.
\
""In other words, we're sending it back where it came from, which has always been my goal,"" Thompson said. ""We're trying to close the nutrient cycle.""
\
Many chicken farms exist on the Eastern Shore, where agricultural pollution is also a major concern for the Chesapeake Bay. Though those plants are predominantly broiler chickens as opposed to egg layers, Thompson said his company is eager to work on modifying their plant designs to accommodate their diverse needs.
\
And the company isn't going to limit its prospects to just chickens - even cattle and swine manure will work.
\
""We've been in touch with farms in Maryland and are very anxious to bring them these solutions,"" he said. ""It's definitely feasible.""

Thank you
\
On behalf of the Anne Arundel County Community Action Agency, I would like to thank County Executive John R. Leopold and the County Council for fully funding our operating grant for 2011.
\
During these very tough economic times, our agency is seeing an increase in the amount of Anne Arundel County families needing our services. Due to the reinstatement of funding, we will be able to continue serving clients in west and north county at our new site in Glen Burnie.
\
We appreciate all the people in the county who sent postcards, letters and e-mails to their council representatives supporting full funding for our organization.

Whenever I read about the Arundel Mills casino case, I get more and more irate. I wonder, is it my signature Cordish wants thrown out?

When slots were legalized we were told they would be at appropriate sites - specifically Laurel Park. We were told this was the only way to save Maryland racing.
\
When the zoning board and County Council override what was promised to the citizens of Anne Arundel County, what could be more democratic than to petition for a referendum?

Crofton LED's
\
With all the dire environmental predictions about the effects of global warming, the bent of the planet-friendly politicians seems to propose new taxes and rising energy prices for us consumers, who seem somehow to be the cause of the pollution blamed for the mess.
\
Personally, I've never quite grasped how new taxes, the ballyhooed solution favored by the green crowd, are going to save our planet, even though I do grasp that we as a nation consume enormous kilowatt-hours of energy adding to the entropic waste that's degrading our environment.
\
Fortunately, technology is providing means to reduce by about three-fourths much of the wasted energy. A light-emitting-diode (LED) bulb consumes but about a quarter of the energy of an incandescent bulb while producing comparable light, and LED's not only reduce the heat-loss, but also last for years instead of months.
\
Manufacturing costs, which are considerable but not unreasonable, will come down with increased usage. It shouldn't take a genius to convince politicians to forget cap and trade taxes and put emphasis on further LED development.

Annapolis Setting record straight
\
Recently you published a letter (The Capital, May 22) from former Housing Authority for the City of Annapolis Board of Commissioners' chair Trudy McFall. It is only fair that your readers consider another view. Therefore, I believe it is important to set the record straight.
\
I served with McFall during her tenure as chair. McFall attempted to keep those commissioners (including me) who disagreed with her in the dark. She often spun a story that did not reflect what the facts were.
\
Here are the facts. The resignation of Eric C. Brown was requested by six of the seven commissioners. The seventh commissioner was ill and did not attend the meeting.
\
Newly appointed Commissioner Jeffrey C. Henderson was not the deciding factor. The decision to request Brown's resignation was unanimous among those present. This included both supporters and opponents of Brown. McFall's outlandish claim that we are moving toward a return to patronage isn't even worth responding to.
\
Also, regarding former Annapolis police Chief Joseph S. Johnson - a native of Annapolis who served the citizens of our city, county, state and nation for more than 50 years, as a member of the armed forces and as a police officer - he does not need his reputation validated by a former mayoral candidate who was defeated at the polls. McFall did not support Mayor Josh Cohen, which was her right. However, the election is over and she lost.
\
McFall and those of her ilk can keep their sour grapes views to themselves. I would recommend that McFall remember that elections have consequences and one of the consequences for her is that she is not in charge.

Vice Chair, HACA board Sowell column
\
In regards to Thomas Sowell's column (The Capital, May 14), the notion of ""duty to die"" would indeed be repulsive if there were any substance to it. Also repulsive is the notion that Sowell apparently is willing to spread such rumor without providing any factual source or proper context.
\
He does not identify even one person or organization that claims to espouse the idea that elderly people should die in order to save the nation money; he merely lays blame at the doorstep of the ""intelligentsia,"" a vague and broadly defined term that imparts little understanding.
\
I have worked for a hospice (which specializes in helping people approach end-of-life situations with dignity and comfort) for several years, and have never heard the ""duty to die"" concept mentioned.
\
According to Sowell, the British government-run health system is restricting some medicines and treatments for the elderly. He did not mention that some medications do not have the same efficacy for older individuals as for the general population, and some treatments that a more robust person could withstand would be devastating to a person already weakened by a host of ""old age"" conditions.
\
Under these conditions it may be quite appropriate to manage which therapies apply to which people. Sowell does not give us any factual context to decide the merits of his argument.
\
Moreover, his anecdotes about Aunt Nancy Ann and the Harvard lawyer who advised him, for career considerations, not to seek custody of his son are irrelevant to the topic of his column. He does a great disservice by pursuing such emotionally charged innuendo if he is unable or unwilling to back it up with facts.

Fly ash and smart meters
\
BGE wants to dump its fly ash into an old 65-acre clay mine in southern Baltimore very near the Fott Smallwood Road area of northeast Anne Arundel County. Fly ash is a major residue from burning coal to generate electricity.
\
This is an old story in Anne Arundel. Talk to Fort Smallwood Road residents about air pollution from the Solley Road fly ash mountain and to north Crofton residents about ground water contamination from the Gambrills fly ash pit. Find out about all the lead and arsenic.
\
Also talk to these people about what a great watchdog we have in the Maryland Department of the Environment. Will MDE require a pit liner that won't leak flym ash? BGE boasts that it recycles 60 percent of its fly ash; maybe MDE could make it recycle 100 percent.
\
At the same time, BGE is trying to get the Public Service Commission to approve ""smart"" meters. These new meters not only would put meter readers out of a job, but also would let BGE charge people half again for power they use at ""peak"" times - a very hot day in summer, a very cold day in winter - when they most need power.
\
BGE is sugar-coating the smart meters, of course, just as it sugar-coated deregulation back in 1999. It also seeks quick approval from PSC, before people start smelling the rat.
\
In 2010, politicians will try to evade these two BGE issues. Don't let them. If you're not happy with their answers, don't vote for them. They can control BGE if they want to.

Transparency
\
Recently, the Senate Finance committee, comprised of 13 Democrats and 10 Republicans, voted, 12 to 11, not to display the entire health care initiative on the Internet for Americans to read before they vote on the bill.
\
What secret are they trying to hide? Why are they attempting to keep Americans from having the opportunity to see the entire bill? Is this the ""transparency"" that we were guaranteed by Mr. Obama? Are they going to read the bill to discover what it contains before they vote? Is this a democracy or a dictatorship?

Please stop the party politics. The truth will surface.

Obama change
\
David Harper, in his letter (The Capital, Sept. 26) questioned several of my assertions regarding Barack Obama's administration and the Democratic controlled congress. I would like to set the record straight and I thank The Capital for printing this. Facts can be stubborn things.
\
Mr. Harper asked for evidence that the House's bill on cap and trade would cause electricity costs to rise dramatically. In addition to having a negligible effect upon carbon emissions, the fact is that Obama himself stated that electricity costs would ""skyrocket.""
\
Mr. Harper doesn't believe that the CBO has projected trillions of dollars in borrowing over the next decade. The fact is that in August 2009, The New York Times, along with other major newspapers, reported that both the CBO and the White House agree that deficits through 2019 are expected to exceed $9 trillion.
\
Mr. Harper claims that there is no bill addressing a health care overhaul. The fact is the H.R. 3200 was introduced on July 14. He may want to pay particular attention to Section 164, which addresses a $10 billion subsidy for union pensions.
\
My reference to czars in the White House is part of a broader notion that we are known by the company we keep. The fact is that several are self-avowed leftists. Moreover, Obama has a long-standing relationship with a pastor, Jeremiah Wright, who has asked God to damn America and a '60s radical, William Ayers, who has actually bombed America.
\
Like Mr. Harper, I am a veteran and I happened to work at NSA. We both love our country and I applaud his service. Yet, I am fearful that the path we are now following is terribly wrong for America.

Civility and our past
\
On TV, the U.S. Senate historian recently discussed 1856 violence in the U.S. Capitol. A northern Senator gave a speech about slavery's immorality, relating to Kansas being a slave or free state. A Rep. Brooks from South Carolina - a slave state - was incensed and beat the northern Senator senseless on the U.S. Senate floor. The historian called this the trigger event ending civil disclosure about slavery, and led directly to the Civil War.
\
In Towson recently, a senator was loudly shouted down during a health care forum. An old woman said to me, ""This reminds me of 1938 and Kristallnacht - the 'night of the broken glass,' when mobs of Germans rampaged through German cities smashing the windows of Jewish homes and shops."" It heralded the beginning of World War II in Europe, and the extermination of the Jews. Germany, which had given the world some of its greatest musicians and scientists, became the scourge of humanity. Fifty million died, including 6 million of Jesus' own people.
\
Out west, a man went to a health care forum that the president attended, carrying an assault rifle. This wasn't about second amendment rights. It was a call for mass murder versus political discourse, to resolve the health care bills. And a news broadcast revealed he's connected to a group that encouraged Timothy McVeigh's bombing of the Oklahoma federal building in 1995 and disgracing everything Jesus' life stood for as a message for all of humanity. His pastor called for the extermination of another minority group of Americans.
\
Wherever you stand on the complex issues of health care we all must realize extremists want to replace political discussion with violence. This isn't America, and we must be ever vigilant in understanding the lessons of our past.

119,"The main purpose of most politicians is to stay in power. To do this they need to give their constituents what they want. This takes money. To get money, they need to enact taxes, fees, permits, tolls and licenses, much of which is legalized theft.\I have a sheet of legal-size paper full of the various taxes we pay. What is not on that list is the ""cap and trade"" tax we pay in this state.\This tax is ridiculously justified by the alarmist notion that we are warming the planet by burning fuels that give off the now ""toxic"" gas carbon dioxide, as just decreed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We are paying an extra tax on all forms of fuel in Maryland. This adds to the business-unfriendly environment the governor and liberal legislators have made.\Businesses would flock to this state if taxes were low and oppressive legislation was eliminated. Worcester County is paying Baltimore City 18 percent off the top of its casino profits. Why? Now Gov. O'Malley is proposing giving in-state tuition costs to illegal immigrants, an $8 toll on the Bay Bridge and higher tolls in other areas.\Americans for Prosperity, a tea party organization, fought and defeated the 10-cent per gallon tax at the pump. Imagine the mean-spiritedness of these politicians wanting to add substantially to the already outrageous cost of gasoline and diesel fuel, after defeating the fabulously lucrative natural gas drilling in western Maryland.\This single endeavor would decrease our taxes and put thousands to work. Pennsylvania has been doing it in the same Marcellus shale formation since 2003. What have we been doing? But we have the first state department of education about to mandate an environmental curriculum for high school graduates.\Why can Florida function with no state income tax? Why did Texas create 265,000 jobs when the rest of the country created 266,000? Is it because of conservative leadership making those states friendly to business?\Texas has no state income tax or capitol gains taxes. It will not enforce the federal mandate for curly mercury bulbs. It drills for oil and natural gas. Texas is about to enact a law stating that the loser in a lawsuit will pay the defendant's expenses. Could Maryland ever rise to that level?\Dennis W. Evans\Berlin\Obama's had some successes\During a Republican presidential candidates debate, Ron Paul was asked if he could name one thing President Obama has accomplished. Paul answered that was a tough question. Oh, really?\Let's start with saving the car industry. Economists estimate that between 1 million and 2 million jobs were saved by refusing to let Chrysler and General Motors go under. Both car companies are back on their feet, have paid back the loans and are hiring.\Passing the Affordable Care Act was a huge accomplishment. 40,000 people die unnecessarily each year for lack of health insurance. Under the health care law, this will change as the law is fully implemented.\How about bringing justice to our country for Sept. 11? Osama bin Laden was still plotting to kill Americans when he was killed by our Navy SEALs as a result of a gutsy decision by President Obama.\The stimulus created more jobs in 2010 than President Bush did in eight years. Republicans refused to acknowledge that, because most did not support it. Many did, however, have their pictures taken in their local district as jobs were created so they could get credit for President Obama's success.\Tom Wallace\Ocean Pines\Bozman's work noted by colleagues\The recent passing of John Bozman signals the end of an era in community journalism in Salisbury and environs.\Susan Canfora's tribute (""John Bozman: Above the fold,"" July 13) and his obituary touched on the many fine qualities he brought to The Daily Times and its affiliate publications.\As strange as it may sound, he started in the business when ""cut-and-paste"" meant exactly that -- taking a pair of scissors to a typewritten story and rearranging the order of paragraphs with glue before it went to a typesetter.\When word processors were introduced in the newsroom in the 1980s, John embraced the equipment as a tool that would make him a better journalist and The Times a better newspaper.\Unlike the younger journalists he enthusiastically mentored, John didn't go to college to study the craft. He came by his word-smithing talents naturally. He was a voracious reader with an innate sense of curiosity who loved talking (and listening) to folks.\He worked long hours, ignoring the clock to make sure he had polished his prose or that of a fellow reporter just so. His work ethic and commitment to the profession -- making that extra phone call to get the penultimate fact or quote -- went unnoticed by The Times readers but not those of us who were honored to work alongside him.\Bill Robinson\Salisbury\GOP puts itself in harm's way\I'm concerned about the impasse in Washington, but also for the Republican Party and for the predictable -- and unpredictable -- economic and social consequences if the country defaults.\The country has an interest in a viable, responsible two-party system.\I want Rep. Andy Harris to succeed in helping to make the country a better place. But I genuinely, really do feel congressional conservatives are following Grover Norquist, Rush Limbaugh and Tea Party pied pipers off a steep cliff.\Please recall the deeply negative public reaction already to Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal.\If the debt ceiling is not raised and if the Republicans' Norquistian refusal to compromise on revenue enhancements comes to be perceived as the precipitating cause of ensuing economic distress, public anger will torpedo the GOP.\Some revenue enhancements, especially closing egregious tax loopholes (not excluding the mortgage interest deduction), are essential to getting the budget back on to a credible glidepath toward balance.\The revenue increases should not go into effect immediately, in order to let the economy recover further. But they should be scheduled to phase in during the proximate future, thereby making it believable that we are serious about getting the budget back under control.\D.

120,"Anxious about soaring electricity costs, a Senate committee voted to give households a break on monthly bills by using money that had been set aside by Gov. Martin O'Malley for energy efficiency and conservation.\The proposal would provide a credit estimated at $5 a month to help consumers cope with double-digit increases in electricity rates. O'Malley, a Democrat, has pledged to address rising rates and Maryland's energy crunch, but lawmakers said yesterday that he hasn't done enough to help consumers.\""We've promised them rate relief, but we've given them no relief,"" said Sen. E.J. Pipkin, an Eastern Shore Republican who proposed the rate credits.\The Senate Finance Committee approved the plan as part of the O'Malley administration bill that creates the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which would pay for conservation, renewable energy programs and climate change research. It would be funded in part by the state's cap-and-trade system intended to reduce greenhouse gases, established through a multistate agreement that O'Malley signed in 2007. By some estimates, that system could generate $140 million annually.\But environmentalists objected to the proposal, saying the money should go to help consumers lower energy consumption - and their bills - over the long term through rebates for energy efficient appliances, home weatherization and other measures. Brad Heavner, state director for Environment Maryland, called the proposal a ""short-term political payoff that cheats consumers.""\Johanna Neumann, state director of the Maryland Public Interest Research Group said the proposal shows that lawmakers are ""out of touch with consumers"" and noted that studies have shown that every dollar invested in energy efficiency results in $4 in savings.\""You can't even go to the movies for that amount of money,"" she said of the proposed credit. ""And people's bills have gone up hundreds of dollars.""\The proposal faces some resistance in the House of Delegates, and senators could still amend the legislation before sending it to the full Senate for a vote.\Del. Dereck E. Davis, chairman of the Economic Matters Committee, said his panel would consider ratepayer relief but that he would like to focus on bolstering a program that helps low-income residents pay their bills, especially as an economic downturn pinches more of their household budgets. The Senate panel would direct some money to that program.\Davis said any relief would have to be ""meaningful"" and that conservation and efficiency programs should be funded. ""We have to redo our whole way of living as it relates to electricity,"" he said. ""Things aren't like they used to be. We don't have an unlimited supply of electricity.""\Malcolm D. Woolf, director of the Maryland Energy Administration, said that not funding conservation and efficiency programs would be ""a missed opportunity."" He said those programs would save consumers more over time than the monthly credits. By comparison, he said, residents in California, where such programs have been in place for years, now use 42 percent less energy per capita than Marylanders.\The amount of any consumer credit in Maryland would depend on the success of the regional greenhouse gas initiative, which requires utilities to buy ""allowances"" for emissions from fossil-fuel plants. Estimates for the money raised by auctioning those emission rights have ranged from $80 million to $260 million a year. The first auction is scheduled for September.\The General Assembly is considering a number of administration bills this year aimed at increasing reliance on conservation as well as on renewable energy in an effort to stave off rolling blackouts, which state officials predict could come by 2011 without some intervention.\Another bill approved yesterday by the Senate Finance Committee would more than double, to 20 percent by 2022, the amount of renewable energy that Maryland utilities must purchase for sale to their customers. The panel delayed implementation of the bill by two years.\Money raised from compliance fees through that bill would be directed to the same energy investment as the emission auction proceeds.\The panel also approved legislation that aims to reduce energy consumption in the state 15 percent by 2015 by requiring utilities to offer consumers financial incentives to conserve. When the state deregulated the energy industry in 1999, programs that reduced consumer demand or promoted conservation became less prevalent because companies have less incentive to reduce consumption.\Lawmakers also have introduced a bill to limit certain costs that are passed on to BGE's customers, potentially saving them more than $1.4 billion in the coming decades. It would grant the Public Service Commission more oversight of those funds, which are collected to pay for the eventual dismantling of the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant. That bill has not yet received a committee vote.\Sen. Thomas M. Middleton, chairman of the Finance Committee, said lawmakers are holding off on that legislation while negotiations are under way between the Maryland attorney general's office and Constellation Energy Group, parent company of BGE. The two sides recently filed dueling lawsuits over credits that the legislature forced the company to give consumers in 2006 as part of a response to impending rate increases.\Middleton predicted that the legislature will ultimately approve the bill, though he said its final form would depend on the success of the negotiations. With less than two weeks left in the legislative session, Middleton said he hoped the two sides could reach a settlement. He said that the state needs Constellation as a partner in solving the state's energy needs.\laura.smitherman@baltsun.com\Sun reporter Timothy B.

121,"The Maryland Senate voted down a major piece of Gov. Martin O'Malley's environmental agenda yesterday amid a squabble among Democrats over how much money should be dedicated to rate relief for consumers coping with rising utility bills.\The Senate voted 25-21 to reject the bill setting out how money from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative would be used. Lawmakers say the initiative could generate about $140 million every year through fees on industry, which will have to buy pollution credits through auctions beginning this year, but some estimates put the figure much higher.\O'Malley, a Democrat who made energy policy a cornerstone of his agenda, had proposed using at least some of the money for energy efficiency and conservation programs to help reach his goal of reducing energy consumption in the state by 15 percent over the next seven years. The vote does not negate the new cap-and-trade system, but it puts in flux how the proceeds would be spent.\The unexpected defeat reflected how anxious lawmakers are about the effect of soaring energy prices on constituents and left the administration scrambling to resurrect the proposal, which proponents say would help consumers in the long run.\""The governor hopes that the Senate will reconsider the legislation in the coming days,"" said O'Malley spokesman Rick Abbruzzese. ""It's important legislation that will allow us to invest in our energy future and at the same time provide some additional relief to Maryland families.""\Sen. Thomas ""Mac"" Middleton, chairman of the Finance Committee, said he planned to ask the Senate to reconsider the vote today. If that procedural move doesn't work, he said the House of Delegates also is considering the bill, and that he could try to move their version through his chamber.\""It's the governor's bill, and it's very important to him, and as a committee chairman, I certainly don't want to lose a bill on the floor,"" the Charles County Democrat said. ""There's a lot of dynamics here, and these are very complex bills.""\Deciding how to divide the proceeds has proved particularly thorny. Some lawmakers want more money for programs that would help consumers save energy through incentives to use new, efficient appliances and other technologies. Other lawmakers argue that much more of the money should be returned to consumers in the form of rebates.\The Finance Committee initially voted in favor of a proposal that would have yielded $5 monthly credits on residential electric bills. But the panel reversed course last week and reduced the rebates to about $1.80 a month, leaving the rest for energy efficiency programs, assistance for low-income ratepayers and other initiatives. That formula was endorsed by the O'Malley administration.\During a late-night session Monday, senators tried but failed to change that formula. Sen. Joan Carter Conway, the Baltimore Democrat and chairwoman of the Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee, wanted to boost the amount dedicated to help lower-income residents pay utility bills and to direct the rest to efficiency and conservation. Sen. E.J. Pipkin, an Eastern Shore Republican who is influential on energy issues, wanted to give all of the auction funds back to utility customers.\Some lawmakers and environmentalists say that an across-the-board rebate to more than 2 million households would amount to a couple of dollars and do little to reduce utility bills that run into the hundreds of dollars. They also say that efficiency and conservation saves consumers more money over time.\Separately, the legislature is considering a settlement brokered by the state with Constellation Energy Group that would include rebates for Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. customers.\Environment Maryland director Brad Heavner said that funding conservation programs ensures that the greenhouse gas initiative achieves its goal of reducing pollution. ""If we don't spend this money in the right way, that effort will have failed,"" he said.\But with residents pinched by a slowing economy and higher energy prices, many Democrats were conflicted. Sen. Nathaniel J. McFadden, the president pro tem from Baltimore, said the idea of spending on energy efficiency would be hard to explain to consumers right now.\""Our consumers are screaming about the costs to their families,"" McFadden said. ""They want R-O-L-A-I-D-S ... relief.""\Pipkin decried the ""boondoggle bill"" that creates ""a very expensive empire"" for the Maryland Energy Administration, which would create the efficiency and conservation programs.\""The money should have been returned to ratepayers,"" he said.\Republicans said that a package of bills proposed by O'Malley would increase the cost of electricity in Maryland at a time when rates are soaring. The other bills would require power companies to buy more renewable energy and would establish the governor's goal for reducing energy consumption while requiring utilities to offer consumers financial incentives to conserve.\""We're hitting them three times in one morning,"" said Sen. Allan H. Kittleman, the minority whip from Howard County.\The state Senate passed the other administration bills yesterday with comfortable margins.\The debate over the auction proceeds exposed a quarrel between the two Senate committees that considered the bill. Conway demanded that her committee be removed from the bill because the changes endorsed by the panel were not ultimately adopted. Her motion was rejected on procedural grounds.\Immediately afterward, Sen. Delores G. Kelley, a Baltimore County Democrat, stood and said: ""Colleagues, this is a good bill.""\""Yeah, right,"" Conway muttered audibly in response.\The House put off voting on its version of the legislation yesterday, though members began debate and aired similar concerns to those heard in the Senate.\""It's a lovely piece of legislation in theory. Everybody is for a greener world,"" said Del. Patrick L. McDonough, a Republican representing Baltimore and Harford counties. ""But it does not impact consumer rates in any way except for costing them more money.""\That chamber has hashed out its own formula for dividing the auction proceeds.\laura.smitherman@baltsun.com\gadi.dechter@baltsun.com\Credit: SUN REPORTERS"

O'Malley re-election
\
The front page (The Sunday Capital, July 5) ""news"" about Gov. O'Malley is one of the most egregious examples of media bias I have ever seen.
\
The Capital interviewed O'Malley, thus making up its own ""news."" It then cast the result as news by giving it a Sunday above-the-fold front-page position and headline as if something newsworthy had happened and needed to be conveyed to the public.
\
The only news in this item was The Capital's adulation of O'Malley. Using the governor's own self-serving words, it cast him as a brave warrior against economic woes and blatantly listed what it referred to as ""many achievements"" - a list of achievements that turned out to be short indeed. Unpopular actions were attributed to ""Maryland,"" not O'Malley.

Panhandling bill
\
Let's give credit where credit is due - state legislation banning panhandling in the county was due to the tireless efforts of: Dels. Joseline Pe<0x00F1>a-Melnyk, D-District 21, and Pamela Beidle, D-District 32.
\
Pe<0x00F1>a-Melnyk actually campaigned on this issue in 2006 because Anne Arundel voters told her they were frustrated and fearful that the panhandlers frequenting busy intersections along Route 198 were distracting drivers and creating a serious public safety problem. The bill to ban roadside solicitation, as it was officially known, was the first piece of legislation Pe<0x00F1>a-Melnyk introduced following her election.
\
She met resistance at every turn - from the charitable organizations that argued it would hurt their fundraising to the free speech advocates who said it would infringe on people's First Amendment rights. The delegation did not support it initially, and it faced an uphill battle in the House Environmental Matters Committee. Beidle's support and hard work was pivotal to getting the bill through that committee and she and Pe<0x00F1>a-Melnyk continued to shepherd it through the legislative process in the House and then worked with Sen. Jim Rosapepe, D-District 21, to win passage in the Senate.
\
John Leopold, who by then was county executive, was supportive of the legislation, but he had a very limited role in getting it through the General Assembly. The ban on roadside solicitation in Anne Arundel has been successful, and made state roadways safer for everyone; on that much we can agree. But let's give the credit to those who worked to make the law possible - the residents of Anne Arundel who saw a problem and insisted it be addressed, and to Pe<0x00F1>a-Melnyk and Beidle who did the heavy lifting to get it passed, not John Leopold.

Cap and trade
\
To all of those who see the ""Cap & Trade"" bill as a job creator, energy saver, environmentally sound piece of legislation, I have but one question for you: How could you possibly know? This bill is almost 1,300 pages. The last 300 pages were submitted at 4 a.m. on the day of the House vote.
\
When the House Minority Leader, John Boehner, asked to see the 300-page addition, he was denied access. Doesn't that tell you something? Could there possibly be something in the bill that the framers did not want everyone to see? If this bill is going to be so great why was a 98-page report from an employee of the EPA disputing global warming suppressed? Why is it that every day more and more reputable scientists are disputing man made global warming? These scientists include Freman Dyson and S. Fred Singer. (If you don't know who these men are, I suggest you Google them. Their credentials are beyond dispute.)
\
Wake up, people. This bill is the biggest power grab ever tried by the federal government. If passed, kiss your personal freedoms goodbye. The government will control most of your life including your energy use right down to the length of your showers.
\
And, by the way, speaking of power grabs, the Obama administration is right now quietly investigating the repeal of the 22nd amendment. You know, the one limiting the president to two terms. Can you say, ""All hail Obama?""

Republican Women of Anne Arundel County:
\
Thank you for removing the despicable article on your Web site that compared our president, Barack Obama, to the most hated man in history, Adolph Hitler.
\
As you can well imagine, when hearing about this article on the national evening news, many women in our area, regardless of party affiliation, were deeply distressed.
\
People unfamiliar with our county could have, at best, thought that the women of Anne Arundel County are devoid of understanding about the political process. At worse, the audience might have deduced that we harbor small-minded citizens who are consumed with hate and not accustomed to rational discussion.
\
I see that the writer of the article is your president, Joyce Thomann. Unfortunately, her confrontational style of writing continues further on your Web sit with her solution for the improvement of our environment:
\
""I have figured out a way to get to that massive 90 percent reduction within less than a day. Here's my solution to the so-called greenhouse gas problem. First, let's acknowledge there are more registered Democrats in Maryland than Republicans. Second, everyone who breathes out emits carbon dioxide. Voila! All the Democrats in Maryland must stop breathing and we are there.""
\
It might be helpful if Ms. Thomann and the membership of her club would re-examine the first basic principle espoused by Republicans:
\
""I believe the strength of our nation lies with the individual and that each person's dignity, freedom, ability and responsibility must be honored.""
\
It would be well if they could resolve to honor each person's freedom and dignity - even Democrats, and especially the president of our great country.

126,"
The federal government promised on Thursday to take a more active role in cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay, vowing to crack down on states in the watershed if they miss the mark on pollution reductions.
\
Lisa P. Jackson, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said she'll block permits or yank federal funding as punishment, if necessary.
\
""It's a challenge that has persisted more than two decades and one that has seen a lot of study and strategy, but not nearly enough action,"" Jackson said in a conference call with reporters Thursday afternoon.
\
She said that restoring the bay is ""one of our nation's most significant challenges.""
\
The EPA's promises came as several federal agencies issued reports outlining new ideas for doing a better job of restoring the health of the nation's largest estuary. The reports were responses to an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in May.
\
And while environmentalists lauded the reports as a step in the right direction, they cautioned that only time will tell if these promises are kept - or if they'll be broken, as other pledges made over the years have been.
\
""If all these things that were announced today can come to pass, it will have a very positive impact on the bay,"" said Doug Siglin, federal lobbyist for the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
\
But he warned: ""It's a big 'if.' I think today's reports indicate a lot of good intentions, but there's a lot of steps in between announcing intentions and getting it done.""
\
The key report came from the EPA, which has ultimate authority over water quality under the federal Clean Water Act.
\
The EPA promised to speed up its development of a ""pollution budget,"" which will specify how much nutrient and sediment pollution the bay can safely absorb.
\
Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus flow into the bay from sewage plants, septic systems, farms, urban and suburban stormwater runoff and air pollution. They fuel the growth of algae blooms, which ultimately suck life-sustaining oxygen from the water.
\
Sediment also reaches the bay in stormwater runoff, clouding the water and smothering grasses and oysters.
\
Once EPA sets the pollution budget, by the end of 2010, states will further divvy up the amounts among rivers and will be responsible for crafting plans to meet the targets.
\
If the states fail, the EPA may step in with sanctions, including yanking federal grants, blocking water discharge permits and halting new sources of pollution, such as construction of subdivisions.
\
Jackson said blocking permits isn't the preferred course of action. But she said she won't hesitate to do it if necessary.
\
Other ideas offered by federal agencies Thursday included:
\
Expanding the number of factory farms, called ""confined animal feeding operations,"" that need to have permits.
\
Expanding the scope of federal stormwater discharge permits, which counties and towns must obtain, to include goals for water quality.
\
Ensuring that new and expanding pollution sources are offset by reductions elsewhere.
\
Targeting grant money more efficiently to areas where the environmental need is greatest.
\
Keeping a close watch on sewage plant upgrades to make sure the major plants remain on schedule for pollution-reducing technology.
\
The reports will be consolidated into a more formal proposal by Nov. 9 and finalized by May 12, exactly one year after the president's executive order.
\
If the plans are carried out, Jackson said the bay should be clean enough by 2025 to be removed from the list of the nation's ""impaired waters."" The bay was supposed to be off the list by 2010, but officials acknowledge that won't happen.
\
Carrots and sticks
\
For years, bay advocates have decried the federal government's lack of serious action on restoring the Chesapeake Bay.
\
They've lamented that there have been no consequences for missing the various cleanup goals that have been set again and again over the years. Up to this point, pollution reductions were voluntary.
\
The EPA promise to enforce pollution limits was good news that has been a long time coming, said Tommy Landers, policy advocate for Environment Maryland, a nonprofit group.
\
""After 25 years of approaches of all carrots and no sticks, we're finally getting to see sticks here,"" Landers said.
\
But, like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation representative, he noted that the enforcement plan is just a proposal at this point.
\
""It really could be a game-changing thing for the bay if it's done right. The devil is going to be in the details,"" he said.
\
Author Howard Ernst, who is often critical of bay restoration efforts, was not impressed with the feds' ideas.
\
""The more things change, the more they stay the same,"" he said.
\
Ernst noted that states will be held accountable for reducing pollution, but there's very little in the reports to help them crack down on farms, which are the top source of bay pollution.
\
Ernst, who teaches political science at the Naval Academy, also said that while the promises of better enforcement are good, the EPA is rather late in coming to the idea. He hopes the EPA will now follow through, but isn't holding his breath.
\
""If previous actions are an indicator of future behavior, there's little reason to think they'll come through on this promise,"" he said.
\
Another vision
\
Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md., this week offered up his own vision for bay restoration.
\
His Chesapeake Bay Ecosystem Restoration Act of 2009 would set a new deadline of 2020 for getting the bay off the impaired waters list.
\
He'd like to see the federal government completely step in if states fall short on their pollution-reduction plans.
\
Cardin's bill also puts $1.5 billion into controlling stormwater runoff, the only source of pollution that's growing. And it sets up a trading program for nutrient pollution - similar to the national cap-and-trade program that Congress is now considering as a way to limit carbon dioxide emissions and combat global warming.
\
The bill also hits on some other hot topics: banning the commercial fishing of menhaden, putting into law the decision not to put ""Asian"" oysters in the bay, and boosting efforts to remove nutria from the Delmarva Peninsula.
\
Jackson from the EPA said her staff will work with Cardin so that the efforts are ""complementary.""
\
WAYS TO IMPROVE THE BAY
\
Federal agencies unveiled ideas for improving the Chesapeake Bay restoration effort, including:
\
Developing a ""pollution budget"" for the bay by the end of 2010.
\
Taking action, such as blocking permits or halting federal funding, if states fail to meet the pollution budget.
\
Requiring more large-scale animal farms to have permits.
\
Expanding the scope of stormwater permits.
\
Spending more money on agriculture pollution controls and making sure the money is spent in areas that need it most.
\
Working to combat the negative effects of possible climate change.
\
The reports are posted at http://executiveroder.chesapeakebay.net, where the public also can leave comments.
\
A formal public comment period will begin after the drafts are made into a formal proposal Nov. 9. The report will be made final by May 12, 2010, one year after President Barack Obama issued an executive order seeking a review of bay cleanup plans.

127,"The main purpose of most politicians is to stay in power. To do this they need to give their constituents what they want. This takes money. To get money, they need to enact taxes, fees, permits, tolls and licenses, much of which is legalized theft.\I have a sheet of legal-size paper full of the various taxes we pay. What is not on that list is the ""cap and trade"" tax we pay in this state.\This tax is ridiculously justified by the alarmist notion that we are warming the planet by burning fuels that give off the now ""toxic"" gas carbon dioxide, as just decreed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We are paying an extra tax on all forms of fuel in Maryland. This adds to the business-unfriendly environment the governor and liberal legislators have made.\Businesses would flock to this state if taxes were low and oppressive legislation was eliminated. Worcester County is paying Baltimore City 18 percent off the top of its casino profits. Why? Now Gov. O'Malley is proposing giving in-state tuition costs to illegal immigrants, an $8 toll on the Bay Bridge and higher tolls in other areas.\Americans for Prosperity, a tea party organization, fought and defeated the 10-cent per gallon tax at the pump. Imagine the mean-spiritedness of these politicians wanting to add substantially to the already outrageous cost of gasoline and diesel fuel, after defeating the fabulously lucrative natural gas drilling in western Maryland.\This single endeavor would decrease our taxes and put thousands to work. Pennsylvania has been doing it in the same Marcellus shale formation since 2003. What have we been doing? But we have the first state department of education about to mandate an environmental curriculum for high school graduates.\Why can Florida function with no state income tax? Why did Texas create 265,000 jobs when the rest of the country created 266,000? Is it because of conservative leadership making those states friendly to business?\Texas has no state income tax or capitol gains taxes. It will not enforce the federal mandate for curly mercury bulbs. It drills for oil and natural gas. Texas is about to enact a law stating that the loser in a lawsuit will pay the defendant's expenses. Could Maryland ever rise to that level?\Dennis W. Evans\Berlin\Obama's had some successes\During a Republican presidential candidates debate, Ron Paul was asked if he could name one thing President Obama has accomplished. Paul answered that was a tough question. Oh, really?\Let's start with saving the car industry. Economists estimate that between 1 million and 2 million jobs were saved by refusing to let Chrysler and General Motors go under. Both car companies are back on their feet, have paid back the loans and are hiring.\Passing the Affordable Care Act was a huge accomplishment. 40,000 people die unnecessarily each year for lack of health insurance. Under the health care law, this will change as the law is fully implemented.\How about bringing justice to our country for Sept. 11? Osama bin Laden was still plotting to kill Americans when he was killed by our Navy SEALs as a result of a gutsy decision by President Obama.\The stimulus created more jobs in 2010 than President Bush did in eight years. Republicans refused to acknowledge that, because most did not support it. Many did, however, have their pictures taken in their local district as jobs were created so they could get credit for President Obama's success.\Tom Wallace\Ocean Pines\Bozman's work noted by colleagues\The recent passing of John Bozman signals the end of an era in community journalism in Salisbury and environs.\Susan Canfora's tribute (""John Bozman: Above the fold,"" July 13) and his obituary touched on the many fine qualities he brought to The Daily Times and its affiliate publications.\As strange as it may sound, he started in the business when ""cut-and-paste"" meant exactly that -- taking a pair of scissors to a typewritten story and rearranging the order of paragraphs with glue before it went to a typesetter.\When word processors were introduced in the newsroom in the 1980s, John embraced the equipment as a tool that would make him a better journalist and The Times a better newspaper.\Unlike the younger journalists he enthusiastically mentored, John didn't go to college to study the craft. He came by his word-smithing talents naturally. He was a voracious reader with an innate sense of curiosity who loved talking (and listening) to folks.\He worked long hours, ignoring the clock to make sure he had polished his prose or that of a fellow reporter just so. His work ethic and commitment to the profession -- making that extra phone call to get the penultimate fact or quote -- went unnoticed by The Times readers but not those of us who were honored to work alongside him.\Bill Robinson\Salisbury\GOP puts itself in harm's way\I'm concerned about the impasse in Washington, but also for the Republican Party and for the predictable -- and unpredictable -- economic and social consequences if the country defaults.\The country has an interest in a viable, responsible two-party system.\I want Rep. Andy Harris to succeed in helping to make the country a better place. But I genuinely, really do feel congressional conservatives are following Grover Norquist, Rush Limbaugh and Tea Party pied pipers off a steep cliff.\Please recall the deeply negative public reaction already to Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal.\If the debt ceiling is not raised and if the Republicans' Norquistian refusal to compromise on revenue enhancements comes to be perceived as the precipitating cause of ensuing economic distress, public anger will torpedo the GOP.\Some revenue enhancements, especially closing egregious tax loopholes (not excluding the mortgage interest deduction), are essential to getting the budget back on to a credible glidepath toward balance.\The revenue increases should not go into effect immediately, in order to let the economy recover further. But they should be scheduled to phase in during the proximate future, thereby making it believable that we are serious about getting the budget back under control.\D.

128,"
The federal government promised yesterday to take a more active role in cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay, vowing to crack down on states in the watershed if they miss the mark on pollution reductions.
\
Lisa P. Jackson, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said she'll block permits or yank federal funding as punishment, if necessary.
\
""It's a challenge that has persisted more than two decades and one that has seen a lot of study and strategy, but not nearly enough action,"" Jackson said in a conference call with reporters yesterday afternoon.
\
She said that restoring the bay is ""one of our nation's most significant challenges.""
\
The EPA's promises came as several federal agencies issued reports outlining new ideas for doing a better job of restoring the health of the nation's largest estuary. The reports were responses to an executive order signed by President Barack
\
Obama in May.
\
And while environmentalists lauded the reports as a step in the right direction, they cautioned that only time will tell if these promises are kept - or if they'll be broken, as other pledges made over the years have been.
\
""If all these things that were announced today can come to pass, it will have a very positive impact on the bay,"" said Doug Siglin, federal lobbyist for the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
\
But he warned: ""It's a big 'if.' I think today's reports indicate a lot of good intentions, but there's a lot of steps in between announcing intentions and getting it done.""
\
The key report came from the EPA, which has ultimate authority over water quality under the federal Clean Water Act.
\
The EPA promised to speed up its development of a ""pollution budget,"" which will specify how much nutrient and sediment pollution the bay can safely absorb.
\
Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus flow into the bay from sewage plants, septic systems, farms, urban and suburban stormwater runoff and air pollution. They fuel the growth of algae blooms, which ultimately suck life-sustaining oxygen from the water.
\
Sediment also reaches the bay in stormwater runoff, clouding the water and smothering grasses and oysters.
\
Once EPA sets the pollution budget, by the end of 2010, states will further divvy up the amounts among rivers and will be responsible for crafting plans to meet the targets.
\
If the states fail, the EPA may step in with sanctions, including yanking federal grants, blocking water discharge permits and halting new sources of pollution, such as construction of subdivisions.
\
Jackson said blocking permits isn't the preferred course of action. But she said she won't hesitate to do it if necessary.
\
Other ideas offered by federal agencies yesterday included:
\
Expanding the number of factory farms, called ""confined animal feeding operations,"" that need to have permits.
\
Expanding the scope of federal stormwater discharge permits, which counties and towns must obtain, to include goals for water quality.
\
Ensuring that new and expanding pollution sources are offset by reductions elsewhere.
\
Targeting grant money more efficiently to areas where the environmental need is greatest.
\
Keeping a close watch on sewage plant upgrades to make sure the major plants remain on schedule for pollution-reducing technology.
\
The reports will be consolidated into a more formal proposal by Nov. 9 and finalized by May 12, exactly one year after the president's executive order.
\
If the plans are carried out, Jackson said the bay should be clean enough by 2025 to be removed from the list of the nation's ""impaired waters."" The bay was supposed to be off the list by 2010, but officials acknowledge that won't happen.
\
Carrots and sticks
\
For years, bay advocates have decried the federal government's lack of serious action on restoring the Chesapeake Bay.
\
They've lamented that there have been no consequences for missing the various cleanup goals that have been set again and again over the years. Up to this point, pollution reductions were voluntary.
\
The EPA promise to enforce pollution limits was good news that has been a long time coming, said Tommy Landers, policy advocate for Environment Maryland, a nonprofit group.
\
""After 25 years of approaches of all carrots and no sticks, we're finally getting to see sticks here,"" Landers said.
\
But, like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation representative, he noted that the enforcement plan is just a proposal at this point.
\
""It really could be a game-changing thing for the bay if it's done right. ... The devil is going to be in the details,"" he said.
\
Author Howard Ernst, who is often critical of bay restoration efforts, was not impressed with the feds' ideas.
\
""The more things change, the more they stay the same,"" he said.
\
Ernst noted that states will be held accountable for reducing pollution, but there's very little in the reports to help them crack down on farms, which are the top source of bay pollution.
\
Ernst, who teaches political science at the Naval Academy, also said that while the promises of better enforcement are good, the EPA is rather late in coming to the idea. He hopes the EPA will now follow through, but isn't holding his breath.
\
""If previous actions are an indicator of future behavior, there's little reason to think they'll come through on this promise,"" he said.

129,"The report released Sunday by United Nations climate scientists on what it would take to avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change offers little in the way of good news. The old goal of holding the average global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius isn't sufficient - and we weren't on track to achieving it anyway, because the United States, the worlds second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, isn't committed to it thanks to President Donald Trump's determination to exit the Paris climate accords. Instead, we need to hold the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius if we are to have any hope of avoiding mass droughts, famines, refugee crises, destruction of coastal communities and even more frequent extreme weather events. And that doesn't even speak to the toll on the natural environment, which would see mass extinctions. Put another way, the economic cost of the 1.5-degree rise would be $54 trillion globally, compared to $69 trillion if the average increase hits 2 degrees.\Here's the bright side, such as it is: We could achieve the lower level of warming with existing technologies. It would merely take a coordinated human response that is unprecedented in scale. Given the political realities, not just here but also in the developing world where climate concerns tend to be framed against the effort to lift massive populations out of poverty, that may sound unimaginable. But if we want to preserve anything like life as we know it, we need to start imagining. Here are a few things a real effort at limiting rising temperatures would mean.\• First and foremost, we would need to radically remake the energy sector. Depending on the mix of solutions we pursue, we would need to cut fossil fuel use for electricity generation in half or more by 2050 (some scenarios say we need to eliminate it almost entirely), and in all circumstances, coal fired power plants would need to all but disappear. Use of renewable energy would need to quadruple and become the dominant form of generation. On the plus side, trends are already headed in that direction, and advances in biomass and storage for energy from solar and wind are encouraging, but we would need to achieve the transformation on a much larger scale than we are now.\• Energy efficiency will be key. Under a status quo scenario, global energy use would rise 75 percent by 2050. We would need to hold that to about 10 percent to achieve the 1.5-degree target, and some groups have modeled scenarios in which the population increases, the economy grows and we still use less total energy in 2050 than we do today. Efficiency is particularly important in industry, which is the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and in transportation. Better land use, planning and logistics will be needed to cut down on transportation emissions, as well as greater use of buses and trains than cars, trucks and airplanes.\• Meanwhile, we would need to use de-carbonized electricity for more and more of our energy needs, including heating and transportation. The UN report anticipates an increase in the use of low-carbon fuels in the transportation sector from about 10 percent now to 40 percent by 2050. Air travel is a real problem point here - unless the aerospace industry can come up with massive increases in energy efficiency or some as-yet unknown form of non-carbon propulsion, flying would have to become much rarer and train travel much more common.\• Agriculture would change massively. Most scenarios to reduce carbon emissions to the extent necessary rely heavily on bio-energy and carbon capture technology (more on that last part shortly). The bio-energy part of the equation means growing plants for use in generating electricity, whether by burning or some form of chemical energy generation. The plus side is that the plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while it grows. The down side is that it would displace vast amounts of land that would otherwise be used to grow crops for food needed by an ever-growing population. Likewise, reforestation is an important component of the plans for its ability to pull carbon from the atmosphere and store it long-term, and that, too, squeezes agriculture. A clear consequence of all this is that meat would have to become a much smaller part of the global diet - it is carbon-inefficient to produce, creates potent greenhouse gases of its own (such as methane) and takes up a lot of land.\• Technologies that exist now but which are not deployed on any kind of commercial scale would need to expand massively. Carbon capture is a big one - whatever emissions we produce from generating electricity would need to be captured and stored, likely in geological formations underground or depleted oil and gas fields. It's technically possible but has not been done in any kind of cost-effective way. The UN panel makes carbon capture, biofuels and other exotic (but existing) technologies a significant part of its plan as a way to apply the brakes to emissions (and even get to net-negative emissions) in the later decades of its forecast, but not everyone is buying that idea. Others have come up with ways to hold climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius without them (or at least without much of them), but it requires much bigger advances on all other fronts.\• The economic incentives for de-carbonization would need to change. The most obvious way to achieve that is through carbon pricing, whether through a direct tax, or a cap and trade scheme, but the UN panel says the price would need to be far higher than anyone has attempted - $135-$5,500 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution by 2030. To put that in context, Australia had perhaps the most ambitious carbon tax, $23 per ton, enacted in 2013. It worked but was massively unpopular and was repealed a short time later.\All of this sounds daunting, but it's way harder than that. The problem isn't that achieving all that would be necessary would necessarily lead us to a poorer future than the present in which we live - the efficiencies and new industries this effort would require are generally expected to be a net positive for the global economy, and the U.N. found real synergies between its goals for sustainable development in poorer countries and the strategies necessary to combat climate change. But it would require an understanding that grappling with climate will have to be the singular occupation of humanity for decades to come. It may be a lost cause to hope that the current occupant of the White House, he who made no comment on the U.N. report but has pledged to revive the coal industry, will even begin to recognize the importance of the challenge before us, and that means, at best, two more wasted years.\But we can show our willingness to recognize the urgency of climate change. California has done it with its own carbon pricing plan. Voters in Washington State will get the chance to enact their own. Here in Maryland, we can elect people this fall who will put Maryland on a path toward 100 percent clean energy. There may be no substitute for action by the United States government, but we are not helpless. We know what needs to be done, and we all must start demanding it.\Caption: KAL/Baltimore Sun"
130,"WASHINGTON - He first achieved national renown with a speech hailing bipartisanship, but will leave the White House with the widest partisan gap in approval ever recorded.\He spent much of his presidency singing the praises of cooperation across party lines, but nearly all his major accomplishments resulted from party-line votes or executive actions.\And if Republicans accused him of paying too much attention to Democratic interests, allies blamed him for neglecting his party. Democrats lost a dozen governorships and hundreds of state legislative seats, as well as control of Congress, during his tenure.\President Barack Obama leaves office with job approval ratings comparable to the final marks for Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. But unlike them, Obama's support is overwhelmingly party based.\Eight in ten Democrats on average approved of Obama's work over the last eight years while only about one in eight Republicans did so. Now nearly nine in ten Democrats and six in ten independents, but only about one in seven Republicans, give him positive marks, according to polling by the non-partisan Pew Research Center.\That's disheartening for the leader who was hailed at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, when he was a little-known Illinois state legislator running for the U.S. Senate, when he declared ""there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America.""\Last January, in his final State of the Union address, Obama cited the increase in partisanship during his presidency as among his greatest regrets.\In an interview with the Washington Bureau several weeks later, Obama said he still believed in bipartisanship, but that he had decided early it could not be his top priority.\""Bipartisanship is not a virtue if we don't do anything, and we just leave problems unsolved,"" Obama said. ""Bipartisanship is a virtue if we, both sides, (say) 'Look, we have a problem. We may differ on how we solve it, but let's sit down and negotiate.' And there's never been an issue in Washington that I haven't been willing to take a half loaf or a quarter loaf.""\As he saw it, he had tried again and again without success to divide the loaf, only to be met with what the White House saw as relentless opposition.\After all, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky famously said in 2010 that the ""single most important thing"" for the GOP was to make Obama a one-term president, a goal hardly conducive to compromise.\""When you can't get a negotiating partner across the table who is going to agree to anything, then you have to make a decision,"" Obama said about the fight over the 2010 Affordable Care Act. ""Do I just drop it? Or ... do you say, 'Wow, I've got millions of people out there who don't have health insurance and I need to go forward' ""?\""At that point then, it was just a majority muscle move,"" he added.\Republican leaders claim Obama never offered half a loaf or anything like it. They say he didn't have the legislative experience to cut deals or was too aloof to engage in the fine art of wining and dining lawmakers to his side.\""Almost without exception, President Obama begins serious policy discussions by explaining why everyone else is wrong,"" McConnell wrote in his 2016 autobiography.\""The conversation would last as long as it took the President to feel satisfied that his soliloquy had outlined the issue well enough for me to understand,"" he wrote. ""Speaker Boehner famously put the phone on his desk and carried on a separate conversation during one of these exchanges with the President. I never put the phone down, but on one occasion, I did watch at least an inning of baseball.""\While both political parties blame the other for the widening partisan divide, the causes are not so simple. Leaders were caught in a dynamic that has emerged over decades.\In the 1960s and 1970s, the Democratic and Republican parties had broad coalitions of liberals, moderates and conservatives. Presidents could forge bipartisan consensus for major legislation, from civil rights to environmental protection.\But the ability to compromise weakened in the 1980s as Republicans grew more consistently conservative and Democrats more reliably liberal.\The divide widened under Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush, and worsened further under Obama.\Greater levels of education, the advent of social media, greater racial diversity, increased income inequality, and changes in the economy probably all played a role.\To the extent that Obama and Republicans in Congress have aggravated the gap, the two sides have very different explanations.\As Obama tells it, the story begins early in his first term as he rode to Capitol Hill in the presidential limousine. He was going to meet with Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, then the House minority leader, to discuss ways to stimulate the economy to avert a depression after the housing market collapse at the end of the Bush administration.\Obama said he had phoned Boehner and asked to ""come up to your caucus and talk.""\""As I'm driving over, he puts out a press release saying, 'We're against it,' "" Obama told friends later, referring to the alert he saw on an aide's Blackberry.\""We hadn't talked to anybody yet!""\Dozens of interviews with Obama aides and the president himself suggest that the limousine story, which he told and retold over the years, deeply colored his thinking about his GOP adversaries.\Boehner's team has a different memory of the incident.\They say it wasn't their intransigence that started the gridlock of the last eight years but Obama's initial approach to them.\They say he made clear that the Democratic majority in Congress, led by the newly-elected Democratic president, would push through a economic stimulus bill with or without Republican support.\Obama's handling of the stimulus bill was ""the original sin"" of his young administration, ""setting the course of partisanship and confrontation,"" former Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said.\""There's an argument to be made that the history of the Obama presidency would have been very different if he had insisted on bipartisan discussions and input on the stimulus bill,"" Steel said.\In the end, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as the stimulus was formally known, passed Congress with three Republican votes in the Senate and none in the House.\Mutual recriminations only worsened later that year when the administration and Congress negotiated over Obama's proposed health care reform law.\On that, the two sides again share a story but give it different interpretations.\For months, White House and Senate staffs shuttled up and down Pennsylvania Avenue, chasing potential compromises but finding none.\Eager to break the impasse, Obama invited Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a senior committee member, and several other lawmakers to the Oval Office for a session he thought could clear the way.\He set up the meeting the way he had learned from Republicans in the Illinois Senate: No public arrival. No parade before reporters. Just a few aides and officials in the room.\Grassley, with his low-key manners and graying hair, looked like the negotiating partners of Obama's past. Like Obama, he had done deals across party lines before.\It was early August. They sat in the Oval Office, Obama cross-legged in an arm chair, Grassley leaning back on a beige couch.\Can we make this idea work, or that one? Obama asked, working his way down the list. Is there another way you want to do it? Would he be willing to vote with the Democrats?\After a pause, according to a White House witness, the senator leaned toward the president and looked him in the eye.\""You know what, Mr. President?"" he said, ""I've got to admit - there's no change that allows me to vote for this thing.""\Obama and top advisers told that story often later. To them, it marked the moment they realized the Republicans were not prepared to consider the president's top domestic priority.\The moment symbolized something else for Grassley: Obama had started with a Democratic plan - government-based health care coverage - and was willing to tweak it only to pick up enough Republicans to allow the White House to claim it had bipartisan support.\Grassley said he wouldn't play that game. ""I said to the president, 'That's not bipartisanship,' "" he recalled.\For Obama, who believed in universal health care - or something close to it - the issue was simple. What was the point of winning the White House if you couldn't help people as you'd promised?\The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, passed in early 2010 without a single Republican vote. The party-line dispute contributed to the Democrats' heavy losses in midterm elections later that year, giving Republicans control of the House.\After that, the stalemate was set.\Republicans argued that the Obama was trying to ram his political agenda - including cap-and-trade legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and an overhaul of immigration laws - down their throats.\After bitter debate, the climate change bill was passed by the House but was never brought to a vote in the Senate, where it died. In 2013, the opposite occurred for immigration reform. It narrowly passed the Senate, but died without a vote in the House.\After that, Obama increasingly used executive authority to order rule changes for the environment, immigration, unemployment and other issues.\That means President-elect Donald Trump can reverse or amend many of them as soon as he takes office.\Jim Manley, a former top aide to then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, said Republicans still remember Obama's boast to GOP leaders in the Oval office in 2009. ""Elections have consequences,"" the new president told them.\""They've never forgotten that,"" Manley said.\Credit: Washington Bureau - - christi.parsons@latimes.com - ; By Christi Parsons ;and Lisa Mascaro"

Blame rests exclusively with the government (public) education system, which is graduating people who cannot compute 6 percent sales tax on a $20 purchase; who do not know what happened on Dec. 7, 1941; who cannot name their governor, representative or senators; who do not know the boiling and freezing temperatures of water; who cannot spell; and who cannot find China on a map. As a result, citizens are susceptible to believing preposterous assertions of self-serving politicians, junk scientists, biased journalists, self-proclaimed ""experts"" and conspiracy theorists. Poorly educated people make poor choices about how they live their lives and how they vote; this is why our nation is in trouble.\Ernest I. Cornbrooks III\Salisbury\It should be obvious to anyone we are on an unsustainable path. With our economy headed south, our industrial base in tatters or overseas, our political leadership enthralled by (in no particular order) pharmaceutical and insurance corporations, the Israel lobby, the Military-Industrial Complex and the Wall Street Banksters, the will of the American people barely registers. Our role is to pay up on April 15 and dummy up. The Bush administration broke our country and President Obama's solution is to sweep the pieces under the rug and ""look forward."" Those who believe we can Forrest Gump our way through this by leaving it to the two-party system are dreaming. Failure to investigate 9/11 was just the beginning. There is more to come. When the dollar is dethroned as the world standard for oil purchases, the party will truly be over. It is ignorance and apathy that endangers us.\Shelton F. Lankford\Salisbury\The problems before us are multifaceted; it might boil down to two items we can control -- responsibility and respect. We must be responsible for our families, health, neighborhoods, schools, government, economy and environment. We must also respect ourselves, the rights of others and authority. Too many people look to government for sustenance and protection, without realizing help comes with strings attached. If we do the right thing without being watched, government can be smaller and more efficient; we build schools instead of prisons, unwed births decline, health care costs decrease, our air and water are cleaner and our minds create opportunity. We must prove doing the right thing beats doing the wrong thing. How? We need a common (and flexible) set of values. Regardless of your religious beliefs, the 10 Commandments make a good starting point. It might take a while, but can we do it? Yes, we can.\Dr. Elton Maddox\Salisbury\Our biggest threat comes from within. Zealotry is in vogue, the guidepost for attacking our constitutional rights. Examples: tapping Americans' phones without warrants, murdering a doctor who legally performs abortions or threatening women by denying them the right to control their bodies. Zealots try to impose their social standards on the rest of us while their camp is overrun with moral hypocrites. They wear righteous indignity on their sleeves while secretly not practicing what they preach, as recent events in the Republican Party demonstrate. Teddy Roosevelt said: ""This country will not be a good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a good place for all of us to live in."" Zealots hinder that goal. The country was founded on compromise; zealots have derailed that sacred ideal of our founding fathers. Until we rid our selves of their influence, our country will be threatened.\Geoff Smoot\Hebron\This question reminds me of the six blind men of Indostan who went to see the elephant. Each felt a different part. They ""disputed loud and long, exceeding stiff and strong, though each was partly in the right, all were in the wrong."" Not wanting to be in the wrong, I keyed ""biggest threat"" to the guru everybody goes to today, the Internet. Here I found quite a few blind men. Threats to us right now can include a threat to the world. Some biggies, in no particular order: the central bank, Chinese espionage, the economy, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Mexico drug gangs, racial disparities, climate change and the same old enemy since 1776 -- the Brits -- who may now be sending British Islamic extremist terrorists over here to hurt us again. Get over it Brits, we beat you twice. The biggest threat of all appears to be technology and the Internet.\George T. Mason\Salisbury\Perhaps the greatest threat is the rise of the ""statist"" in so many aspects of American culture and government. Our fierce respect for liberty in all aspects is endangered by those who believe that ""government knows best."" They demonize the rich and promote class envy. They stymie industry and place draconian taxes on commerce. They reject the free market and punish those who prosper. They use flawed, disproven science to blame humans for all environmental woes. They will not protect our culture and way of life from illegal immigration and speak evil of those who do. They do not believe that ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" are inalienable rights from our Creator, but rather, ""privileges"" granted by government. The patriot's bloody footsteps that led us from tyranny to liberty are being trampled on by those who would lead us back to the shackles in the name of ""change.""\Mike McDermott\Pocomoke City\The biggest current threat to our country is Congress. With nationalization of our banking industry, industrial sector and medical system, we are well on our way to becoming a Third World country. We have created a ruling class of 535 people who expanded the role of government beyond the intent of the founders. Elections are little more than pop culture popularity contests. I believe some candidates sincerely aspire to give service to the people -- until they arrive in Washington and the facts of political life are presented. If employer-paid medical benefits are taxed, will Congress be subject to that tax? Who will determine fair compensation for them, as they attempt to do for the private sector? The only solution I see is term limits, but who would want to give up being a member of that most privileged class? What happened to JFK's famous ""Ask not"" quote?\Bill Short\Salisbury\As Pogo said, ""We have met the enemy and he is us!"" There are ideals we hold as a nation, supposedly followed when being governed or reaching out to other nations. Too many Americans are unwilling to consider that others may hold views which they consider equally valid. Politics is the art of compromise. We want those governing us to be willing to compromise and look to the greater good -- not just national gain. Cautions: Our ideals must be applied to today and tomorrow; they can not remain static, locked in the past. The collective we wants immediate action and deliverance on ""promises,"" not considered thought and study of real, actionable issues and solutions. Our national or international policy decisions are seldom black-and-white. There are shades of grey involved in the realities of issues and the actions which can be taken to solve them.\Dick Taeuber\Salisbury"
132,"There was a recent article referring to Dr. John McLean of Salisbury and Ocean City. McLean is charged with Medicare fraud, with authorities claiming that he placed numerous unneeded stents in patients who might have been otherwise been treated with medical prescriptions. This is a judgment call which doctors make depending on the circumstances.\My family members were patients of McLean's for more than 15 years and underwent procedures that included a stent, a quadruple bypass, scar tissue removal and a ""false positive"" -- which means a procedure was not performed because of the false indications.\To me, this indicates that if McLean was capable of fraud, this would have been an excellent chance for fraud. So with a ""widow-maker's heart"" that McLean saved more than 18 years ago and stents that allow blood flow through previously blocked arteries, he still has our grateful thanks and our utmost confidence that he will be exonerated of these disastrous charges.\Bill Russell\Ocean City\Time to try new crime strategies in Pocomoke\On June 17, approximately 35 concerned citizens gathered in Pocomoke City for the purpose of planning a grass roots solution to the increasing area violence. They were concerned about the murder of Reginald Handy three weeks earlier, as well as open-air drug markets in their communities. That group met again in July, when Worcester County State's Attorney Joel Todd gave a presentation on a recent successful operation in Berlin. Todd explained the similarities between Berlin's problems and Pocomoke's, and sought support for a similar operation here.\The citizens in attendance were unanimously supportive. That group met in August and again on Sept. 11, when one man who owns several rental properties in the city stated he was having difficulty finding renters because of the serious drug problems.\My question that day was: What had been done to initiate the operation suggested by Todd two months earlier? My question today is: Who is still keeping this much-needed program from being started? The public wants it and City Council members support it, so why have we not given it the green light? I place the blame squarely in the lap of the mayor and chief of police. It's about our quality of life.\Carroll Overholt\Pocomoke City\Gems of Red Hats have fun and raise funds\The Ocean City Gems chapter of the Red Hat Society held its annual luncheon and fashion show on Wednesday, Oct. 6. The dining room was a sea of purple and red. Eighty-eight Red Hatters enjoyed a delicious meal provided by the Bayside Skillet and watched a very stylish fashion show put on by Dress Barn.\But the best thing about the event was the proceeds going to Women Supporting Women. A guiding principle of the Red Hat Society is that there is fun after fifty, and before, for women of all walks of life. We've decided that there is nothing in the rules that says we can't do some good while having a good time. This was another opportunity to bring awareness to the tragedy that is breast cancer.\We also are indebted to Deb Fletcher who brought her wonderful stock of Red Hat paraphernalia. And we owe a big thank you to all the businesses that provided door prizes. The staff at the Bayside Skillet did a wonderful job. And a big thank you to all the women who attended the event. It truly was a wonderful day.\Sue Harting\Bonnie Mitrecic\Nancy Howard\Ocean City\Former councilwoman endorses James\I served for 12 years on the Ocean City Council. I am a lifelong Democrat. I'm supporting Michael James in his campaign for the Senate seat in the 38th election district.\I've known Michael since we worked at the Carousel in the late 1970s. We have remained friends since that time. As a member of the Ocean City Council, I witnessed the Carousel 'rise from the ashes' under the direction of Michael James; he is a successful small businessman. Today the Carousel is thriving and has dozens of employees thanks to Michael James.\Michael believes that education is the foundation of any child's future and will work to maintain the excellence of our schools. His children have always attended public schools. He recognizes the importance of the environment to an area that depends so heavily on tourism.\As a member of Atlantic General's Board of Directors, Michael appreciates the importance of streamlining health care reform and will apply a common sense approach to that reform. Although not a native, Michael has developed the traditional values of the Eastern Shore. He will work tirelessly for the farmers and watermen who follow in a tradition of backbreaking labor that not only provides food for our tables but invests us with a rugged self-reliance going back generations. These people need serious representation.\Michael James is the candidate who will work for us, not for himself or a party. He's a reader, a listener and an achiever; he works well with others. These are the qualities we need in Annapolis. I know firsthand that he is the better choice for the voters.\Nancy L. Howard\Ocean City\Plantiffs in housing lawsuit should focus elsewhere\I am responding to an article in the Oct. 7 issue, ""Lawsuit against Berlin housing nonprofit group is settled."" This has nothing to do with the BCHC; I'm not involved at all. Yes, I'm in favor of low-income housing for all my brothers and sisters in Christ to live in.\I'm having a problem digesting the representation of the lawsuit by the plantiffs -- the Purnells, not the minister. Some of the same problems the plantiffs state were wrong with the BCHC, they support as right with another nonprofit group they belong to as a vice-president and a board member: the Worcester High School Alumni. BCHC is registered with the state of Maryland as a nonprofit; Worcester High Alumni is not. Information is being hidden that any alumni should know. The organization should be audited.\To the plantiffs: If you want to stand tall for housing, try to also correct the problems with the WHS Alumni, which you both have influence over.\Pat Hingleton\Berlin\Bikes on a sidewalk remain a problem\At the last Ocean City Council meeting, I requested to be put on the agenda to raise the issue of a bike store blocking a public pathway upon occasion. A contract with the bike shop has been violated in the past three years, but the owner was never cited by city employees, even though we had pictures of bikes blocking the right-of-way and written statements about it. It was not adequate, we were told, because it was not done by city personnel.\Joseph Mitrecic said at the Oct. 4 meeting he had talked to Glenn Irwin, director of OCDC, and Blaine Smith, of planning and zoning, and they discussed the contract. When I approached Irwin and Smith, asking if they had talked to him, they said no. As a result, the individuals have not been penalized.\Al Wendling\Ocean Pines\Conway doesn't have tax-cutting reputation\Just when we thought politicians couldn't get more dishonest, we get a full-color glossy in the mail that reads ""cut taxes, reduced spending, there, that's the Norm Conway report.""\It's nice when a career politician can write his ""report"" and ignore a little thing like his own liberal tax and spend voting record, which in this case spans more than two decades. This is so egregious I really am at a loss for words.\The 38B delegate is consistently rated as having one of the most liberal voting records in the state by ""Progressive Maryland.""(Yes, ""progressive"" as in Obama/Pelosi/Reid progressive.) Do you think that he earned that liberal rating by cutting taxes? No. He earned it by voting in lockstep with the liberal leadership of his party. And as is the case with all good liberals, the phrase ""cutting taxes"" only becomes part of the vernacular just before elections.\A ""report"" is defined as ""a formal account of the proceedings or transactions of a group or an individual."" In other words, it's supposed to be the truth. Check out the delegate's voting record for yourself, starting with his recent votes for the O'Malley tax hikes.\When it comes to taxes, the delegate says ""aye."" That's the Norm Conway report.\Steve Lind\Ocean Pines\Kratovil's closer to the vital center\America works best when it is governed from the center. Andy Harris is an arch-conservative, extreme right-wing politician. He will not help bring the Congress to the center. His politics puts him in opposition to legislation that has put a muzzle on usurious credit card practices and student loan programs. In addition, he was opposed to recently passed Wall Street reform legislation. He would also work to repeal health care reform. On the local level, his history of serving in the Maryland Legislature puts him at odds with the environmental needs of the Eastern Shore. He voted against the protection of the Chesapeake Bay.\Frank Kratovil's record in the Congress puts him in the center. He voted for Wall Street reform to put their greed in check. He led the fight to pass credit card reform. He wrote a bill that became law providing an increase in tax credits for small businesses. Although he voted against the health care reform bill due to its possible effect on the deficit, he will work to see that those provisions of the health care bill will aid and assist his constituents.\Additionally, Frank's efforts in the Congress saved Dorchester County crab-picking houses; saved over 100 local dealership jobs; and helped secure funding to protect the health of the Chesapeake Bay. He also introduced legislation to protect coastal regions.\There are many other examples of Kratovil's record in Congress that demonstrate his commitment to work for the general welfare, and that means helping working families and our stressed middle class. In today's world of negative media scrutiny it's impossible to find a politician of our dreams, but it's clear that Andy Harris is a politician of our nightmares.\Richard Lipov\Ocean Pines\Harris record on taxes is stellar\By now, we have all heard ""Independent"" Frank Kratovil's nasty attack ad against Andy Harris, implying that Andy is pushing hard to pass a 23 percent national sales tax.\Andy Harris has made it clear that he is absolutely against raising taxes of any kind, and his voting record proves it. He has steadfastly voted against higher taxes for the past 12 years as a Maryland state senator. Harris has never even once voted to increase our taxes, nor will he.\Frank Kratovil has not signed the Americans for Tax Reforms' Taxpayer Protection Pledge, as Andy Harris has. Kratovil, in lockstep with the Pelosi/Reid tax-and-spend liberal team, has recently voted to pass a cap and trade energy bill which, according to The Wall Street Journal, is ""the largest single tax increase"" on the American family in this country's history. Frank Kratovil's voting record shows his true colors.\Recently, Kratovil's fellow Democrats have also been talking about passing another big tax -- the V.A.T., which is the equivalent of one huge national sales tax. Who is the more likely Congressional candidate to vote for it?\Jef Fernley\Ocean City\Todd has vested interest in county\I am writing to encourage all voters in Worcester County to re-elect Joel Todd for State's Attorney.\Joel was born and raised here in Worcester County, as were his children and grandchildren; in other words, he has a vested interest. We all know that when we have a vested interest in our community we work harder to protect it and to help it to prosper. Joel Todd has been doing this successfully for over 20 years, with a proven record in prosecuting drug and alcohol cases, child abuse and murder cases.\Joel knows he isn't held accountable just during an election year but each and everyday when he sees his neighbors and constituents on the street. They don't care whether he is a Republican or Democrat; they just want a person who gets the job done and done well. Joel's record reflects that he has done just that.\So on Nov. 2, I encourage everyone to vote for Joel Todd for Worcester County State's Attorney. His record speaks for itself.\Paula M. Young\Berlin"
133," WASHINGTON -- After two years' work, a blue-ribbon panel of business, government and science leaders said yesterday that the United States must reject the ""false dichotomy"" of jobs vs. environmental protection and recommended that gasoline taxes be increased and water subsidies to growers eliminated.\ The report of the National Commission on the Environment is being offered to President-elect Bill Clinton as a blueprint for his administration. Many of the panel's members are Clinton advisers.\ The panel recommended that the federal government adopt tax policies to stimulate ""green"" research and development, and it called for taxes on environmentally harmful activities.\ It also said Washington should gradually and predictably increase gasoline taxes over a period of several years, enact a carbon tax to be phased in gradually and reduce or eliminate water subsidies to growers.\ The commission's recommendations are similar to many that environmentalists have called for before -- from community meetings to last summer's Earth Summit in Brazil.\ But the work is apt to receive special attention in the new administration because of the makeup of the panel, which was convened and funded by the World Wildlife Fund.\ Chaired by Russell E. Train, the former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, the panel included executives from such companies as Southern California Edison and Alcoa, along with officials and prospective appointees of the Clinton administration.\ Among them were Alice M. Rivlin, newly named deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, former Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, a close Clinton adviser during both the campaign and transition, and James G. Speth, a Clinton adviser for the environment and natural resources.\ Despite the political influence of their proponents, some of the recommendations would appear to face a bleak future.\ A prime example is the suggested increase in the federal gasoline tax. The concept was sharply opposed by Mr. Clinton during the election campaign."
134," Yes, indeed, there is only one real superpower -- and in the oil sector its name is Saudi Arabia. It was strong before the Persian Gulf conflict, even stronger when the war was over. When Saudi Arabia wanted world oil prices low, as it did during recent years, prices stayed low. Now, suddenly, it indicates it wants prices to go up. Up they go!\ Why the wealthy desert kingdom has switched tactics is a matter of intense speculation. One persuasive theory has it that Saudi Arabia wanted to show its opposition to European Community planning for a carbon-energy tax that would have amounted to a $3 levy on each barrel of oil now, and $10 by the year 2000. As chief world exporter of oil, which has been selling around $20 a barrel, Riyadh wondered why consumer governments should benefit from a projected $95 billion revenue windfall at the expense of producer governments.\ The Europeans went into retreat right after the Saudi switch. They scotched the carbon tax as an EC proposal to prevent global warming at the Earth Summit in Rio next week, thus precipitating a decision by the EC environment chief to boycott a conference where, he complained, ""everything, or virtually everything, has been arranged.""\ The other notion in oil circles is that Saudi Arabia is experiencing one of its rare cash flow problems and figures this is a good time to ease tensions with some of the price hawks in OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. So instead of increasing production to meet summer demand, its usual stance as a price dove, it opted last week to keep present ceilings where they are. The result: projected price increases of $3 a barrel, or 7 to 8 cents a gallon at the pump.\ For the United States. the Saudi move could raise interest rates and inflation rates marginally and slow down economic recovery. This undoubtedly will cause some chafing, but little more. Americans will go on paying what they have to pay to keep on driving their cars, oblivious to the nation's increasing dependence on foreign sources or what the release of auto emissions is doing to the Earth's atmosphere.\ For the Bush administration, the European retreat on a carbon tax was one more trophy to tack on the wall next to its success in forcing Earth Summiteers to abandon hopes for definite timetables and limits on greenhouse emissions. Now the giant Rio gathering may generate mainly hot air.\ Actually, the Europeans may be on to something if a carbon/energy tax could be better targeted to produce environmental benefits than such traditional approaches as straight taxes on oil imports or gasoline at the pump. But with the U.S. economy still flabby and President Bush fighting for political survival in the November elections, the United States is blocking any move at Rio that could impede the recovery. What his administration did not anticipate is that the Saudis would prove helpful in blocking the EC carbon tax, but in ways utterly contrary to White House interests."
135," The industrial revolution, with its dramatic shift from primitive power sources to coal-powered machines, marked the onset of the process that is now viewed by most scientists as a road to a global crisis. Machines have indeed raised the world's standard of living, but as a result of the burning of fossil fuels, the planet's supply of life-supporting oxygen is being depleted while, concurrently, the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide portends unacceptable changes in the earth's climate.\ One of these results, the so-called greenhouse effect, seems already to have warmed the earth's average temperature by a disturbing amount. The eventual consequences, such as the melting of the polar ice cap and the rise in the level to the world's seas, are, at least theoretically, precursors to catastrophe. A rise of even a few feet would inundate the world's lowlands, including its ports and many of its largest cities.\ Groping with the problem, several European nations have proposed a so-called carbon tax on the users of fossil fuels, principally oil and coal. This would be designed to curb the use of fossil fuels and encourage development of alternate energy sources and thus to slow down and, eventually, reverse the frightening increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide -- 14 percent between 1860 and 1960, and now amassing at an even faster rate.\ The carbon tax would appear to be, for the present, a sensible, feasible and relatively painless remedy for environmental deterioration -- if the revenues from it are specifically directed to redress the damages already suffered.\ The proposal would impose a tax of $1 to $3 per gallon on a barrel of oil. This would gradually be increased to $10 a barrel, or more, which is to say at least 24 cents a gallon on gasoline and other petroleum products. By the turn of the century it would bring in an estimated trillion dollars for Europe alone; perhaps double that if the tax is also imposed in North America and Japan.\ What is still vague in this discussion is a plan to put to constructive use the vast sums of money that would be generated by such a tax. Among the reasons that the survival of humanity is in jeopardy are not only the increase in carbon dioxide, but the depredation of the world's forests, the ""oxygen factory"" that, through the process of photosynthesis, replenishes the supply of the life-supporting gas.\ Therefore one of the principal uses of the carbon tax receipts ought to be a worldwide reforestation program, and extraordinary efforts to save the rain forests that remain -- principally in South America and Africa. A proportion of each country's carbon-tax revenues should be donated for this purpose to an international agency under the United Nations.\ Other receipts should be directed toward intensive development of alternate sources of non-polluting energy. Again, this would be best achieved through an international agency, or at the very least through international cooperation.\ What are the economic pitfalls en route to such a carbon tax? For one thing, it would require a degree of international agreement seldom achieved in the past.\ If, for example, the tax were imposed in Europe but not in the United States, the comparatively inexpensive fuel on this side of the Atlantic would give America an unfair economic advantage. To work, the tax would have to be levied at the same rate in every industrial country. Given America's current tax phobia, that is a tall order.\ At the Rio conference the world learned that the Bush administration was not ready to assume the initiative in taking dramatic steps to halt environmental degradation. Despite the environmental record of Vice President Gore, the Clinton administration will face the same tax phobia. In Europe the tax has at least been formally proposed. In America there is scarcely even talk of it.\ At the same time, people who walk the streets of Los Angeles, Denver, Cleveland or Baltimore are becoming aware of the putrid state of the urban environment, no less than Europeans confronting the appalling smog in Athens, Marseille or Berlin, or Asians in Seoul or Tokyo. Everywhere, pollution is becoming intolerable from both a local and a worldwide perspective. Global warming is no respecter of continents.\ One can imagine the resistance, not only from the rank and file of tax-hating Americans and their timorous representatives, but from the business community, seeing only next year's bottom line, not the next generation's disaster. In the long run, however, there will be no choice.\ Stanley A. Blumberg is a Baltimore writer. Gwinn Owens is a retired editorial writer for The Evening Sun."
136," The governor and the leadership of the General Assembly have agreed to develop, by the end of January, a plan to address Maryland's fiscal crisis. Their task is not an easy one.\ The challenge for the state's leaders is to develop a fiscal package which is economically responsible, socially just and politically achievable. If taxes are to be on the agenda, the state's leaders would do well to consider an additional objective -- promoting a healthy and sustainable environment.\ One of several options affecting energy use identified by the General Assembly's Joint Study Group on Revenues is an air pollution tax on fossil fuel consumption. Such a tax can both provide environmental benefits and contribute to the resolution of the state's fiscal problems. This tax, also known as carbon tax, would be levied on fossil fuels at rates proportional to the carbon content of each fuel.\ At the same time it will raise revenues, an air pollution tax will also reduce carbon dioxide emissions and conventional air pollution: by increasing fossil fuel prices, it encourages more efficient use of energy and stimulates development of renewable technologies; and by changing relative prices, it encourages a shift in consumption from coal and oil to cleaner-burning natural gas.\ Another benefit of an air pollution tax will be its ability to help remedy Maryland's failure to comply with Clean Air Act requirements, which will subject the state to sanctions that include a cutoff of federal highway funds if air pollution is not reduced. It will also discourage the use of fuels that emit more carbon dioxide, the most important of the so-called ""greenhouse gases"" which are responsible for the threat of global warming.\ If levied at a modest rate of $7.50 per ton of carbon, an air pollution tax would raise approximately $200 million annually. This would represent a tax of two-tenths of a cent per kilowatt hour on electricity, 1.2 cents per therm on natural gas, and about 2 cents per gallon on gasoline and fuel oil. At this rate, the tax would be lower than the energy taxes already levied by several counties and much lower than the existing state motor fuels tax. The tax would add approximately $50 to the average household's combined annual bill for residential energy and gasoline.\ There are other proposals studied by the Joint Study Group on Revenues that address energy consumption. But most of them, such as a proposal to impose the state's 5 percent sales tax on consumption of residential fuels and electricity, fail to distinguish between clean and dirty fuels. Like the existing utility tax, these alternatives would tax clean renewable energy sources at the same rate as a dirty coal plant.\ These alternatives would also not raise as much revenue as an air pollution tax. Compared with the $200 million raised by such a tax, the sales tax on energy would raise about $110 million, yet would add up to $20 more per year to the average household energy bill than the air pollution tax.\ The air pollution tax has a broader base than any of the alternatives because it would be imposed on all fossil fuels and across all sectors of the economy.\ Even though it spreads the tax burden more evenly, an air pollution tax, like other taxes on energy, is regressive. To mitigate this effect, residential utility bills up to a specified ""baseline"" amount could be exempted from the tax, or revenues could be used to finance tax credits or weatherization programs for low-income households. Although the effect on coal prices is small, some of the revenues from the tax could also be earmarked for economic adjustment programs in coal-producing areas which already face change as a result of the recent federal Clean Air Act amendments.\ A common argument against a pollution tax is that it will hurt business. But at a rate of $7.50 per ton of carbon, the tax is low enough to have a minimum effect on the competitiveness of Maryland business, which is generally taxed at a lower rate than in surrounding states. More importantly, however, the relevant question is not how the tax looks on its own, but how it compares with the alternative fiscal measures available. Sales taxes, property taxes and cutbacks in education or infrastructure development can all damage the state's economic competitiveness.\ In a recent survey of Maryland residents, conducted for the Environmental Leadership Forum, 70% of respondents agreed with the statement: ""If it costs more to protect the environment, we should be willing to pay the burden, even if it means some inconvenience and/or more taxes, user fees or higher retail prices."" Many Marylanders have shown their support for this idea by paying additional fees for the ""Treasure the Chesapeake"" license plate.\ The concern of Maryland residents for the environment is justifiable. With its vast Chesapeake Bay coastline, Maryland stands to lose more than most states in the event of rapid global warming. And since Baltimore is the fourth dirtiest city in the nation for smog, the state will benefit from a redirection of energy investments toward cleaner technologies. An air pollution tax will help address these serious concerns at the same time it contributes to solving the state's critical financial problems.

137,"Tax pollution, not rain\I feel the stormwater fee has failed to achieve its goal, which is to reduce the pollution that makes it into the Chesapeake Bay (""Churches seek break on city stormwater fee,"" June 12). The current implementation of the stormwater fee unfairly fines those of us that are making investments in reducing pollution for the benefit of those who are not. For example, two people have identically sized lots. Person A has a lawn service dump fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides once a week on his lawn. Person B planted drought tolerant ground cover that does not require any chemicals at all. Both Person A and Person B pay the same stormwater fee regardless. There is no incentive for Person A to reduce his bad habits and Person B feels jaded for all his efforts to do the right thing. Businesses are not encouraged to clean up their acts either. Two identically sized business properties would pay the same stormwater fee. Yet one could have a parking lot full of manure and coal while the other could contain brand new electric vehicles. \The end goal is to reduce the pollutants in the bay. The best method to accomplish this is by taxing the pollutants at the source. Just as cigarettes, liquor and other products have an additional tax upon them, pollutants should have a tax as well. As people have suggested a carbon tax on all things that produce carbon dioxide, I am proposing a pollution tax that would be based on the amounts of pollution in items that typically end up in the bay. This might include fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides and automotive fluids like antifreeze and oils. The more toxic and concentrated the pollutant, the higher the tax. \How effective would the cigarette tax have been in reducing smoking if instead of taxing the cigarettes we equally taxed everyone for the wind that blew the smoke into other people's lungs? The stormwater is not to blame, it is the pollution that needs to be addressed. \Frank Smith, Glen Burnie \A cure for stormwater pollution: porous asphalt \The answer to the new stormwater fees and requirements is porous asphalt (""Churches seek break on city stormwater fee,"" June 12). \When such asphalt is used, rainwater drains through the top layer and eventually runs back into the soil underneath the asphalt. This eliminates the need for drainage structures and drainage areas and stops runoff into ecologically sensitive or protected waterways. \Moreover, it costs less overall than traditional paving options, is better for the environment and should be exempt from the high fees imposed by local governments. \Steve Hollenbeck \Carbon tax is best answer \America must lead the world in addressing the threat of climate change (""Climate change warnings,"" June 12). This is why Maryland Senators Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski must join Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and California Senator Barbara Boxer to work for the passage of the Climate Protection Act of 2013, which will put a price on carbon and shift the United States away from dirty energy and toward clean power. This landmark legislation will send a clear signal to the rest of the world that the United States is willing to back up its rhetoric with firm action when it comes to reducing carbon emissions. \We must make sure that the Climate Protection Act of 2013 becomes law. The fate of present generations -- not just future generations -- depends on it. \D. R. Tucker, Brockton, Mass. \Flacco's salary and Adam Smith's paradox of value \The op-ed pieces that are occasionally presented by local professors are eye opening, not for their insight but for their lack thereof. If professor Don Norris (""Flacco's contract shows America's skewed priorities,"" June 121) had taken an Economics 101 course, he would have certainly studied the paradox of value. In ""Wealth of Nations,"" Adam Smith wrote, ""The things which have the greatest value in use frequently have little or no value in exchange; on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange frequently have little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce anything; scarce anything can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any use-value; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it."" \Smith's solution to this apparent paradox was that the value in exchange of a thing is determined by its supply relative to its demand. As for Joe Flacco, his compensation is not derived from the value that he provides to society, which like the diamond has little value in use, but to the scarcity of his skills. There are may be only 50 people in the world that can quarterback a professional football team. As for the professor, he may not be as abundant as water, but there are millions of individuals with the professor's skills. \The professor is about to learn another economic concept: creative destruction. As massively open on-line courses become the new paradigm of learning, there will be many professors who will find more to lament than Joe Flacco's compensation. \Steve Williams, Towson\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
138,"Last February, Maryland legislators voted to require that 25 percent of the state's electricity be generated by so-called ""renewable"" sources beginning in 2020. Now, they are considering an additional requirement that 50 percent of electricity come from renewables by 2030. One lawmaker, Montgomery County Del. Shane Robinson, a Democrat, wants 100 percent renewables by 2050. According to proponents, these mandates will help protect the environment, create ""green"" jobs and improve human health. But in truth, renewables are little more than corporate welfare dressed up in ill-fitting ""green"" clothing.\Renewable energy standards don't do much - if anything - to improve the environment or human health, and they create precious few permanent jobs. ""Renewable"" under Maryland law simply means the energy is generated from sources that typically are either cheap or free. That includes wind, sunlight and flowing water (though the capital used to harness them is expensive and often has environmental downsides). But ""renewable"" also includes energy generated from the burning of plant matter, animal manure, methane and trash - fuels that are neither environmentally clean nor healthful.\Some supporters admit that ""renewables"" aren't perfect, but they argue the energy sources are better than how electricity is generated now. They envision power companies closing their dirty coal-fired plants and replacing them with windmills and solar panels. But wind and solar hardly ever replace coal plants.\Wind and solar are sporadic sources whose production often declines on especially hot or cold days when electricity demand is high. Coal-fired supply, on the other hand, is consistent and cannot be quickly throttled back or ramped up. For that reason, coal is used to supply ""baseline"" power, satisfying steady demand that is always present. The good news for earnest environmentalists is that coal-fired power in the United States is slowly being replaced - but by highly efficient, low-emissions natural gas-fired plants, not windmills or solar panels.\Beyond baseline power, other generation sources are used to cover surges in demand. Solar and wind can be used for this ""peaking"" demand, if they are available on a particular day. But conventional peaking sources - typically natural gas, again - usually have low impact on the environment. If the ever-stricter Maryland renewables mandate leads to windmills and solar panels replacing some natural gas production, then there might be a modest environmental gain. But if the mandate means natural gas (or nuclear) generators are replaced by the burning of trash, biomass, methane and manure, then the requirements will harm the environment and human health. There are much more effective - and cheaper - ways to reduce pollution and combat climate change.\Renewables mandates do change a couple of things, however: they raise electricity bills and income for energy companies and their Wall Street backers. The Maryland General Assembly's Department of Legislative Services estimated that last February's 25 percent mandate will raise households' power bills $1 to $3 a month. That may not sound like much, but it adds up to between $49 million and $196 million (depending on assumptions) transferred from Maryland customers to corporate coffers in 2020 alone. The 50 percent proposal will mean even higher bills and hundreds of millions more dollars for corporate beneficiaries.\ So why are Maryland politicians and environmental groups pushing increasingly tougher renewables mandates? The answer involves a common dynamic in politics: the ""bootleggers and Baptists coalition."" In Southern ""dry"" counties, alcohol prohibition is favored by both Baptists and bootleggers (for very different reasons). Likewise, renewable energy mandates are favored by both high-minded (but sometimes naive) environmentalists and not-so-high-minded but very shrewd energy companies and their Wall Street backers. Maryland's mandate ensures those companies and financiers will have a profitable market for their expensive electricity.\If Maryland lawmakers want to get serious about combating climate change and reducing pollution, they can simply tax the emission of carbon and other pollutants, thereby encouraging lower emissions and greater efficiency. No one likes a new tax, but it is a much cheaper and more effective way to cut pollution and fight climate change than a byzantine policy like the renewables mandate. Besides, revenue from a carbon tax could be used to reduce other taxes and fund other environmental initiatives. Problem is, though a carbon tax would be good for the environment and human health, it wouldn't funnel money to politicians' friends in corporate boardrooms and on Wall Street.\Maryland's renewables standard isn't about the environment and human health; it's about money. So in a sense the requirement is ""green"" - just not in the sense of cleaner air or a cooler planet.\Thomas A.

139,"The awarding of a Nobel prize in economics this week to William Nordhaus - the first economist to develop a model of how the climate and the global economy are linked - highlights a tremendous lost opportunity to fight climate change.\Decades ago, Nordhaus's work provided a set of tools that should have appealed to market-minded politicians as a way to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. Yet American conservatives chose denial instead. And because the right ignored Nordhaus (and those who picked up on his work), it seems unlikely that this country will take the ""unprecedented"" actions that the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said this week are necessary to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\Beginning in the 1970s, Nordhaus demonstrated how a growing economy increases greenhouse gas emissions, which warm the planet, and in turn cause economic damages in sectors as far flung as agricultural production and coastal property. Yet, he observed, the producers of those gases do not pay for the damages they cause.\In 1992, Nordhaus first published a model to estimate the benefits of reducing CO2 emissions. He used it to argue that a modest carbon tax would yield more in climate benefits than it would cost, estimating that an optimal carbon tax would start at $5 per ton of CO2 in the 1990, and rise over time: It would be near $10 per ton today. (Nordhaus's subsequent estimates of the proper carbon price have increased to $30 per ton in today's dollars, although the appropriate rate for a carbon price remains a matter of heated academic debate.\A carbon tax makes greenhouse gas emissions reflect the damages they impose, and nudges financial considerations toward lower-carbon resources. The great power of this mechanism is that it does not subject consumers and businesses to complex regulatory schemes drawn up on desks in Washington, D.C., but instead allows all sectors of the economy to find the lowest-cost paths to cutting emissions.\That Nordhaus published this model 26 years ago underscores just how long global warming has been staring us in the face; 1992 was also the year that President George H.W. Bush signed the convention that created the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which recognized ""that States should enact effective environmental legislation,"" and that developed countries should ""take immediate action ... as a first step towards comprehensive response strategies at the global, national and, where agreed, regional levels.""\A Republican administration had recognized the problem, and an economist with impeccable credentials had provided a solution that respected, and used, markets. Nor did the idea of taxing pollution to account for the damages it caused originate with Nordhaus. Leading conservative thinkers like Milton Friedman championed the concept as a superior alternative to regulations. Given this pedigree, it wouldn't have been outside the realm of possibility for conservatives to have embraced such a tax as a viable approach to climate change.\If Republicans had embraced such an approach, and Democrats joined them - seeking common ground on a crucial issue - today we'd be living in a starkly different world than we are. In this alternate reality we would not see industry whipsawed while successive administrations enact ambitious regulatory programs (Democrats) and then roll them back (Republicans) - with the specter of their return hovering. Instead, the climate debate in Washington would be occurring within the traditional parameters of what the tax rate should be, and how we should be spending the revenue.\Our CO2 emissions would be lower, and coal-fired power, the power source with the highest CO2 emissions, would have been virtually eliminated. Although the fracking revolution that has made natural gas the fossil fuel of choice would still have occurred, its tenure as a ""bridge fuel"" between coal and renewables would be shorter. We would have far more renewable power, with fewer subsidies, because the tax would create an incentive to invest in non-carbon energy sources. We would also have avoided situations like the state-by-state scrambles to bail out nuclear plants for the sake of their zero-carbon electricity, as we've recently seen in Illinois and New York; instead, they would be enjoying the same competitive advantage as wind and solar power over gas- and coal-fired generation.\Meanwhile, economic growth would most likely have been unhindered. A carbon tax might have hampered short-term growth on the margins, but the drag would be lost in the wash of other macroeconomic trends and events. If used to cut other taxes, a carbon tax might have even helped create growth. With higher federal revenues, there would less federal debt, lower federal taxes, or possibly more spending on climate adaptation. Internationally, the United States would have a credible claim to climate leadership, which would also make other countries more inclined to listen to, and follow, the nation on other geopolitical issues.\What's more, climate skepticism, one of the most significant and heavily politicized badges of political affiliation, might have been avoided. For decades, the repudiation of scientific expertise has been, with a few notable exceptions, all but a requirement for card-carrying Republicans. Who knows how many of the knock-on effects of this head-in-the-sand approach - from general anti-intellectualism to the specific ""fake news"" rallying cry - might have been prevented?\A far cleaner environment, markedly less political polarization, and an economy incentivized to be clean: That's what our world would look like had we acted on Nordhaus's ideas when he proposed them. That he was ignored by market-minded conservatives makes the awarding of the prize this week especially poignant.\As the IPCC report shows, we now need to take rapid, massive action to limit climate change. The things we've tried have helped on the margins, but it's time to get serious. Nordhaus still provides a good map for what we could do.\Bookbinder is chief counsel and Majkut is director of climate policy of the Niskanen Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C."
140,"A case for keeping the Lee-Jackson statue\Oh Baltimore, our dear hometown, please get a grip! Are we seriously considering removing the statue of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson in homage to political correctness (""Take the statues down,"" Jan. 19)? \Is one vote from one commission member out of seven in a city of 600,000 going to decide for all of us? \First, the Lee-Jackson double equestrian statue in Wyman Park is simply a beautiful work of art by a woman sculptor that fits splendidly in its setting, regardless of who sits atop the horses. It is also a unique artistic accomplishment, as double equestrian statues are rare. \More importantly, the statue is a piece of our history. Marylanders were divided on the issues of slavery and states' rights. \Why not grasp the teachable moment that seeing these two proponents of a lost cause affords us? Why not realize that just as these men strove for high ideals in some ways and fell short in others, we too have uneven, imperfect characters yet can learn from that. \If we start to erase discomfort, where will we stop? Should we remove the Washington Monument from Mt. Vernon Square because Washington was a slaveholder? Should we close Hopkins undergraduate department because from its founding until only 45 years ago it resolutely closed its doors to women? Or perhaps I should throw away all of my childhood pictures because I don't look like that anymore. \Events and issues play out in the context of their time. History is a development. And if we don't learn its lessons, we are doomed to repeat it. Is that what we want? \Rosemary Warschawski, Baltimore \O'Malley understands climate challenge \I would like to thank Gov. Martin O'Malley for his words on climate change during Sunday's presidential debate (""Democrats take sharp turn,"" Jan. 18). Climate change is an existential threat to humanity, and Governor O'Malley is the only candidate in either party who has consistently given it a top priority. \He has obviously thought deeply about energy and climate issues and has practical, specific ideas for how to address them. A ""yes"" to his statement, ""I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change."" It's unfortunate that more politicians aren't paying attention because a growing number of economists and business leaders also recognize this, and a market-driven transition to sustainable energy is already underway. \I would have liked to hear his ideas about establishing carbon price commensurate with the true cost of burning carbon because although there are continual advances in sustainable-energy technology and its deployment, they cannot occur fast enough without government help to level the playing field. With a market-driven carbon tax, rebated to taxpayers to compensate for the increased price of energy and goods, we could attain critical carbon-emissions targets without new regulations or government bureaucracy. Business, the economy, public health, and the environment would all be winners. \Carol Steinhart, Madison, Wis. \O'Malley's 'furnituregate' \The Sun recently ran a series of reports detailing how former Gov. Martin O'Malley purchased over $60,000 of furniture from the state in a secret no-bid process after he left office (""Prosecutor investigates Martin O'Malley furniture sale,"" Jan. 14). \The reports also indicated that Mr. O'Malley did not pay sales tax on this purchase, which saved him almost $600. \This is the same sales tax that then-Governor O'Malley raised by 20 percent when he called a special session of the state legislature to raise the sales tax to 6 percent from 5 percent. \I guess the fact that he successfully ducked paying the higher sales tax means that he has belatedly realized that such taxes can be quite a burden on average citizens such as himself. \Iver Mindel, Cockeysville \Sewage leaks were ignored for decades \The Sun is finally addressing the rampant pollution caused by the city's sewage leaks (""Water quality advocates press for reforms as city negotiates new deadline to stop sewage leaks,"" Jan 17). \The water pollution caused by indifferent Baltimore City administrations going back over 40 years is certainly appalling. \However, I noticed that your reporter, Scott Dance, failed to mention anything about the sewer odor spewing from the plant. \When my son was 3, he said ""Dad, it smells like a big dog pooped!"" It still does in Essex, Back River and Dundalk. My son is now in his 40s. \It is about time that pressure be put on the Baltimore City government to eliminate both water and air pollution at Back River.

A tragedy in two acts."" by Nathaniel Rich.\In the 1980s, a global consensus of government officials, carbon industry leaders, political parties and scientists acknowledged a future climate change tragedy due to carbon dioxide emissions and realized the need to reduce carbon emissions with a carbon tax. In June 1988, U.S. Sen.

142,"With or without AC, classrooms can be too hot to study\I teach in a Baltimore County school that supposedly has air conditioning (""Dance to review Balto.

Many rooms are completely enclosed and temperatures reach 85 degrees and above. My work space would reach 88 degrees routinely, even when the system was working. One of the classrooms with computers routinely goes above 90 degrees. \My wife works for the U.S. Patent Office in a building with similar features as the school in which I work.

143," Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the House and the Senate, distinguished Americans here as visitors in this chamber as am I, it is nice to have a fresh excuse for a long speech.\ When Presidents speak to the Congress and the nation from this podium, typically they comment on the full range of challenges and opportunities that face the United States. But this is not an ordinary time and for all the many tasks that require our attention, I believe one calls on us to focus, to unite and to act, and that is our economy. For more than anything else, our task tonight as Americans is to make our economy thrive once again.\ Let me begin by saying that it has been too long -- at least three decades -- since a President has come and challenged Americans to join him on a great national journey, not merely to consume the bounty of today but to invest for a much greater one tomorrow.\ Like individuals, nations must ultimately decide how they wish to conduct themselves -- how they wish to be thought of by those with whom they live, and, later, how they wish to be judged by history. Like every individual man and woman, nations must decide whether they are prepared to rise to the occasions history presents them.\ We have always been a people of youthful energy and daring spirit. And this historic moment, as communism has fallen, as freedom is spreading around the world, as a global economy is taking shape before our eyes, Americans have called for change -- and now it is up to those of us in this room to deliver for them. `Nation needs new direction'\ Our nation needs a new direction. Tonight, I present to you a comprehensive plan to set our nation on that new course.\ I believe we will find our new direction in the basic old values that brought us here over the last two centuries: a commitment to opportunity, to individual responsibility, to community, to work, to family and to faith. We need to break the habits of both political parties and say there can be no more something for nothing, and admit, frankly, that we are all in this together.\ The conditions which brought us to this point are well known. Two decades of low productivity and stagnant wages; persistent unemployment and underemployment; years of huge government deficits and declining investment in our future; exploding health care costs, and lack of coverage for millions of Americans; legions of poor children; education and job training opportunities inadequate to the demands of this tough global economy. For too long we drifted without a strong sense of purpose or responsibility or community, and our political system so often has seemed paralyzed by special interest groups, by partisan bickering and by the sheer complexity of our problems. `We can do better'\ I believe we can do better, because we remain the greatest nation on earth, the world's strongest economy, the world's only military superpower. If we have the vision, the will and the heart to make the changes we must, we can still enter the 21st century with possibilities our parents could not even have imagined and enter it having secured the American dream for ourselves and for future generations.\ I well remember, twelve years ago Ronald Reagan stood at this very podium and told the American people that if our debt were stacked in thousand dollar bills, the stack would reach 67 miles into space. Well, today, that stack would reach 267 miles.\ I tell you this not to assign blame for this problem. There is plenty of blame to go around -- in both branches of the government and both parties. The time for blame has come to an end. I did not seek this office to assign blame. I come here tonight to accept responsibility; and I want you to accept responsibility with me. And if we do it right by this country, I do not care who gets the credit for it. `Four fundamental components'\ The plan I offer you has four fundamental components:\ First, it shifts our emphasis in public and private spending from consumption to investment, initially by jump-starting the economy in the short term and investing in our people, their jobs and their incomes in the long term.\ Second, it changes the rhetoric of the past into the actions of the present, by honoring work and families in every part of our public decision-making.\ Third, it substantially reduces the federal deficit, honestly and credibly, by using in the beginning the most conservative estimates of government revenues, not as the executive branch has done so often in the past using the most optimistic ones.\ And finally, it seeks to earn the trust of the American people by paying for these plans first with cuts in government waste and inefficiency; second, with cuts, not gimmicks, in government spending; and by fairness, for a change, in the way the additional burdens are borne.\ Tonight, I want to talk with you about what government can do, because I believe government must do more. But let me say first that the real engine of economic growth in this country is the private sector.\ And second, that each of us must be an engine of growth and change. The truth is that, as government creates more opportunity in this new and different time, we must also demand more responsibility in return. `Priority is to create jobs'\ Our immediate priority is to create jobs, create jobs now. Some say, well, we're in a recovery and we don't have to do that. Well, we all hope we're in a recovery. But we're sure not creating more jobs. And there is no recovery worth its salt that doesn't put the American people back to work.\ To create jobs and guarantee a strong recovery, I call on Congress to enact an immediate package of jobs investment of over $30 billion, to put people to work now, to create half a million jobs: jobs to rebuild our highways and airports, to renovate housing, to bring new life to rural communities, and spread hope and opportunity among our nation's youth.\ And especially, I want to emphasize, after the events of last year in Los Angeles, and the countless stories of despair in our cities and in our poor rural communities, this proposal will create almost 700,000 new summer jobs for displaced, unemployed young people alone this summer.\ And tonight I invite America's business leaders to join us in this effort, so that together we can provide a million summer jobs in cities and poor rural areas for our young people.\ Second, our plan looks beyond today's business cycle, because our aspirations extend into the next century. The heart of this plan deals with the long term. It has an investment program designed to increase public and private investment in areas critical to our economic future.\ Over the long run, all this will bring us a higher rate of economic growth, improved productivity, more high-quality jobs and an improved economic competitive position in the world. In order to accomplish both increased investment and deficit reduction -- something no American government has ever been called upon to do at the same time before -- spending must be cut and taxes must be raised. The spending cuts I recommend were carefully thought through in a way to minimize any adverse economic impact, to capture the peace dividend for investment purposes and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to more investment. The tax increases and the spending cuts were both designed to assure that the costs of this historic program to face and deal with our problems will be borne by those who could readily afford it the most.\ Our plan is designed, furthermore and perhaps in some ways most importantly, to improve the health of American business through lower interest rates, more incentives to invest, and better-trained workers. Because small business has created such a high percentage of all the new jobs in our nation over the last 10 or 15 years, our plan includes the boldest targeted incentives for small business in history.\ We propose a permanent investment tax credit for the smallest firms in this country with revenues of under $5 million.\ That's about 90 percent of the firms in America, employing about 40 percent of the work force, but creating a big majority of the net new jobs for more than a decade. And we propose new rewards for entrepreneurs who take new risks. We propose to give small business access to all the new technologies of our time, and we propose to attack this credit crunch which has denied small business the credit they need to flourish and prosper.\ With a new network of community development banks and $1 billion to make the dream of enterprise zones real, we propose to bring new hope and new jobs to storefronts and factories from South Boston to South Texas to South Central Los Angeles.\ This plan invests in our roads, our bridges, our transit systems and high-speed railways and high tech information systems. And it provides the most ambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with state and local government of our time, to put people to work and to preserve the environment for our future. `Insist on fair trade rules'\ Standing as we are on the edge of a new century, we know that economic growth depends as never before on opening up new markets overseas and expanding the volume of world trade. And so we will insist on fair trade rules in international markets as a part of a national economic strategy to expand trade, including the successful completion of the latest round of world trade talks and the successful completion of a North American Free Trade Agreement, with appropriate safeguards for our workers and for the environment.\ At the same time, and I say this to you in both parties and across America tonight, all the people who are listening, it is not enough to pass a budget or even to have a trade agreement. The world is changing so fast that we must have aggressive, targeted attempts to create the high-wage jobs of the future. That's what all our competitors are doing. We must give special attention to those critical industries that are going to explode in the 21st century, but that are in trouble in America today, like aerospace.\ We must provide special assistance to areas and to workers displaced by cuts in the defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocations.\ And again I will say we must do this together. I pledge to you that I will do my best to see that business and labor and government work together -- for a change. `Tackle health care crisis'\ But all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail -- let me say this again; I feel so strongly about this -- all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail unless we also take this year -- not next year, not five years from now, but this year -- bold steps to reform our health care system.\ In 1992 we spent 14 percent of our income on health care, 30 percent more than than any other country in the world, and yet we were the only advanced nation that did not provide a basic package of health care benefits to all of its citizens. Unless we change the present pattern, 50 percent of the growth in the deficit between now and the year 2000 will be in health care costs. By the year 2000 almost 20 percent of our income will be in health care. Our families will never be secure, our businesses will never be strong, and our government will never again be fully solvent -- until we tackle the health care crisis. We must do it this year.\ The combination of the rising costs of care and the lack of care and the fear of losing care are endangering the security and the very lives of millions of our people, and they are weakening our economy every day. Reducing health care costs can liberate literally hundreds of billions of dollars for new investment and growth and jobs. Bringing health costs in line with inflation would do more for the private sector in this country than any tax cut we could give, than any spending program we could promote. Reforming health care over the long run is critically essential to reducing not only our deficit but to expanding investment in America. `We can do better'\ Later this spring, after the first lady and the many good people who are helping her all across the country complete their work, I will deliver to Congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform that finally will bring costs under control and provide security to all of our families so that no one will be denied the coverage they need, but so that our economic future will not be compromised either.\ We'll have to root out fraud and overcharges and make sure that paperwork no longer chokes your doctor. We'll have to maintain the highest American standards and the right to choose and a system that is the world's finest for all those who can access it.\ But first we must make choices. We must choose to give the American people the quality they demand and deserve with a system that will not bankrupt the country or further drive more Americans into agony. Let me further say that I want to work with all of you on this. I realize this is a complicated issue, but we must address it.\ And I believe if there is any chance that Republicans and Democrats who disagree on taxes and spending or anything else could agree on one thing, surely we can all look at these numbers and go home and tell our people the truth. We cannot continue these spending patterns in public or private dollars for health care for less and less and less every year. We can do better. `Investment in children'\ Perhaps the most fundamental change the new direction I propose offers is its focus on the future and its investment which I seek in our children. Each day we delay really making a commitment to our children carries a dear cost. Half of the two-year olds in this country today don't receive the immunizations they need against deadly diseases. Our plan will provide them for every eligible child. And we know now that we will save ten dollars later for every one dollar we spend by eliminating preventible childhood diseases. That's a good investment no matter how you measure it.\ I recommend that the Women, Infants and Children's nutrition program be expanded so that every expectant mother who needs the help gets it.\ Head Start, a program that prepares children for school, is a success story. We all know that it saves money, but today it just reaches barely over a third of all the eligible children. Under this plan every eligible child will be able to get a head start.\ This is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do. For every dollar we invest today, we'll save three tomorrow. We have to start thinking about tomorrow. I've heard that somewhere before.\ We have to ask more in our schools of our students, our teachers, our principals, our parents. Yes, we must give them the resources they need to meet high standards, but we must also use the authority and the influence and the funding of the Education Department to promote strategies that really work in learning. Money alone is not enough; we have to do what really works to increase learning in our schools.\ We have to recognize that all of our high school graduates need some further education in order to be competitive in this global economy. So we have to establish a partnership between businesses and education and the government for apprenticeship programs in every state in this country to give our people the skills they need.\ Lifelong learning must benefit not just young high school graduates but workers, too, throughout their career. The average 18-year-old today will change jobs seven times in a lifetime. We have done a lot in this country on worker training in the last few years, but the system is too fractured. We must develop a unified, simplified, sensible, streamlined worker training program so that workers receive the training they need regardless of why they lost their jobs or whether they simply need to learn something new to keep them. We have got to do better on this. `National service'\ And finally, I propose a program that got a great response from the American people all across this country last year, a program of national service to make college loans available to all Americans, and to challenge them at the same time to give something back to their country, as teachers or police officers or community service workers; to give them the option to pay the loans back, but at tax time so they can't beat the bill, but to encourage them instead to pay it back by making their country stronger and making their country better and giving us the benefit of their talents.\ A generation ago, when President Kennedy proposed and the United States Congress embraced the Peace Corps, it defined the character of a whole generation of Americans committed to serving people around the world. In this national service program, we will provide more than twice as many slots for people before they go to college to be in national service than ever served in the Peace Corps. This program could do for this generation of members of Congress what the Land Grant College Act did and what the GI Bill did for former congressmen. In the future, historians who got their education through the national service loan will look back on you and thank you for giving America a new lease on life if you meet this challenge.\ If we believe in jobs and we believe in learning, we must believe in rewarding work. If we believe in restoring the values that make America special, we must believe that there is dignity in all work, and there must be dignity for all workers. To those who care for our sick, who tend our children, who do our most difficult and tiring jobs, the new direction I propose will make this solemn, simple commitment: by expanding the refundable earned income tax credit, we will make history; we will reward the work of millions of working poor Americans by realizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you've got a child in the house, you will no longer be in poverty.\ Later this year we offer a plan to end welfare as we know it. I have worked on this issue for the better part of a decade and I know from personal conversations with many people that no one -- no one -- wants to change the welfare system as badly as those who are trapped in it.\ I want to offer the people on welfare the education, the training, the child care, the health care they need to get back on their feet but say after two years they must get back to work, too, in private business if possible, in public service if necessary. We have to end welfare as a way of life and make it a path to independence and dignity. `Strengthen our families'\ Our next great goal should be strengthen our families. I compliment the Congress for passing the Family and Medical Leave Act as a good first step.\ But it is time to do more. This plan will give this country the toughest child support enforcement it has ever had. It has time to demand that people take responsibility for the child they bring into this world.\ And I ask you to help to protect our families against the violent crime which terrorizes our people and which our communities apart. We must pass a tough crime bill.\ I support not only the bill which didn't quite make it to the president's desk last year but also an initiative to put 100,000 more police officers on the street, to provide boot camps for first-time, non-violent offenders, for more space for the hardened criminals in jail.\ And I support an initiative to do what we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. I will make you this bargain: if you pass the Brady bill, I'll sure sign it.\ Let me say now -- we should move to the harder parts.\ I think it is clear to every American, including every member of Congress of both parties, that the confidence of the people who pay our bills in our institutions in Washington is not high. We must restore it. We must begin again to make government work for ordinary taxpayers not simply for organized interest groups, and that beginning must start with real political reform. I am asking the United States Congress to pass a real campaign finance reform bill this year.\ I ask you to increase the participation of the American people by passing the motor voter bill promptly.\ I ask you to deal with the undue influence of special interests by passing a bill to end the tax deductions for lobbying and to act quickly to require all the people who lobby you to register as lobbyists by passing the lobbying registration bill.\ Believe me, they were cheering that last section at home. I believe lobby reform and campaign finance reform are a sure path to increased popularity for Republicans and Democrats alike because it says to the voters back home, this is your House, this is your Senate, we're your hired hands, and every penny we draw is your money. `Live within our means'\ Next, to revolutionize government, we have to ensure that we live within our means, and that should start at the top and with the White House.\ In the last few days, I have announced a cut in the White House staff of 25 percent, saving approximately $10 million. I have ordered administrative cuts in budgets of agencies and departments, I have cut the federal bureaucracy, or will over the next four years, by approximately 100,000 positions, for a combined savings of $9 billion.\ It is time for government to demonstrate in the condition we're in that we can be as frugal as any household in America. And that's why I also want to congratulate the Congress. I noticed the announcement of the leadership today that Congress is taking similar steps to cut its costs. I think that is important, I think it will send a very clear signal to the American people.\ But if we really want to cut spending, we're going to have to do more, and some of it will be difficult. Tonight I call for an across-the-board freeze in federal government salaries for one year. And thereafter during this four-year period, I recommend that salaries rise at one point lower than the cost-of-living allowance normally involved in federal pay increases.\ Next I recommend that we make 150 specific budget cuts, as you know; and that all those who say we should cut more be as specific as I have been.\ Finally, let me say to my friends on both sides of the aisle, it is not enough simply to cut government. We have to rethink the whole way it works. When I became president, I was amazed at just the way the White House worked in ways that added lots of money to what taxpayers had to pay -- outmoded ways that didn't take maximum advantage of technology and didn't do things that any business would have done years ago to save taxpayers' money. `New spirt of innovation'\ So I want to bring a new spirit of innovation into every government department. I want to push education reform, as I said, not just to spend more money but to really improve learning. Some things work and some things don't. We ought to be subsidizing the things that work and discouraging the things that don't. I'd like to use that Superfund to clean up pollution for change and not just pay lawyers.\ In the aftermath of all the difficulties with the savings and loans, we must use federal bank regulators to protect the security and safety of our financial institutions but they should not be used to continue the credit crunch, to stop people from making sensible loans.\ I'd like for us to not only have welfare reform but to re-examine the whole focus of all of our programs that help people, to shift them from entitlement programs to empowerment programs. In the end, we want people not to need us anymore. I think that's important.\ But in the end, we have to get back to the deficit. For years, there's been a lot of talk about it but very few credible efforts to deal with it, and now I understand why, having dealt with the real numbers for four weeks. But I believe this plan does. It tackles the budget deficit seriously and over the long term. It puts in place one of the biggest deficit reductions and one of the biggest changes in federal priorities from consumption to investment in the history of this country at the same time over the next four years.\ Let me say to all the people watching us tonight who will ask me these questions beginning tomorrow as I go around the country and who've asked it in the past, we're not cutting the deficit just because experts say it's the thing to do or because it has some intrinsic merit. We have to cut the deficit because the more we spend paying off the debt, the less tax dollars we have to invest in jobs, in education and the future of this country.\ And the more money we take out of the pool of available savings, the harder it is for people in the private sector to borrow money at affordable interest rates for a college loan for their children, for a home mortgage, or to start a new business. That's why we've got to reduce the debt, because it is crowding out other activities that we ought to be engaged in and that the American people ought to be engaged in.\ We cut the deficit so that our children will be able to pay for a home, so that our companies can invest in the future and in retraining their workers so that our government can make the kinds of investments we need to be a stronger and smarter and safer nation.\ If we don't act now, you and I might not even recognize this government 10 years from now. If we just stay with the same trends of the last four years, by the end of the decade the deficit will be $635 billion a year, almost 80 percent of our gross domestic product, and paying interest on that debt will be the costliest government program of all. We'll still be the world's largest debtor, and when members of Congress come here they'll be devoting our 20 cents on the dollar to interest payments, more than half of the budget to health care and to other entitlements, and you'll come here and deliberate and argue over 6 or 7 cents on the dollar, no matter what America's problems are.\ We will not be able to have the independence we need to chart the future that we must, and we'll be terribly dependent on foreign funds for a large portion of our investment.\ This budget plan, by contrast, will by 1997 cut $140 billion in that year alone from the deficit, a real spending cut, a real revenue increase, a real deficit reduction, using the independent numbers of the Congressional Budget Office. `You can laugh, Republicans'\ Well, you can laugh, my fellow Republicans, but I'll point out that the Congressional Budget Office was normally more conservative in what was going to happen and closer to right than previous presidents have been.\ I did this so that we could argue about priorities with the same set of numbers; I did this so that no one could say I was estimating my way out of this difficulty; I did this because if we can agree together on the most prudent revenues we're likely to get -- if the recovery stays and we do right things economically, then it'll turn out better for the American than we say. In the last 12 years, because there were differences over the revenue estimates, you and I know that both parties were given greater elbow room for irresponsibility. This is tightening the rein on the Democrats as well as the Republicans. Let's at least argue about the same set of numbers so the American people will think we're shooting straight with them.\ As I said earlier, my recommendation makes more than 150 difficult reductions, to cut the federal spending by a total of $246 billion. We're eliminating programs that are no longer needed, such as nuclear power research and development.\ We're slashing subsidies and canceling wasteful projects. But many of these programs were justified in their time and a lot of them were difficult for me to recommend reductions in -- some really tough ones for me personally. I recommend that we reduce interest subsidies to the Rural Electric Administration. That's a difficult thing for me to recommend, but I think that I cannot exempt the things that exist in my state or in my experience if I ask you to deal with things that are difficult for you to deal with. We're going to have to have no sacred cows except the fundamental, abiding interest of the American people.\ I have to say that we all know our government has been just great at building programs. The time has come to show the American people that we can limit them, too, that we can not only start things, but we can actually stop things. `Responsibilities around world'\ About the defense budget, I raise a hope and a caution. As we restructure our military forces to meet the new threats of the post-Cold War world, it is true that we can responsibly reduce our defense budget. And we may all doubt what that range of reductions is, but let me say that as long as I am president, I will do everything I can to make sure that the men and women who serve under the American flag will remain the best trained, the best prepared, the best equipped fighting force in the world, and every one of you should make that solemn pledge. We still have responsibilities around the world, we are the world's only superpower, this is still a dangerous and uncertain time, and we owe it to the people in uniform to make sure that we adequately provide for the national defense and for their interests and needs.\ Backed by an effective national defense and a stronger economy, our nation will be prepared to lead a world challenged as it is everywhere by ethnic conflict, by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, by the global democratic revolution and by challenges to the health of our global environment.\ I know this economic plan is ambitious, but I honestly believe it is necessary for the continued greatness of the United States. And I think it is paid for fairly, first by cutting government, then by asking the most of those who benefited the most in the past and by asking more Americans to contribute today so that all of us can prosper tomorrow.\ For the wealthiest -- those earning more than $180,000 per year -- I ask you all who are listening tonight to support a raise in the top rate for federal income taxes from 31 to 36 percent. We recommend a ten percent surtax on incomes over $250,000 a year and we recommend closing some loopholes that some people get away without paying any tax at all.\ For businesses with taxable incomes in excess of $10 million, we recommend a raise in the corporate rate, also to 36 percent, as well as a cut in the deduction for business entertainment expenses.\ Our plan seeks to attack tax subsides that actually reward companies more for shutting their operations down here and moving them overseas than for staying here and reinvesting in America. I say that as someone who believes that American companies should be free to invest around the world and as a former governor who actively sought investment of foreign companies in my state. But the tax code should not express a preference to American companies for moving somewhere else and it does in particular cases today.\ We will seek to insure that through effective tax enforcement foreign corporations who do make money in America simply pay the same taxes that American companies make on the same income. `No cuts in Medicaid'\ To middle class Americans who have paid a great deal for the last 12 years and from whom I ask a contribution tonight, I will say again, as I did on Monday, you're not going alone any more -- you're certainly not going first, and you're not going to pay more for less as you have too often in the past.\ I want to emphasize the facts about this plan: 98.8 percent of America's families will have no increase in their income tax rates, only 1.2 percent at the top.\ Let me be clear. There will also be no new cuts in benefits for Medicare.\ As we move toward the fourth year with the explosion in health care costs, as I said, projected to account for 50 percent of the growth of the deficit between now and the year 2000, there must be plan cuts in payments to providers -- to doctors, to hospitals, to labs -- as a way of controlling health care costs, but I see these only as a stopgap until we can reform the entire health care system. If you'll help me do that, we can be fair to the providers and to the consumers of health care.\ Let me repeat this, because I know it matters to a lot of you on both sides of the aisle. This plan does not make a recommendation for new cuts in Medicare benefits for any beneficiary. Secondly, the only change we are making in Social Security is one that has already been publicized: the plan does ask older Americans with higher incomes who do not rely solely on Social Security to get by to contribute more. This plan will not affect the 80 percent of Social Security recipients who do not pay taxes on Social Security now. Those who do not pay tax on Social Security now will not be affected by this plan.\ Our plan does include a broad-based tax on energy. And I want to tell you why I selected this and why I think it's a good idea. I recommend that we adopt a BTU tax on the heat content of energy as the best way to provide us with revenue to lower the deficit, because it also combats pollution, promotes energy efficiency, promotes the independence economically of this country as well as helping to reduce the debt, and because it does not discriminate against any area. Unlike a carbon tax, it's not too hard on the coal states; unlike a gas tax, it's not too tough on people who drive a long way to work; unlike an ad valorem tax, it doesn't increase just when the price of an energy source goes up. And it is environmentally responsible; it will help us in the future as well as in the present with the deficit. `Courage to start building'\ Taken together, these measures will cost an American family with an income of about $40,000 a year less than $17 a month. It will cost American families with incomes under $30,000 nothing because of other programs we propose, principally those raising the earned income tax credit.\ Because of our publicly stated determination to reduce the deficit, if we do these things, we will see the continuation of what's happened just since the election. Just since the election, since the secretary of the Treasury, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and others have begun to speak out publicly in favor of a tough deficit reduction plan, interest rates have continued to fall, long-term. That means that for the middle class, who will pay something more each month, if they have any credit needs or demands, their increased energy costs will be more than offset by lower interest costs for mortgages, consumer loans, credit cards. This can be a wise investment for them and their country now.\ I would also point out what the American people already know, and that is, because we're a big, vast country where we drive long distances, we have maintained far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country. We will still have far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country, and these will be spread fairly, with real attempts to make sure that no cost is imposed on families with incomes under $30,000, and that the costs are very modest until you get into the higher income groups where the income taxes trigger in.\ Now I ask all of you to consider this. Whatever you think of the tax program, whatever you think of the spending cuts, consider the costs of not changing. Remember the numbers that you all know. If we just keep on doing what we're doing, by the end of the decade, we'll have a $650-billion-a-year deficit. If we just keep on doing what we're doing, by the end of the decade, 20 percent of our national income will go to health care every year, twice as much as any other country on the face of the globe. If we just keep on doing what we're doing, over 20 cents on the dollar will have to go to service the debt.\ Unless we have the courage now to start building our future and stop borrowing from it, we're condemning ourselves to years of stagnation, interrupted by occasional recessions, to slow growth in jobs, to no more growth in incomes, to more debt, to more disappointment. Unless we change, unless we increase investment and reduce the debt to raise productivity so that we can generate both jobs and incomes, we will be condemning our children and our children's children to a lesser life than we enjoyed.\ Once Americans looked forward to doubling their living standards every 25 years. At present productivity rates, it'll take a hundred years to double living standards, until our grandchildren's grandchildren are born. I say that is too long to wait. `Our people will be watching'\ Tonight the American people know we have to change. But they're also likely to ask me tomorrow and all of you for the weeks and months ahead whether we have the fortitude to make the changes happen in the right way. They know that as soon as I leave this chamber and you go home, various interest groups will be out in force lobbying against this or that piece of this plan and that the forces of conventional wisdom will offer a thousand reasons why we well ought to do this but we just can't do it.\ Our people will be watching and wondering -- not to see whether you disagree with me on a particular issue but just to see whether this is going to business as usual or a real new day -- whether we're all going to conduct ourselves as if we know we're working for them. We must scale the walls of the people's skepticism, not with our words but with our deeds.\ After so many years of gridlock and indecision, after so many hopeful beginnings and so few promising results, the American people are going to be harsh in their judgments of all of us if we fail to seize this moment. This economic plan can't please everybody. If the package is picked apart, there will be something that will anger each of us and won't please anybody. But if it taken as a whole, it will help all of us.\ So I ask you all to begin by resisting the temptation to focus only a particular spending cut you don't like or some particular investment that wasn't made -- and nobody likes the tax increases -- but let's just face facts. For 20 years through administrations of both parties, incomes have stalled and debt has exploded and productivity has not grown as it should. We cannot deny the reality of our condition. We have got to play the hand we were dealt and play it as best we can.\ My fellow Americans, the test of this plan cannot be what is in it for me; it has got to be what is in it for us.\ If we work hard and if we work together, if we rededicate ourselves to creating jobs, to rewarding work, to strengthening our families, to reinvesting our government, we can lift our country's fortunes again. Today I ask everyone in this chamber and every American to look simply into your heart, to spark your own hopes, to fire your own imagination. There is so much good, so much possibility, so much excitement in this country now that if we act boldly and honestly, as leaders should, our legacy will be one of prosperity and progress. This must be America's new direction. Let us summon the courage to seize it.\ Thank you. God bless America."
144,"Highways are often regarded as the ultimate example of user-financed government. Motorists pay a variety of fees, from state and federal taxes on fuel to titling and registration fees on vehicles, to pay for their construction and maintenance. But are roads truly self-sustaining? A new study says absolutely not.\Researcher Mark A. Delucchi of the University of California, Davis' Institute of Transportation Studies recently looked at the nation's total expenditures on roads and compared the result with the total collected in highway-related taxes and fees. The gap was substantial - the tax on a gallon of gas would have to be increased 20 to 70 cents per gallon to make driving a car a truly fee-for-service arrangement.\That's not necessarily to advocate for an immediate doubling or tripling of the gas tax, but policymakers need to reject the long-held myth that driving a car is not a heavily taxpayer-subsidized activity. This is a key point in the ongoing debate over whether to spend money on public transit or roads. Transit may be subsidized more overtly, but roads require their share of tax dollars, too.\And when broad societal costs are part of the equation and transit's energy efficiency and advantages to the environment are weighed, rail and bus travel looks like an even better bargain. The UC Davis study notes that if these kinds of nonmonetary factors are considered, the gas tax would have to be raised more than $1 per gallon to finance roads.\In this context, Gov. Martin O'Malley's proposal to raise nearly $400 million annually to invest in Maryland transportation projects - particularly with its projected fraction-of-a-cent gas tax increase next year - may simply be too modest in scope.\Count the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as among those favoring a tax increase on the federal level. The conservative business group has called for more to be spent on intercity passenger rail, transit systems and ports, all of which could be paid for by higher gas taxes or perhaps a ""carbon tax to address global warming."" Looking at the numbers, it's difficult not to agree."
145,"WASHINGTON - The Obama administration plans to push ahead with plans to aggressively limit greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming despite fears that the move could further slow the recessionary economy.\Instead of backing away, the administration plans to portray the limits as a boost for America's ""clean energy economy,"" according to congressional leaders and energy experts who have talked with top Obama advisers. The move would spur competitiveness and promote investment in renewable alternatives to imported oil, the government will argue.\At issue is the ""cap and trade"" initiative, under which the government would set limits on carbon emissions by power plants, factories and other installations but allow those who emit more to buy or trade permits with companies and facilities that emitted less than the prescribed limit.\The idea is that raising the cost of pumping more carbon into the atmosphere would encourage companies and other emitters to cut back, thus reducing a principal cause of global warming.\""If we don't put a price on carbon,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, ""we'll never get these clean energy sources online.""\But cap-and-trade would amount to a tax, raising energy costs. And several independent studies have suggested that emissions limits could be a drag on economic growth, a concern raised frequently by opponents of climate change legislation.\""The whole economic issue will be front and center in the debate on this, on both sides,"" said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, who has discussed Obama's global warming plans with senior administration officials.\Polls show voters increasingly losing interest in the global warming issue.\By pressing ahead anyway, Obama would be sticking with a program he said during the campaign would be a high priority of his presidency.\""There's a general consensus that things are going to be done with climate"" in Washington this year, said Daniel Yergin, the author of the Pulitzer-winning The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power, who recently updated his book with an epilogue on Obama and energy. He added: ""We're going to go through a very intense national seminar on cap and trade and carbon tax.""\Details of the administration's approach are far from set, though Obama has repeatedly said he favors ""cap and trade,"" allowing companies to buy and sell emissions permits. The administration will argue that greenhouse gas restrictions should be part of a two-pronged effort to stimulate renewable energy supplies and ensure demand for the megawatts they'd produce.\The first part is to invest heavily in wind power, solar power and biofuels, through the massive stimulus bill working its way through Congress. The second is to help that power compete with cheaper fossil fuels by pumping up their costs to reflect the potential economic damage from a warmed earth.\Critics, including many Republicans on Capitol Hill, say those moves will only increase energy prices and hurt already struggling families.\""I just have concerns on the impact on the economy with all of the issues of global climate change,"" said Sen. John A. Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who sits on the Senate's energy and environment committees, ""and what restrictions there's going to be, what expenses there's going to be for American taxpayers.""\Economists generally agree that limiting emissions is likely to curb economic growth, at least in the short term.\Peter Orszag, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office who now heads the White House Office of Management and Budget, told Congress last year that emissions limits would reduce long-term economic risks but ""also impose costs on the economy ... in the form of higher prices for energy and energy-intensive goods.""\Orszag also testified that the size of those costs could depend on whether the government sells emissions permits and if so, how it spends the proceeds. Environmentalists have recently pushed that idea one step further, arguing that if Congress passed emissions caps today, it could borrow against the future revenues from permit sales and spend the money on alternative energy research and technology.\That would stimulate the economy and ""allow polluters to transition from a high-polluting environment to a low-polluting environment,"" said Andy Stevenson, a former hedge fund manager who is now a finance adviser for the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.\Other experts are more skeptical. Subsidizing alternative energy could stimulate the economy, said Robert Shapiro, an economic adviser to President Bill Clinton who now chairs the U.S. Climate Task Force. But a cap-and-trade system, he said, ""would raise energy prices, at a time when you're trying to increase consumption. ... It goes against everything [Obama] campaigned on.""\Shapiro and many economists would prefer for the government to tax carbon emissions and refund the proceeds straight to taxpayers. The Democratic leaders working with Obama on climate legislation prefer cap-and-trade. So do a coalition of business leaders, including Shell Oil and the Big Three automakers, who joined with some environmental groups to release an emissions-limit proposal this month.\Boxer said Friday that she's learned from the defeat of a cap-and-trade bill in the Senate last year. She's set to unveil basic principles of a simpler, more focused plan next week, in hopes of passing a bill by year's end.\Her counterpart on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat, talks even more optimistically: He has promised a bill by Memorial Day.\Credit: Tribune Washington Bureau"
146,"CORRECTION\ A list of President-elect Bill Clinton's commitments in yesterday's Sun should have stated that a Clinton administration would redirect more than $60 billion from defense cuts over four years.\ The Sun regrets the errors.\ President-elect Bill Clinton made many commitments to voters en route to his election Tuesday. Here - from A to Z - are some of the policies Mr. Clinton has said he plans to implement in his administration after he becomes the nation's 42nd chief executive on Jan. 20.\ ABORTION: Promises to sign a Freedom of Choice Act. Would repeal ""gag"" rule barring federally financed clinics from counselling pregnant women about abortion.

Plans to bolster International Atomic Energy Agency's capacity to carry out surprise inspections in member countries. Would use sanctions against countries and companies spreading dangerous weapons. Demands all nations tighten arms export laws and strengthen enforcement of nuclear weapons policies. Ensure agricultural and non-military loans are used as intended and keep key technology and equipment out of reach of dictators (see Defense, China, Russia, Israel/Middle East, Yugoslavia).\ ARTS: Would continue federal funding of the arts (see X-ratings).\ BUREAUCRACY: Will cut the White House staff by 25 percent.

147," Gas Tax\ I was several paragraphs into John Shlaes' letter (April 12) about the carbon tax before I realized that his Global Climate Coalition might better be called the ""Gas Guzzler Coalition.""\ The following quote speaks for itself: ""The latest data indicates {sic} that warming temperatures will not lead to a rise in sea level, in part because the warming would occur primarily at night.""\ Does he think that global warming is a night-time phenomenon? Some of his other comments are equally questionable and almost as amusing.\ He is correct that a carbon tax would mean higher prices for fuels such as oil and gas; that's the point of the tax.\ The tax would also mean the introduction of efficient market forces to make our economy use these fuels more effectively.\ That would represent a long-term benefit to our economy, our environment and all of us. Rob Bonney Pasadena\ National Debt\ Harry B. Howe's April 13 letter disputes my contention that Social Security benefits are, indeed, income.\ My Funk & Wagnall's defines income as ""amount of money coming in"" -- which would certainly seem to include Social Security checks.\ Obviously, Mr. Howe believes that half the benefits he receives were already taxed once and that ""it is the same as if you put money in a bank account.""\ Why is it that when I put money in the bank, I am not allowed to withdraw anything beyond what I put in, plus a little taxable interest?\ My bank will not let me continue to withdraw money for as long as I live. It will not allow my surviving spouse to keep on drawing money until her demise.\ It will not pay me benefits during my working years, if I should become disabled. It does not pay survivor benefits to my dependents. Nor dies it try to protect me during my retirement years from the ravages of inflation with regular cost-of-living adjustments.\ Social Security does all of these things -- and it continues to do them long after I and the vast majority of retirees have exhausted the amount initially paid into the system.\ Mr. Howe may feel comfortable in bequeathing a $16,000 debt to each of his grandchildren, which is growing.\ But I (and, I hope, many other seniors) would be willing to try to live within my means, sacrificing a little, in order that our children and grandchildren might enjoy some of the benefits we did, rather than struggle with the burden resulting from our irresponsible selfishness. F. van Dommelen Denton\ White Males\ In Wayne Hardin's April 12 article, Dr. Charles T. Lo Presto attempts to paint all white males as frustrated, mad individuals who are going off the deep end.\ He bases this assumption on a movie, ""Falling Down,"" in which Michael Douglas, facing some life failures, shoots up the town.\ As David Letterman said about Dan Quayle's remarks about the Murphy Brown episode, ""It's just a movie, Charles, it's make believe.""\ His attempt to psychoanalyze the entire white male population on the basis of a movie theme is laughable.\ Dr. Larry Iacarino states that "". . . white males are starting to feel oppressed and will be held down the same way women and minorities were held down."" Do you have any data to support that hypothesis?\ Why do you single out white males? Are you aware of the ""us killing us is genocide"" theme being sung in the black community?\  General Dynamics, IBM, Westinghouse and numerous airlines have laid off thousands of people from very high-paying jobs. Can you cite one instance where one of these workers behaved as Michael Douglas had in the movie?\ Don't you guys think white males are capable of dealing with adversity? If you don't, try reading your history books. Julius G. Angelucci Severna Park\ Human Cowardice\ M. Catherine Kennedy writes about genetic engineering (April 5) that ""it is wrong to experiment with a product that will affect a significant number of people (and animals and plants) when the results for good or ill cannot be predicted.""\ What if Wilbur and Orville Wright had foreseen that airplanes would become weapons of mass destruction in World War II?\ What if Benjamin Franklin had known how many people would die of electrocution?\ What if our early ancestors, inventing the wheel, had guessed how many people would crash in automobiles or be burned to death by fire?\ Should these people all have given up their work in the name of kindness to humanity? Any technology will have good effects and ill effects.\ More Americans die every year from automobile accidents than died in the Vietnam war. Yet we choose to continue driving these dangerous vehicles because we think the benefits outweigh the dangers.\ Pharmaceuticals save a great many lives every year. The development of every pharmaceutical is a trial-and-error process. We test new drugs on animals because we don't know what the results will be. Many animals die.\ But if we halted the animal testing of drugs, or the development of new drugs, we would be condemning many of our own to dysfunction, pain and premature death.\ The challenge of being human, in technology as in anything else, is to guide our actions with intelligence. To say we should give up because of the dangers is not an act of kindness, but of cowardice. Philip Goetz Ellicott City"

In Dominion's full-page ad (The Capital, Feb. 21), their chief environmentalist supports their Cove Point proposal to liquefy natural gas for export as having the ""right balance"" with renewables for energy production, stating that natural gas (methane) is better than coal.
\
However, Mike Tidwell (mtidwell@chesapeakeclimate.org) and Bill McKibben (350.org) show that even though methane, when burned, produces less carbon dioxide than coal, leakage to the atmosphere in the drilling and transportation process makes the overall impact on global warming worse than coal because methane has 20 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide.
\
Also, not mentioned, are the negative impact of fracking for natural gas - the use and waste of large volumes of water by adding chemicals that poison the environment and local water supplies, and the heavy truck traffic moving equipment and supplies, ruining country roads and disturbing the peace.
\
At the rally opposing Cove Point in Baltimore on Feb. 20 organized by the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, Sierra Club and others, speakers raised these points, including Del. Heather Mizeur, the candidate for governor endorsed by environmental organizations. With extreme weather events accelerating, every effort should be made quickly to switch to clean energy and leave fossil fuels in the ground, including natural gas.
\
The best way to do this is to implement a carbon tax (with the proceeds going to the people), which will make fossil fuel more expensive than clean energy and provide the financial incentive to invest more in clean energy - and create many more new jobs. For now, tell Gov. Martin O' Malley to veto Dominion's Cove Point project.

"
149,"French President Nicolas Sarkozy is showing the Bush administration how to be a conservative for conservation.\With former Vice President Al Gore at his side, the center-right French leader, whom President Bush regards as something of a kindred spirit, unveiled last week a sweeping program of environmental measures meant to catapult France into the forefront of the fight to curb global warming.\His proposal is not sweeping enough to quiet skeptics, or even to catch up with European neighbors. But it's bolder than much of what's on the books in this country, and sets an example for Mr. Bush and other conservatives that protecting the Earth's resources should not be an exclusive exercise for liberals.\France is already ahead of the United States because it has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by specific deadlines. Mr. Sarkozy, speaking at the conclusion of a lengthy conference among activists, farmers, unions, businesses and government officials, outlined a campaign to achieve these goals that he called ""an ecological New Deal.""\He wants to phase out incandescent light bulbs, fortify drafty buildings and charge extra for driving gas-guzzlers - even beyond the rising cost of gas. He proposes to drastically scale back highway construction while expanding high-speed rail service with another 1,200 miles of tracks.\Mr. Sarkozy stopped short of endorsing a controversial carbon tax on goods and services that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, though he urged a study of the issue. He also disappointed some environmental groups by refusing to reverse France's reliance on nuclear energy, arguing that the fight against climate change can't be won without it.\But the showcase he gave to the global warming issue was nonetheless much more than hot air. Perhaps most meaningful was that this dynamic new leader, who has quite a flair for the spotlight, considers protecting the environment - in deeds as well as words - a popular cause.\Mr. Bush and the lawmakers of both parties in Congress who have their doubts would be well advised to take his cue."
150,"We are very pleased with this year's public service messages about using crosswalks in Ocean City.\This awareness campaign has probably already saved lives and prevented countless accidents and near-misses. While driving down Coastal Highway, however, it becomes clear many of the public beach access points do not actually align with the controlled intersections nor do they have crosswalk markings.\These are obvious temptations to jaywalk and should be corrected.\As a related problem, most of the controlled intersections that have ""push to cross"" buttons are not well-coordinated. In fact, at most intersections, the buttons do not control both crosswalks, creating a situation where one corner has ""Don't Walk"" while the adjacent corner has ""Walk."" It would be simpler if pressing any of the four ""push to cross"" buttons would activate both sides to cross Coastal Highway at the same time.\Anything we do to encourage safe crossing will save lives, and these small additional steps should be a high priority for the town of Ocean City.\Climate change evidence scarce\We can debate whether humans cause climate change in terms of who wrote the reports, the accuracy of the climate models and who is doing the studies. We can look at motivations scientists have to conclude the Earth is getting warmer and it is man's fault because he burns coal and oil. We can debate whether scientists' funding was dependent on the research conclusions.\In the 1960s, Paul Ehrlich's ""The Population Bomb"" predicted mass starvation in the 1970s and '80s. In the '70s, according to Time magazine, we were running out of petroleum and ""global cooling"" was coming. In the '80s, it was ozone depletion. As soon as freon was outlawed, we heard nothing more about the ozone hole. In 1988, actor Ted Danza predicted the oceans would be polluted in 10 years. In the 1990s, we had a ""global warming"" scare. Now it's ""man-caused climate change."" Soon after the East Anglia ""global warming"" emails were leaked, the term ""global warming"" was changed to ""climate change.""\I have been living on waterfront property for 31 years. I have not yet seen a sea level rise of an inch. The Earth has had climate change countless times in its 4.5 billion-year life, when man wasn't around. If carbon dioxide is heating the planet, how could it also cause cooling and storms?\Why are the same environmentalists who promoted clean-burning natural gas now fabricating a false scenario in which ""fracking"" for natural gas extraction pollutes groundwater? Show me one polluted well. Why do the same people who find fault with windmills and solar panels also complain that forestland and endangered species are threatened by these units?\If the environment is of great concern, why did President Barack Obama guarantee Brazil, a country with few environmental laws, money for offshore drilling? Common sense dictates an agenda behind motivating Americans to reduce CO2 emissions and energy usage. What is it?\Environmental issues are being used to extort more money from us in the form of a carbon tax, which we are now paying in our electric bills. More importantly, those who want to turn us into a socialist nation use environmental destruction to stop us from extracting our vast energy supply.\Bankrupt the nation, reduce our energy, kill capitalism, build a dependency class, promote class envy and presto: You have a socialist country. We are halfway there now.\Trash fee proposal is an outrage\It has been proposed at a board meeting of Ocean Pines that the trash collection fees be added to our yearly assessment. This is the most outrageous idea yet.\I will pay my bill quarterly, as I have been doing, and do not need any further additions to our rising homeowner association fees.\This idea is definitely not for the homeowners' benefit.\ID_Code: A7-307180003"
151,"With the revised route for the Keystone XL pipeline having last week won approval from Nebraska's Republican governor, the geology of North America's most controversial energy project is clear: It has landed President Barack Obama between a rock and a hard place.\Having campaigned for an ""all of the above"" energy policy but also having announced that addressing climate change will be a top priority during his second term, President Obama must choose between enabling TransCanada's petroleum exports and preventing what climatologists fear will quickly provide a huge and disastrous new boost in greenhouse gases. \Still, the decision may not be so difficult if Mr. Obama sticks to one guiding principle: What is in the best interests of the United States -- the jobs associated with construction of the multibillion-dollar project, or the risks posed by climate change and enabling greater global addiction to petroleum from a particularly troubling source? \On that basis, the risks far outweigh the rewards. The U.S. State Department should reject the project simply out of concern for the health, safety and security of U.S. citizens. Rising sea levels, severe storms, droughts and the risk posed to agriculture, and the potential for political disruption on a world scale all are associated with global warming. \And make no mistake, the Keystone pipeline is not just another incremental step in petroleum distribution. The crude oil would come from Canadian tar sands, the dirtiest possible source of petroleum, according to a 2012 Congressional Research Service study. Burning tar sands oil is bad enough, but even extracting it is highly polluting. \It's all very well for political leaders to decry the excess carbon emissions that are slowly raising the temperature of this planet, but that trend won't reverse unless the line is drawn somewhere. Surely, a project like Keystone -- which is not even expected to help U.S. consumers by reducing domestic gasoline or heating oil prices -- is a reasonable place to start. \Of course, such a choice is going to raise quite a hue and cry from the petroleum industry and its friends in Congress. But it's amusing to note that many of those same companies are not shy in raising the climate-change issue when it comes to promoting domestic natural gas, which burns far cleaner than coal. \Other critics will play the ""E"" cards and rail against the president for not putting the economy and energy independence first. Yet how much good Keystone does either is doubtful, particularly if enabling (if not expanding) global dependence on oil greatly harms this nation's growing green energy producers. \Don't want to rely on oil from the Middle East and other less-than-dependable sources? The country has already ratcheted down that reliance in recent years, and the secret is to both increase U.S. drilling where appropriate and to burn less oil, either through conservation (such as requiring greater energy efficiency) or by expanding use of renewable energy. \Climate change is not some far-off, theoretical threat. Its effects are real and already being felt. Has anyone noticed this week's stunningly volatile weather pattern? Experts say we can expect a lot more of that -- along with disastrous weather like superstorm Sandy, which is already costing the country tens of billions of dollars. That experience alone should have taught Congress what is at stake in the climate change debate. \The fact that there continue to be so many climate change deniers in the Republican-controlled House simply underscores the need for President Obama to take action when and where he can. The Keystone decision is his administration's alone, and politics ought not enter a decision-making process that should be governed by science and the facts. \Will he take some heat? Absolutely, but if the president's committed to pushing for controversial remedies to climate change like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade law, he will have a tough time explaining how he could have first approved a project like Keystone that is so harmful to the environment. Besides, polls show the public wants action on climate change, and that could help Democrats in 2014. Mr. Obama put off the Keystone decision last year and won re-election handily, a sign that TransCanada doesn't drive public opinion in this country now or in 2014.\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
152,"Polls show most Maryland residents recognize that climate change is a man-made disaster in the making. Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, has certainly acknowledged that. And so have the Democrats running the General Assembly. Yet there's clearly been some backsliding in the effort to reverse it. A decade ago, Maryland was viewed as a leader in the nation's war on climate change. Today, it's more like a decent, well-meaning, middle-of-the-pack ally.\Now that the election of Joe Biden as president and the United States has formally returned the country to the Paris climate agreement, the time is ripe for the state to set a more ambitious target. At some level, Gov. Hogan and Democrats in Annapolis would seem in agreement. The Hogan administration wants to see greenhouse gas emissions reduced by 50% by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2045. Legislation pending before the General Assembly, the Climate Solutions Now Act of 2021, seeks that same net zero target.\The difference is that the version moving through the state Senate is significantly more ambitious in the short term, with a goal of reducing emissions by 60% from 2006 levels and planting 5 million trees by 2030. And it anticipates a greater policy input from low-income and minority communities, groups often more negatively impacted by air pollution.\If all this seems quite reasonable, there's a reason for that - it is. Yet, environmentalists fear that some in the State House do not quite grasp the urgency. As Sen. Paul Pinsky, the lead sponsor of the Senate bill, has pointed out, the Hogan administration's talk about climate tends to surpass its actions. Note for example, that the governor's climate bill, House Bill 1362, was submitted several weeks past the legislative deadline (and yet little changed from a bill the administration offered one year ago).\More broadly, it's not hard to see the issue being lost in the more pressing concerns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet climate change poses the bigger long-term danger to the health and well-being of the state. Rising sea level alone represents an existential threat for many living in low-lying areas, with Chesapeake Bay waters projected to be two feet higher by 2050. Even now, places like Dorchester County on the Eastern Shore are more frequently getting flooded, their farm fields ruined by the intrusion of brackish water. By the end of the 21st century, experts fear the bay could be a 3.7 feet higher, which means a lot of coastal towns could be wiped out in a storm well before that moment. There's just so much sea walls can hold back.\Lawmakers need to take this seriously. Those who claim Maryland risks job losses if tougher emissions standards are pursued have it exactly wrong. The far greater danger is in doing nothing. How many jobs are lost when whole communities are flooded? When drinking water supplies are lost? When farms are ruined? When weather becomes more extreme? When human health suffers as ground-level ozone increases? Maryland, a coastal state, is at greater risk than much of the country. It ought to be a leader in finding solutions.\Providing career opportunities for displaced fossil fuel industry workers is a worthy goal. It ought to be part of the plan. So should ending policies that give tax credits to companies that burn trash to create power. But the single most important element in Maryland's response is to reduce emissions and increase offsets, like with trees that absorb carbon dioxide. Mr. Hogan has sought a 50% reduction by 2030. That's just not good enough. Not when Maryland is so vulnerable. And certainly not when Mr. Hogan's own Department of the Environment recognizes that the move away from greenhouse gas emissions would be a net jobs creator.\We would urge the Maryland Senate to give final approval to Senate Bill 414 and for the House of Delegates to follow suit with House Bill 583. The state is certainly capable of meeting these targets. Last Tuesday, the state's largest school system committed to becoming the nation's largest operator of electric school buses, a climate-friendly choice that already significantly boosts Maryland toward its emissions goal. A Maryland League of Conservation Voters poll found that at least two-thirds of voters statewide favor such measures as requiring new homes to be emissions free, requiring utilities to use renewable energy only and billing fossil fuel companies a carbon tax. And those are among the most controversial policies. Simply moving faster toward tougher emissions standards should be an easy call. And it should be approved right now.\Caption: People canoe through a flooded Fells Point after Tropical Storm Isabel in 2003. Polls show broad support in Maryland for taking action against climate change. Kim Hairston/Baltimore Sun"
153,"Pope Francis' message on climate change\After reading your recent article about Pope Francis' address to Congress, I was heartened by his focus on overcoming partisanship (""Pope Francis urges unity in address to Congress,"" Sept. 24). \His message of unity seemingly struck a chord with the members of Congress who discussed the address and what it meant to them afterward. \Among the many responses was a Facebook post by Rep. Elijah Cummings in which he implored fellow lawmakers, ""may the pope's words serve as a reminder to all of my colleagues that we do not legislate in a vacuum, and we do not legislate for a day or a week. We are legislating for generations yet unborn."" \Mr. Cummings is right and there are many Republicans who agree with him. Just last week, 11 Republicans introduced the Gibson resolution, which acknowledges the urgency of the climate crisis and calls on Congress to take action. \Now is the time for Congress to respond to climate change with socially just and economically beneficial policies. A carbon fee and dividend is the most direct, fair and politically possible path forward. I hope our representatives seize on the inclusivity and momentum brought by the pope's visit to introduce this common sense legislation. \Taylor Smith-Hams, Baltimore \Carbon tax offers opportunity \The pope has spoken on climate change (""At UN, Pope beseeches world leaders to protect environment,"" Sept. 25). Can our elected leaders chart a political path to solve the problem? \After talking individually with the offices of 175 members of Congress, our organization believes there is a centrist approach that can earn bipartisan cooperation. We should put the free market to work by creating a carbon fee to reduce emissions. To make it pro-growth, use half the revenue from that fee to drop the corporate tax rate, the highest in the industrial world, from 35 to 25 percent. Most of the other revenue could go to low- and middle-income Americans to protect them from slightly higher energy prices. Encourage global adoption with a border tax adjustment. \Pricing carbon works. British Columbia passed a revenue-neutral carbon fee and reduced emissions while growing faster than any other province in Canada. \William C. Eacho, Washington, D.C. \The writer is co-founder of Partnership for Responsible Growth. \Obama and the pope \Somewhat lost in the reporting on the papal visit was the welcoming address President Barack Obama gave on the White House lawn. \We know that the president is a great orator, but it is important to listen to the well-thought-out content of his speeches. \In his welcome, the president noted the moral authority of the pope and went on to describe the character traits of this particular pope which have resonated with Catholics and non-Catholics alike. \Mr. Obama took the occasion to acknowledge the contributions of American Catholics collectively and individually since the beginning of our nation. The work of Catholics in education, health care as well as outreach to the poor and marginalized was duly noted. \I appreciate the fact that Mr. Obama acknowledged these contributions during this historical visit. Hopefully today's Catholics will be encouraged to follow in the footsteps of our ancestors by continuing to engage in works that improve our communities. \Edward McCarey McDonnell, Baltimore \Do seniors not deserve health care? \I almost missed reading the article in The Sun's Health and Style Section thinking the ""mature"" couple enjoying the sun and the wind were advertising some vacation site (""Silver lining of old age: Ditching the screenings,"" Sept. 24). However, once I read Judy Peres' article, the take-away message for me was no more maintenance and surveillance, eat what you will as you are at the sundown of your life. \If one was talking automobiles, given the oversimplification of comparing the human body to cars, this would translate to: just keep fueling up and keep on running until you cannot run any more. Well, if this philosophy prevailed 50 years ago, would we have the extended average life expectancy we have today? \Quite frankly, I feel the writer may have been reporting from press releases and putting a favorable spin on the subject for the graying population to not have costly testing procedures that may require more expensive treatment. Could the researchers referenced in the column be receiving remuneration from insurance companies and governmental agencies out to discourage spending on the tests and therapies as cost containment for the elderly? \Fred Magaziner\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
154,"Maryland lawmakers would charge fees on fossil fuels and high-emissions vehicles to reduce pollution within the state - and send the first $350 million annually to fund schools - under a bill in the state's General Assembly.\HB33, the Climate Crisis and Education Act, cross-filed with SB76, would require the state to reduce its carbon emissions from 2006 by 60% by 2030 and reach net zero carbon emissions by 2045.\Beginning July 31, 2022, all fossil fuels brought into Maryland for burning and all new high-emission vehicles sold or registered within the state would incur a fee, according to the bill.\These companies wouldn't be allowed to pass these fees on to their customers, according to a legislative analysis.\Brian Smith, a lobbyist for the Washington Gas utility, said companies won't be able to sustain those costs if they are not passed down to their customers.\""If companies could recover the fees, the cost to customers would be huge,"" Smith testified in opposition of the bill.\Smith conducted a test, based on the impact of the proposed carbon tax on Maryland natural gas customers using 2018-2019 figures.\He found that residential rates would increase by 7.4% and commercial rates would increase by 8.8%. The average household would pay about $250 more annually for natural gas by 2031 should the bill pass, Smith told lawmakers.\Sen. Benjamin Kramer, D-Montgomery, Senate sponsor of the bill, said it would directly target companies negatively impacting the state's environment.\""Let's go to the source and say it's time for you all to start paying the costs of your destruction to the climate,"" Kramer told Capital News Service.\Similar legislation, the Climate Solution Now Act of 2021 (SB0414 and HB0583) - which also would require emissions goals of zero by 2045, a look toward disadvantaged communities to benefit from the legislation, and mandate extensive tree planting - advanced out of a Maryland Senate committee this week.\Anthony Field, Chesapeake Climate Action Network campaign coordinator, said that these bills complement each other and bring climate change forward as an intersectional issue.\""It's something that affects our public health and the solutions we come up with to address the climate crisis affecting the economy and jobs,"" Field said.\""Climate change is at the forefront of legislators' minds, I think there's a lot of pressure on the legislators to take meaningful action,"" he added.\The fees would be used toward several new state funds: a Kirwan Commission Fund, a Household and Employer Benefit Fund and a Climate Crisis Infrastructure Fund.\A Kirwan Commission Fund, used to pay for mandated improvements to Maryland's public education system, would receive the first $350 million annually from the carbon emission fees, according to the fiscal analysis.\John King Jr., former U.S. secretary of education under the Obama Administration, said this bill will help combat funding disparities between school districts.\""We have significant education funding gaps between our highest need communities and our wealthier communities,"" King said.\Half the revenue from the emission fees will be used toward a Household and Employer Benefit Fund, which would ensure through a rebate program that low-income households and businesses won't be affected by higher energy costs, according to the bill.\The rest of the emission fees, as well as fees collected from new high-emission vehicle sales and registrations, would be used toward the Climate Crisis Infrastructure Fund.\This fund will invest in clean energy programs, purchase electric transit and bus fleets and more.\Kirk McCauley, director of member and government relations for the Washington, Maryland, Delaware Service Station and Automotive Repair Association, testified in opposition to the bill because of the financial burden it would have on small businesses.\""Everything we do will be more expensive, every item delivered to a retailer will be more expensive,"" McCauley said during a Senate committee hearing on Feb 2.\Independent businesses - gas stations, convenience stores and propane distributors - wouldn't be able to financially sustain the carbon taxes and would also face bankruptcy, he added.\Non-transportation fuels would be charged $15 per ton of carbon emitted and would increase to $60 by 2031, and transportation fuels would be charged $10 per ton and would increase to $37 by 2031.\State revenues are expected to increase by $674.1 million in the 2023 fiscal year from the emission fees, according to the fiscal analysis.\The revenues are expected to increase annually, reaching an estimated $1.4 billion by fiscal year 2026, the bill states.\Up to 5 percent of all revenues could be allocated toward state agencies' administration costs to implement the new emission requirements, according to the fiscal analysis.\State expenditures would increase by $10 million in fiscal year 2022 to cover the combined administrative costs, which reflect technology costs and the need for a 120-person staff, according to the fiscal analysis.\Local governments and small businesses will be impacted starting in fiscal year 2023 due to higher energy and gas prices.\This legislation has been heard before the House Economic Matters Committee and the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee but has yet to receive a vote.\Capital News Service is part of the Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park."
155," Two days after Bill and Robin Hembree put a solar-electricity rig on their roof last month, they went outside and looked at the BGE meter.\ Inside the house, lights and the fridge were on. But the little wheel in the glass case was frozen, which meant BGE wasn't getting a 72 percent markup on these kilowatts. Sometimes it moved backward, which meant BGE was paying the Hembrees instead of vice versa.\ The Hembrees, who live in Severna Park with their two boys, have opted for the most extreme solution to electric-rate shock, short of living in a tent and bathing in the Chesapeake. To reduce pollution along with their Baltimore Gas & Electric bills, they spent $30,000 on the kind of hardware that powers NASA space probes.\ Time will tell whether, as ""early adopters"" of technology, they bought the equivalent of a cell phone in 1985 (an expensive gadget that became cheap and ubiquitous) or a Betamax video recorder in 1976 (an expensive gadget that didn't).\ Let's root for the cell phone.\ Solar energy, the hope of greenies for three decades, needs to become more than a novelty power source. But it requires research, luck, government assistance and many more customers like the Hembrees.\ Solar power has two big problems. First, it requires users to prepay for decades of energy. The Hembrees' $30,000 financed juice that was burned over Thanksgiving and juice that won't be used until 2030. Most families can't afford, or don't want to make, that kind of investment.\ The second problem is that, on a per-year, per-kilowatt basis, solar electricity is still much more expensive than BGE or other ""grid"" power. If you account for iffy Maryland sunshine (which reduces output over the life of the equipment) and the fact that the $30,000 could otherwise have been invested in Treasury bonds, the Hembrees are paying more than twice the standard BGE price (up 72 percent) that everybody is so upset about.\ Buying in bulk gets you discounts at Costco, but not, so far, in the solar-energy bazaar. (Even though they sometimes sell electricity back to BGE, the Hembrees' array doesn't erase their utility electricity bill; it just sharply reduces it.)\ Solar power is increasing, but it's a teeny piece of Maryland's energy output.\ Since July 1, the Maryland Energy Administration's grants for solar energy installations have grown to 87, nearly triple the number in the comparable period last year, says program manager Tim LaRonde. The Hembrees got $3,000 from the state, reducing their out- of-pocket cost from $33,000.\ ""We're growing,"" says Isaac Opalinsky, sales manager for Aurora Energy of Annapolis, which installed the Hembrees' system. ""We're doing more. We have more customers. We're seeing people purchase larger systems.""\ Two years ago, Aurora had three or four employees at any given time; now it has five to seven, he said.\ Long and high may these kinds of numbers increase. Private- sector money is pouring into solar. BP Solar's Frederick factory, which made the Hembrees' hardware, just announced a $70 million, 70- job expansion. Across the industry, engineers are figuring how to make more electrons with thinner pieces of photovoltaic silicon.\ All this will continue to lower costs. In 1987, the Frederick plant employed 400 people working one year to produce one megawatt of solar-cell capacity. Now it employs 550 to produce 100 megawatts a year, says Jean P. Posbic, BP Solar's director of product development.\ But the momentum may not be enough to push solar out of the quasi- hobby category. The time is now for a big increase in government incentives for solar power.\ The federal tax code should boost solar credits, and Maryland should raise the size and number of its alternative-energy grants. Maryland should also require BGE and other utilities to pay peak prices for electricity made during peak hours by the Hembrees and other home generators. Now they get a lower rate that doesn't reflect the full value of kilowatts fed to the grid in high-demand times.\ Even free-market economists (including Greg Mankiw, former adviser to President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers) back a carbon tax that would reflect the full, environmental cost of fossil energy and make renewable energy more competitive.\ What? More corporate welfare? For another industry? Favored by Hancock, the corporate welfare scold?\ Yep, but electric solar isn't just any industry. It's one of Maryland's few manufacturing sectors that is adding jobs. It's more promising and less polluting than ethanol, shale-oil and other alternatives. It might help keep the economy from playing energy hostage to a deteriorating Middle East or cooking itself in a cloud of carbon dioxide.\ Since it began working Nov. 22, the Hembrees' array has stopped 81 pounds of CO2 from issuing from a coal or gas generator that otherwise would be powering their home, the equipment's software says.\ ""We know that energy prices are pretty much going to continue to climb,"" says Robin Hembree. ""And we figured we could hopefully get a return on our investment and help the environment at the same time.""\ More Hembrees, fewer Humvees, is my new motto.\ jay.hancock@baltsun.com\ Credit: Sun Columnist"

A recent episode of the popular TV drama ""House"" centered on the psychological phenomenon of human hysteria. In the show, people were led to believe certain physical symptoms indicated the presence of a serious illness and, true to human nature, many people then began to experience them exactly as described. While it was greatly exaggerated, the show was entertaining and provocative in its portrayal of human suggestibility.
\
In that context, and with the celebration of Earth Day just a few days ago, it would seem like a good time to consider what appears to be a growing alarmism about climate change, or human-generated global warming. Recently, some people have even attributed storms and other normal weather phenomenon to global warming, and dire predictions have been made about the future. However, even though pretty much everyone agrees that we need to be good stewards of Earth and environmental awareness may be at an all time high, there still appear to be many significant, unanswered questions about the entire concept of climate change.
\
Contrary to the media and political blitz that seems to be promoting an unquestioned acceptance of global warming and human contributions to it, there are many quiet, if not silenced, scientific opinions that raise some legitimate concerns about the accuracy of these ""conclusions."" Unfortunately, rather than hearing an open dialogue about the issue, with information from all points of view being discussed, it seems as if anyone who raises a question at all is now labeled as ""anti-environment,"" stupid or in cahoots with ""big oil"" money. Even scientists with a different opinion have commented that it is difficult to voice their views openly, perhaps forcing even reticent people onto the global warming bandwagon.
\
On the financial front, global warming is now a multibillion- dollar industry with clear intentions of becoming even bigger. As one scientist said, ""If you want to study the mating habits of squirrels in Samoa and you want funding, you better apply for it under the name, 'A study of the mating habits of squirrels in Samoa and how it relates to global warming.' "" Imagine the intoxicating power of the ramped-up attention, influence and money that this topic has given to an entire field of study, including universities, researchers, environmental groups, political movements and other agenda-focused organizations.
\
Many of the recommendations which are being floated about as to how to best respond to this issue are not insignificant. They include raising taxes precipitously, charging a ""carbon tax,"" or requiring people and businesses to buy ""carbon credits"" for the emission of carbon dioxide. They also involve curtailing or eliminating many activities which we normally engage in, ranging from restricting the use of private vehicles to eliminating outdoor barbecuing. Most experts have predicted a drastic negative impact on our economy and lifestyle if these types of strategies are enacted, and many scientists have questioned whether these changes would have any significant impact on the issue at all.
\
Before we lose our sense of perspective or delve into unnecessary alarmism, it would make sense to gather enough data to make solid conclusions as to whether or not Earth is warming beyond the natural cycles of warming and cooling, and if it is, why? A whole second level of discussion would involve reasonably deciding what, if anything, we can realistically do that would actually make a difference.
\
Researching the various aspects of this issue reveals quite a bit of uncertainty as to what is actually happening on our planet. From a layperson's perspective, finding answers to some of the following questions might help clarify the matter. Specifically:
\
Do ice core samples which date back thousands of years show that higher levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) actually follow rather than precede earth warming, indicating that CO2 it is not a causal factor at all, but is actually a result of warming?
\
As the earth warms, do the oceans release more carbon dioxide, which is why the ice core samples show higher CO2 occurs after and not before the earth has warmed? This would again suggest that CO2 is a result of global warming, not a cause.
\
In the years between 1940 and 1970, when there was a dramatic surge in CO2 emissions, didn't global temperature actually fall precipitously? If so, how could that happen? Also, is it true that in the mid-'70s, many climate scientists stirred concern in predicting an impending ice age and global cooling based upon their measurements?
\
Is it true that the famous ""hockey stick"" graph of earth temperatures, which suggests severe and sudden warming, is only one of many graphs which have been produced, all of which are based on imperfect data? Is it true that many other models show that Earth is warming slightly, but not anywhere near the alarming degree shown in the hockey stick graph made famous by ""An Inconvenient Truth""?
\
Were temperatures both significantly colder and significantly hotter than they are now (or are predicted to be by many models of the future) long before the invention of the internal combustion engine, or human activity, suggesting that natural cycles which we may not understand may be at work? For example, is it true that humans used to farm in an iceless Greenland long ago?
\
Is CO2 actually a nontoxic gas that is important to nature's life cycle, and is it only a minority part of the so-called ""greenhouse gases""? Is it true that human activity really accounts for only a relatively small percentage of the CO2 which is released into the atmosphere every day?
\
Are there really plausible alternative explanations, including one that shows that the amount of cloud cover as influenced by sun activity, gamma and cosmic rays is a better explanation of global warming than CO2 levels?
\
Finally, is it true that if we instituted even dramatic curbs on human CO2 emission, the amount of change in atmospheric CO2 or in Earth's temperature would be negligible and virtually imperceptible?
\
To better understand the controversy, it may be worthwhile to watch ""An Inconvenient Truth"" as well as the BBC's ""The Great Global Warming Swindle,"" which is free and can be found online. It also may help to check out the Web sites www.friendsofscience.org and newsbusters.org/node/9498. Taken together, these sources may help us to define what needs to be an open debate about global warming. Let's approach these challenges armed with an understanding of facts rather than fear and hysteria.

157,"The report released Sunday by United Nations climate scientists on what it would take to avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change offers little in the way of good news. The old goal of holding the average global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius isn't sufficient - and we weren't on track to achieving it anyway, because the United States, the worlds second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, isn't committed to it thanks to President Donald Trump's determination to exit the Paris climate accords. Instead, we need to hold the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius if we are to have any hope of avoiding mass droughts, famines, refugee crises, destruction of coastal communities and even more frequent extreme weather events. And that doesn't even speak to the toll on the natural environment, which would see mass extinctions. Put another way, the economic cost of the 1.5-degree rise would be $54 trillion globally, compared to $69 trillion if the average increase hits 2 degrees.\Here's the bright side, such as it is: We could achieve the lower level of warming with existing technologies. It would merely take a coordinated human response that is unprecedented in scale. Given the political realities, not just here but also in the developing world where climate concerns tend to be framed against the effort to lift massive populations out of poverty, that may sound unimaginable. But if we want to preserve anything like life as we know it, we need to start imagining. Here are a few things a real effort at limiting rising temperatures would mean.\• First and foremost, we would need to radically remake the energy sector. Depending on the mix of solutions we pursue, we would need to cut fossil fuel use for electricity generation in half or more by 2050 (some scenarios say we need to eliminate it almost entirely), and in all circumstances, coal fired power plants would need to all but disappear. Use of renewable energy would need to quadruple and become the dominant form of generation. On the plus side, trends are already headed in that direction, and advances in biomass and storage for energy from solar and wind are encouraging, but we would need to achieve the transformation on a much larger scale than we are now.\• Energy efficiency will be key. Under a status quo scenario, global energy use would rise 75 percent by 2050. We would need to hold that to about 10 percent to achieve the 1.5-degree target, and some groups have modeled scenarios in which the population increases, the economy grows and we still use less total energy in 2050 than we do today. Efficiency is particularly important in industry, which is the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and in transportation. Better land use, planning and logistics will be needed to cut down on transportation emissions, as well as greater use of buses and trains than cars, trucks and airplanes.\• Meanwhile, we would need to use de-carbonized electricity for more and more of our energy needs, including heating and transportation. The UN report anticipates an increase in the use of low-carbon fuels in the transportation sector from about 10 percent now to 40 percent by 2050. Air travel is a real problem point here - unless the aerospace industry can come up with massive increases in energy efficiency or some as-yet unknown form of non-carbon propulsion, flying would have to become much rarer and train travel much more common.\• Agriculture would change massively. Most scenarios to reduce carbon emissions to the extent necessary rely heavily on bio-energy and carbon capture technology (more on that last part shortly). The bio-energy part of the equation means growing plants for use in generating electricity, whether by burning or some form of chemical energy generation. The plus side is that the plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while it grows. The down side is that it would displace vast amounts of land that would otherwise be used to grow crops for food needed by an ever-growing population. Likewise, reforestation is an important component of the plans for its ability to pull carbon from the atmosphere and store it long-term, and that, too, squeezes agriculture. A clear consequence of all this is that meat would have to become a much smaller part of the global diet - it is carbon-inefficient to produce, creates potent greenhouse gases of its own (such as methane) and takes up a lot of land.\• Technologies that exist now but which are not deployed on any kind of commercial scale would need to expand massively. Carbon capture is a big one - whatever emissions we produce from generating electricity would need to be captured and stored, likely in geological formations underground or depleted oil and gas fields. It's technically possible but has not been done in any kind of cost-effective way. The UN panel makes carbon capture, biofuels and other exotic (but existing) technologies a significant part of its plan as a way to apply the brakes to emissions (and even get to net-negative emissions) in the later decades of its forecast, but not everyone is buying that idea. Others have come up with ways to hold climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius without them (or at least without much of them), but it requires much bigger advances on all other fronts.\• The economic incentives for de-carbonization would need to change. The most obvious way to achieve that is through carbon pricing, whether through a direct tax, or a cap and trade scheme, but the UN panel says the price would need to be far higher than anyone has attempted - $135-$5,500 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution by 2030. To put that in context, Australia had perhaps the most ambitious carbon tax, $23 per ton, enacted in 2013. It worked but was massively unpopular and was repealed a short time later.\All of this sounds daunting, but it's way harder than that. The problem isn't that achieving all that would be necessary would necessarily lead us to a poorer future than the present in which we live - the efficiencies and new industries this effort would require are generally expected to be a net positive for the global economy, and the U.N. found real synergies between its goals for sustainable development in poorer countries and the strategies necessary to combat climate change. But it would require an understanding that grappling with climate will have to be the singular occupation of humanity for decades to come. It may be a lost cause to hope that the current occupant of the White House, he who made no comment on the U.N. report but has pledged to revive the coal industry, will even begin to recognize the importance of the challenge before us, and that means, at best, two more wasted years.\But we can show our willingness to recognize the urgency of climate change. California has done it with its own carbon pricing plan. Voters in Washington State will get the chance to enact their own. Here in Maryland, we can elect people this fall who will put Maryland on a path toward 100 percent clean energy. There may be no substitute for action by the United States government, but we are not helpless. We know what needs to be done, and we all must start demanding it.\Caption: KAL/Baltimore Sun"
158,"As energy prices soar and global warming awareness grows, more Americans are buying hybrid cars, outfitting their homes with low-energy light bulbs and worrying about the distance their food travels from farm to plate. But when it comes to air travel, how many pay attention to the jet fuel their flights consume and the carbon emissions those planes generate?\Though aviation represents only 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, that share is likely to rise as air traffic grows - the Federal Aviation Administration says commercial flights in the U.S. alone will increase 60 percent by 2030. Passenger jets are about a third more fuel-efficient today than those built 40 years ago, and their design continues to improve. But worldwide traffic growth is projected to outstrip efficiency improvements, leading to an increase of carbon dioxide emissions from aviation of 3 percent to 4 percent per year, according to the 2007 report of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\Adding to concerns is the nature of aircraft emissions. Because nitrous oxide pollutants are discharged at such high altitudes, damage to the ozone layer is amplified and the cloud-like contrails formed have an additional heat-trapping effect.\Together, those factors may bring new regulatory and economic pressures on airlines.\""Going forward, climate change could be the most significant challenge facing aviation,"" said Daniel K. Elwell, the FAA's assistant administrator for aviation policy, planning and the environment. ""We could run up against environmental limits to aviation growth before we run into actual concrete infrastructure limits at airports.""\Already, the European Union is pushing for international airlines to pay for the carbon gases they produce. The move has tensions simmering across the Atlantic. Europe's nascent cap-and-trade system would be expanded to limit the amount of carbon dioxide airlines could release, saddling them with extra costs if they exceed those caps and allowing them to sell off credits if fuel consumption is reduced.\But the method for regulating aviation emissions is complicated, because the pollutants are largely produced outside neat national borders.\Major U.S. airlines, represented by the Air Transport Association, have balked at any regulation proposal. With oil pushing the $130-a-barrel mark, the carriers argue that jet fuel prices - their largest expense - act as a carbon tax, providing all the incentive they need to conserve.\The federal government also maintains that Europe's unilateral plan could violate international aviation treaties.\Regardless, the next U.S. president will face mounting pressure to adopt cap-and-trade legislation that includes aviation. Recently, the Senate killed the proposed Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act, which would have forced refineries to pay for the carbon dioxide emitted in fuel production, a cost they would likely have passed on to airlines and other petroleum-dependent industries.\""The notion that any substantial sector can be excused is unlikely,"" said Jonathan Pershing, a U.S. and international climate change policy expert at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental think tank. ""Aviation emissions are growing faster than any other transportation sector and ultimately will account for as much 5 percent of global emissions unless those are accounted for or curtailed. It's bigger than steel.""\Rising fuel prices have forced airlines to enact conservation measures that have the side benefit of curbing emissions. In March, Southwest Airlines started flying at slower speeds, a remedy Northwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways also employ. Slowing down adds just minutes to flying times but could save Southwest 18 million gallons of jet fuel this year, said a company spokeswoman, Whitney Eichinger.\Southwest also uses its now-iconic curved winglets to reduce drag on its newer Boeing 737-700s and some of its older 737-300s. Other airlines, including AirTran Airways, have installed the winglets, creating fuel savings of 3 to 4 percent on an average 737-700 flight, the Air Transport Association said.\Anything airlines can do to limit the idling of aircraft engines on the taxiway helps. American Airlines has its aircraft taxi on one engine whenever possible and, similar to Southwest and AirTran, uses ground power instead of the plane's unit to provide electricity and air conditioning at many gates.\Financially strapped airlines such as American, Delta and United plan to retire some aging, gas-draining planes. But the economic slowdown also means carriers have delayed or canceled the delivery of new, more fuel-efficient planes.\Commercial service on Boeing's new 787 jetliners won't debut until the third quarter of 2009, a delivery date pushed back three times. The 787 is the first jumbo jet to be built primarily of lighter carbon-fiber composites, requiring 20 percent less fuel than a comparable aluminum-bodied plane, Boeing says. So far, few of the orders for the 787 jetliners are from U.S. carriers.Until Congress upgrades the nation's 1950s-era air traffic control system to fully support satellite navigation, airlines have less motivation to purchase newly outfitted planes, said Elwell of the FAA.\Planes will be able to fly closer together on more direct routes under the system, reducing fuel burn. Improvements have already come as the required vertical distance between planes flying in the stratosphere was halved to 1,000 feet in 2005, he said. The FAA also opened up new routes recently over the Atlantic Ocean to allow planes to fly more efficient trips from New York to the Caribbean.\The satellite technology would also reduce emissions and noise generated during arrivals, by allowing aircraft to remain at higher altitudes longer and use less power as they descend toward a destination, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report. Overall, full implementation of the new ""NextGen"" air traffic control system could reduce aviation emissions up to 12 percent by 2025, according to the FAA.\Alternative fuels to jet kerosene aren't yet a viable solution. But the race is on. Plane maker Airbus and manufacturer Honeywell International Inc. recently said they are developing an algae-based biofuel that could power nearly a third of commercial aircraft worldwide by 2030.\Virgin Atlantic earned bragging rights in February with the world's first biofuel-powered commercial flight, a passenger-less jumbo jet partially fueled on an edible cocktail of coconut and babassu nut oil. In 2009, Continental Airlines and Boeing are scheduled to make the first U.S. commercial test, using a more advanced blend of biofuels.\In the meantime, what's a green-minded traveler to do? Take more efficient rail or bus transportation for short-haul trips. Pay for nonstop flights, as extra take-offs and landings guzzle fuel. But don't pay for business class. The more people packed into coach, the more efficient the flight.\On a trip from Baltimore to New York City, flying would generate twice as many carbon emissions as driving in a compact car, according to NativeEnergy.com, which handles carbon offsets. But a longer flight to Boston would generate .079 tons of CO2, compared to .101 tons CO2 from the drive.\You can pay a carbon-offsetting group to reduce emissions equal to the amount a trip generates. The money helps fund wind farms or solar panel installations, for example. Some airlines even allow customers to purchase offsets as they book tickets online.\Silver Spring-based Carbonfund.org has a new partnership with JetBlue to sell offsets directly to its passengers.\""Airlines understand that theirs is an industry where it's a lot more difficult to reduce carbon,"" said Eric Carlson, Carbonfund.org's founder and a former Environmental Protection Agency employee. ""They realize that their consumers want green options, and that there are things they can do to reduce their emissions, and then they want to offer the opportunity to offset the rest.""\But since the offset industry is unregulated, it's difficult for consumers to determine which organizations live up to their claims.\Nor is any voluntary program likely to account for all the pollutants generated by such a huge industry.\""Offsets are not the overall solution,"" said Pershing. ""Ultimately we have to figure out how to reduce emissions in aviation - not let aviation pay for somebody else to reduce emissions.""\Laura.mccandlish@baltsun.com\Credit: Sun reporter"

B.A., Amherst College, 1973; J.D., Northeastern University, 1978. Member, House of Delegates, 1987 to 2007. Comptroller of Maryland, 2007 to present.\* Improvements: We can build upon cost-saving measures to become more efficient. We need to develop an economic vision that emphasizes Maryland's strengths. We also need a bipartisan top-to-bottom review of state spending inclusive of the private sector and we must not raise or enact new taxes during the recession.\William Henry Campbell\* Party: Republican\* Background: B.S., Massachusetts Maritime Academy; M.S., The Johns Hopkins University; Diploma in Resource Management, National Defense University; Assistant Secretary for Management and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Coast Guard. Chief Financial Officer, Amtrak.\* Improvements: We have done an inadequate job of enforcing our tax laws and regulations for many years. I am sceptical that the $240 million (M) MITS project to enhance revenue collection and enforcement is being adequately managed. I have successfully implemented similars large, complex software solutions.\U.S. Senate\Questions:\* Budget: What methods would you support to address the federal budget deficit?\* Fossil fuels: What should be done at the federal level to reduce our use of and dependence on fossil fuels?\* Immigration: What changes, if any, do you support in regard to immigration policy?\* Corportations/elections: What do you think is the proper role of corporations in elections?\* Education: What role should the federal government play in public education?\* Security: What are the most important steps towards assuring the short- and long-term security of our country?\Barbara A. Mikulski\* Party: Democrat\* Background: B.A., Mount Saint Agnes College, 1958; M.S.W., University of Maryland, 1965. Member, Baltimore City Council, 1971 to 1976. Member, House of Representatives, 1977 to 1987. Member, U.S. Senate, 1987 to present.\* Budget: Tough choices must be made. The bipartisan debt commission is developing proposals to balance the budget. In the mean time, I have supported efforts to reduce waste, fraud and abuse in the federal budget. I have supported the Pay as You Go Law, which requires new spending to be offset by spending.\* Fossil fuels: It is essential that we decrease our reliance on fossil fuels. I support a sensible energy plan that promotes alternative energy efficiency and reduces global warming. Energy independence is important for our national security and future job creation.I absolutely oppose drilling off coast.\* Immigration: I believe that comprehensive immigration reform must protect our borders, protect American jobs and not penalize those who have played by the rules. It is important that we adopt a sensible approach to dealing with the illegal immigrants who are currently in the country.\* Corportations/elections: The law does not allow direct contributions in Federal elections. I support the law.\* Education: It is primarily a state and local issue, I fight each year to increase funding for special education to ensure success in school and life. I have fought to make higher education more affordable by increasing student aid,creating a tuition tax credit and creating a national funding service program.\* Security: My goal is to be safer, stronger and smarter. My foreign policy principles are treat your allies with respect, deal with our enemies with resolve and fight terrorism relentlessly. I support a strong military. That means providing the resources, technology and necessary training.\Eric Wargotz\* Party: Republican\* Background: B.S., Rutgers University, 1978; M.D., The Ohio State University, 1983. Medical Director/Chief of Pathology, Doctors Community Hospital, 1989 to 2007. Clinical Professor, Pathology, George Washington University Medical Center, 1986 to 1987. President, Queen Anne's County Board of County Commissioners, 2006 to 2008; Member, Queen Anne's County Board of County Commissioners, 2008 to present.\* Budget: Government waste,abuse,incompetence,and fraud are threatening our future. I will work to institute fiscal discipline,vote against deficit spending and bailouts and against porkbarrel earmarks. I support a balanced budget amendment and increased accountability. We must lower taxes and create jobs.\* Fossil fuels: We need to continue to develop more energy sources and find innovative ways to use less energy. We should continue to invest in wind,solar,clean coal,biofuels,nuclear energy,as well as oil and natural gas. This will reduce dependence on Middle Eastern oil and create thousands of jobs here at home.\* Immigration: Safeguarding the homeland is the federal government's greatest responsibility and complacency is the Nation's greatest threat. I will fight to ensure our Nation remains safe,free and prosperous. We must secure our borders. We must enforce existing immigration laws: no rewarding illegal behavior.\* Corportations/elections: The role of corporations in the election process will continue to be debated. I do concur with the most recent decision by the Supreme Court.\* Education: Every State Constitution mandates that public education be provided. Perhaps the only role the Federal government should play in education is one of ensuring that the States provide what they are required to provide.\* Security: A strong national economy with lower taxes,job creation,a strong dollar,less energy dependence on foreign oil and renewed confidence in our federal government will enhance our national security. I support security policies based on principles of not appeasing terrorists and no civil trials for them.\Kenniss Henry\* Party: Green\* Background: Lifelong resident of Maryland. Agreed to replace her daughter, Natasha Pettigrew, as the Green Party nominee for U.S. Senate after Pettigrew was killed while cycling in Prince George's County.\* Budget: I strongly support decreasing the Pentagon?s budget, ending earmark spending, and retooling the Federal income tax structure to benefit the People instead of corporate America. Additionally, we must end corporate welfare and aggressively eliminate Federal waste among the agencies.\* Fossil fuels: There needs to be encouragement and support for states to build wind farms, make solar panels less cost-prohibitive, and aggressively implement research into hydropower. Development of effective bike lanes also needs to be done on a large scale. Many people would drive less with safe bike lanes.\* Immigration: Many immigration laws are either not enforced or not enforced equally among all immigrants. We, as a country, need to decide if we are going to enforce immigration laws equally. If not, the laws need to go and we go back to the days of ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses...""\* Corportations/elections: Corporations have no role. By allowing corporations an even larger role the United States Supreme Court has ensured that the People do not matter. Corporations can continue to buy candidates who best represent their interests, as opposed to the interests of our communities and the United States.\* Education: The Federal Government should not usurp the power of the states to educate their citizens. However, the Federal Government should be allowed to support states? curricula development appropriate for producing future Americans.\* Security: The United States must perform its due diligence, conduct internal independent audits, and assure that Congress is responsible for any declarations of war. We also need to maintain stringent border patrol and ensure staffing to conduct adequate port inspections.\Richard Shawver\* Party: Constitution\* Background: Duty Fire Chief, Maryland National Guard, 1976 to 1998. Employee, Hecht Company, 1966 to 2004. U.S. Marine Corps Reserves, 1973 to 1975. Marine Corps, 1964 to 1966.\* Budget: Article 1, Secton 8; Congress must obey their oath.\* Fossil fuels: Hydroelectric plants, clean burning coal plants.\* Immigration: Article 1 Section 8; Illegal who were felons could not become citizens.\* Corportations/elections: There no proper role.\* Education: None; its the states' role.\* Security: Article 1 Section 8\U.S. House of Representatives\Questions:\* Budget: What methods would you support to address the federal budget deficit?\* Fossil fuels: What should be done at the federal level to reduce our use of and dependence on fossil fuels?\* Immigration: What changes, if any, do you support in regard to immigration policy?\* Corportations/elections: What do you think is the proper role of corporations in elections?\* Education: What role should the federal government play in public education?\* Security: What are the most important steps towards assuring the short- and long-term security of our country?\1st Congressional District\Frank M. Kratovil Jr.\* Party: Democrat\* Background: B.A., Western Maryland College, 1990. J.D., University of Baltimore, 1994. State's Attorney, Queen Anne's County, 2003 to 2009. Assistant State's Attorney, Prince George's County, 1995 to 1997. Assistant State's Attorney, Queen Anne's County, 1997 to 2001. Member, U.S. House of Representatives, 2009 to present.\* Budget: As a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, cutting spending and getting control of the deficit have been my top priorities. My first act in Congress was to work to block a Congressional pay increase. I wrote a bill to mandate 2% reductions in spending and voted against $6 trillion in spending, while backing a Pay-Go law and a balanced budget amendment.\* Fossil fuels: I support investing in new domestic energy sources like solar and wind technology to end our dependence on foreign oil. We must also protect the Chesapeake Bay, which is one of Maryland's treasures and is critical to our economy. It supports thousands of jobs and preserves our way of life. That is why I've secured $33 million to clean up the Bay.\* Immigration: Our first immigration priority must be enforcing the laws currently on the books and taking steps to ensure that illegal behavior is not rewarded. I've fought to secure our borders and written legislation to crack down on employers who hire illegal workers. I oppose amnesty for those here illegally.\* Corportations/elections: In light of the Citizens' United court ruling, we must update our laws to include common sense safeguards that allow individuals to express their rights without giving corporations, particularly foreign-owned corporations, to unduly in"" uence our elections. In doing so, we must ensure we are not infringing on Americans' First Amendment rights.\* Education: As the father of 5 children, I believe investing in education is the key to our continued prosperity. To improve our schools, we must work together to recruit and retain high quality educators in Maryland. I will continue to advocate for adequate and equitable funding for education as a shared responsibility among local, state and federal government.\* Security: As a member of the Armed Services Committee, our nation's security is one of my top priorities. That's why I've introduced a bill to more severely punish white-collar crimes that finance terrorist activities. I've also fought to honor our veterans' service by ensuring them access to the benefitts they've earned including mental health services.\Andy Harris\* Party: Republican\* Background: B.S., 1977, M.D., 1980, M.H.S., 1995, The Johns Hopkins University. Anesthesiologist. Member, Maryland Senate, 1999 to present. Commander, U.S. Naval Reserve.\* Budget: One of the biggest problems in Washington is the out of control spending. We have to stop spending trillions of dollars on so-called stimulus bills that aren't creating jobs and stop wasting taxpayers' hard-earned money. We need to focus on balancing our budget, not continuing Nancy Pelosi's spending spree.\* Fossil fuels: The United States has enormous energy potential, which is why we need to develop energy independence and low cost energy. We don't need a ""cap and trade"" energy tax that will cost families $1,600 per year.\* Immigration: I recognize the need for legal, temporary workers who don't displace American workers, but we must enforce their return home when their visas expire. Illegal immigration is illegal. Everyone in this country must obey the laws and face consequences if they don't.\* Corportations/elections: We have to take a good hard look at outside groups and their influence on the campaign process in the Unites States. If there's going to be serious campaign finance reform, then spending by unions must also be addressed.\* Education: I believe that funding and decisions regarding education should be kept primarily at the state and local level. The Federal Department of Education has over-expanded its scope and taken resources that could be better utilized if they stayed at the local level.\* Security: The first responsibility of the federal government is to protect and defend the American people. As a Navy veteran, I know that we live in a dangerous world and we must maintain our defenses against our enemies. We must protect our allies and keep their trust by keeping our promises. Peace is kept through strength. I strongly support funding for defense and homeland security programs to ensure that the U.S. has the best-equipped and best-trained military in the world.\Richard James Davis\* Party: Libertarian\* Background: B.S., Allegheny College, 1974. D.D.S., The Ohio State University, 1980. Dentist in private practice, 1982 to present.\* Budget: Require Balanced Budget; Drastic Reductions in Federal Spending including elimination of Federal Departments including Education, Energy, Labor, and Major Parts of Health & Human Services and Housing & Urban Development.\* Fossil fuels: Remove all subsidies from all forms of energy production and allow supply and demand to establish price levels which will ultimately force more efficient use and conservation.\* Immigration: We need a comprehensive, functional guest-worker program so workers who are truly needed can get work visas. Then we need a thorough national discussion to reach some consensus as to how many people our economy and our environment can support. Then we can decide how many, if any, permanent immigrants to accept.\* Corportations/elections: For-Profit Corporations should have no role in elections. Corporate subsidies, tax preferences, and any other preferential or discriminatory treatment by government should be eliminated. Separation of Business and State should be comparable to Separation of Church and State.\* Education: None. Education should be locally controlled as there is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in education. The Federal Department of Education should be abolished.\* Security: 1. Minimize interference in other countries' internal affairs. 2. A reduced, well-trained and equipped career military with greatly enhanced and broadened reserves limited to actual DEFENSE functions. 3. Improved intelligence functions and cooperation. 4. Greatly reduced Presidential power to deploy troops without Congressional Declaration of War.\2nd Congressional District\C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger\* Party: Democrat\* Background: University of Maryland; J.D., University of Baltimore, 1970. Assistant State's Attorney, Baltimore County, 1972 to 1980. Member, Baltimore County Council, 1986 to 1994. Baltimore County Executive, 1994 to 2002. Member, U.S. House of Representatives, 2003 to present.\* Budget: I submitted a balanced budget for eight consecutive years as Baltimore County Executive. I support ""pay-go"" which requires tax cuts or new spending to be funded by cuts to other programs. We must cut waste and ensure government work that can be done in-house is not outsourced.\* Fossil fuels: Domestic renewable energy sources will reduce our dependence on dirty fossil fuels and hostile nations. Funding for research and development as well as tax credits for energy-efficient appliances for homeowners and businesses will help save money and reduce our carbon footprint.\* Immigration: I do not support illegal immigration. In Congress, I introduced legislation to hire 10,000 new border patrol agents. I support the government veri! cation system known as e-Verify, cracking down on companies who knowingly hire illegal workers and deporting felons who are here illegally.\* Corportations/elections: America needsan election system encouraging participation from diverse candidates. I support limited public financing where candidates raise small contributions from their home states, eliminating the role of corporations. Politicians should focus less on raising money and more time helping people.\* Education: The federal government's role is to fund public education and set uniform standards. States and local school districts must have the resources they need to modernize schools, hire and train outstanding teachers and reduce class sizes.\* Security: As a Member of the Intelligence Committee and a representative of the National Security Agency, I believe good intelligence is the best way to prevent terrorism. We must give intel workers the resources they need to keep our country safe from terrorists, cyber hackers, or others trying to harm us.\Marcelo Cardarelli\* Party: Republican\* Background: M.D., Universidad de Buenos Aires, 1980; M.S., The Johns Hopkins University, 2006. Surgeon, University of Maryland Hospital for Children, 1993 to present.\* Budget: A Balanced Budget Amendment. Spending should be sustainable and within the scope of our Constitutional obligations. Revising down our Federal Budget line-by-line to reduce waste, fraud and abuse particularly in the two largest areas of expenditures, healthcare and defense.\* Fossil fuels: In the medium-long term, we need to stimulate the private sector to create the new businesses that will develop the energy technologies of the future. I am personally against subsidies and would rather propose tax incentives for those willing to take the risk of investing in this area.\* Immigration: Secure the borders. Discourage the hiring illegal workers. Befriend pro-market democracies south of the border. Illegal immigration is an economic problem, not a political one.\* Corportations/elections: Corporations are currently banned from giving directly to political campaigns and I support that.\* Education: Having an educated population is probably the best predictor of social stability, economic growth and entrepreneurial development. I believe that it is up to each individual State to partake in the education of its population. I do not see a major role for the federal government in this area.\* Security: America's top security issues are: The war on terrorism, the security of our borders and the existence of terrorism friendly countries with nuclear capabilities (N. Korea, Iran and Pakistan). We must stop using conventional means to fight unconventional wars and we need to prevent the next 9/11.\Lorenzo Gaztanaga\* Party: Libertarian\* Background: Attended University of Baltimore, Towson State University, Loyola College. Security officer, Master Security, 2007 tro present.\* Budget: End wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; close military outposts around the world. End the ""War on Drugs."" Abandon fascistic Homeland Security concept. Stop corporate bail-outs. Reduce salaries and benefits of federal elected officials. These measures will save trillions of dollars.\* Fossil fuels: Eliminate corporate welfare to fossil fuel companies. Fight local regulations restricting solar panels and other renewable energy sources on aesthetic grounds. I do not propose writing laws directing local governments, but I will jawbone for this and look for the leaders who can lead in this regard.\* Immigration: Building a wall on the border is an expensive waste. Stop extracting ""legal"" bribes to expedite applicants' paperwork, and streamline the immigration process. If you can demonstrate that you are gainfully employed and not a criminal threat to the community, you should be legal, period.\* Corportations/elections: Corporations should have no role in elections. All contributions should be from living, breathing individuals only. Would it be perfect? No. Would it be better? Yes. No corporations -- neither GE nor the AFL-CIO, period.\* Education: None. Since the Department of Education was established, the level of instruction has declined. Abolishing the DOE and keeping the money at the local level would save billions. The DOE is a jobs program for people who like to blather and posture and make six figure salaries doing so. Get rid of it.\* Security: Our civil liberties are being eroded in the name of fighting terrorism. Repeal the Patriot Act; stop nation building and trying to restart the cold war. Promote a foreign policy based on free exchange. Becoming an empire killed Rome, and it will kill us, too. For security's sake, stop the wars.\3rd Congressional District\John Sarbanes\* Party: Democrat\* Background: A.B., Princeton University, 1984. J.D., Harvard University, 1988. Attorney. Special Assistant to State Superintendent of Schools, 1998 to 2005. Member, U.S. House of Representatives, 2007 to present.\* Budget: As the economy begins to recover, we must take a serious look at all elements of spending and tax revenue in order to return to fiscal responsibility. Our budget policies should reflect our nation's values- ensuring opportunity, promoting innovation, and sharing the costs of government equitably.\* Fossil fuels: By reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, we can address economic, security, and environmental priorities at once. Just as growth in IT was behind the economic boom of the 1990's, clean energy technology and green jobs will spur growth and offer long-term strength to the American economy.\* Immigration: I support immigration reform that includes improved border security and law enforcement; a focus on punishing employers who knowingly hire illegal workers; and a practical approach to undocumented workers currently in the country. It must improve our security and maintain our national values.\* Corportations/elections: Campaign finance law should strengthen representational government and limit the influence of special interest groups on the electoral and legislative process. It must balance the fundamental right to free speech against the potential for well-funded special interests to exert improper influence.\* Education: I have been active and keenly interested in education policy throughout my professional life, working for the Maryland State Department of Education, and now in the Congress. I strongly support federal education policies that will ensure access to quality education for all Americans.\* Security: I am committed to fighting terrorism and defending our national interests. I support engagement and preventing destructive conflicts. Our defense spending should match what is required to meet clear national security objectives.\Jim Wilhelm\* Party: Republican\* Campaign Website: wilhelmforcongress.com\* Background: U.S. Naval Academy. Managing Partner/Chief Executive Officer, Transitioneering, 2005 to present.\* No response received by League of Women Voters deadline.\Jerry McKinley\* Party: Libertarian\* Background: Manager, Enterprise Product Development and Management, Verizon Wireless, 2004 to 2007, 2010 to present.\* Budget: Federal spending must be curtailed -- much like our own household budgets -- to eliminate deficit spending. I propose to identify efficiencies, eliminate redundancies and cut federal spending wherever possible. Any balanced budget must also include a plan to pay down and eliminate the national debt.\* Fossil fuels: The federal government should encourage reduction of consumption and provide market incentives for renewable and sustainable energy. National legislation could also be passed to streamline the permitting and approval processes for wind turbine & solar panel installations.\* Immigration: As the child of a legal immigrant, Jerry believes that immigrants bring new ideas, consumers and contributors in the marketplace as well as new opportunities. We should welcome legal immigrants and provide a system to encourage people to come here, assimilate and contribute to our society.\* Corportations/elections: Corporations should have the same level of access, ability to contribute financially and influence on elections as any other private citizen provided that their interests are aligned with those of the country and my fellow citizens and they are not provided any benefits by virtue of that role.\* Education: The federal government's role should be limited to encouraging alignment with international standards for education (such as the International Baccalaureate programs). Local authorities should retain the responsibility and accountability to ensure that students are provided a competitive education.\* Security: We must institute austere financial budgets and pay down the debts that we have issued. We need to become self-sufficient as a nation by encouraging companies to deliver products and services citizens desire and show how buying American provides jobs and other long-term benefits to the country.\Alain Lareau\* Party: Constitution\* Background: Electrician.\* No response received by League of Women Voters deadline.\5th Congressional District\Steny H. Hoyer\* Party: Democrat\* Background: B.S., University of Maryland, 1963. J.D., Georgetown University, 1966. President, Maryland Senate, 1975 to 1979; Member, Maryland Senate, 1967 to 1979. Member, U.S. House of Representatives member since 1981.\* Budget: Decreasing the deficit is a top priority and why I supported efforts that address it head on, including reinstating the pay-as-you-go law that helped create surpluses in the 1990s, establishing a bipartisan deficit reduction commission, and increasing scrutiny of how taxpayer money is spent.\* Fossil fuels: Energy independence is vital for our environment, economy and national security. I've been a longtime supporter of bills to help our country improve efficiency, decrease dependence on foreign oil, modernize our electrical grid, develop lower-emitting renewable energy and fuels, and promote development of new nuclear energy at Calvert Cliffs.\* Immigration: Reform should be practical and comprehensive starting with strong border control and enforcement. It must ensure that businesses have enough workers, but hold accountable those that hire illegal workers, and require those here illegally pay a fine, learn English, and get to the back of the line to earn citizenship.\* Corportations/elections: When huge sums of money from unknown sources dominate elections, the interests of ordinary citizens are often the victim. That is why I support the DISCLOSE Act, which takes needed action to ensure transparency and accountability, so Americans know which corporations are funding campaigns and can make better informed decisions.\* Education: I have supported public education because it is critical to creating a stronger workforce and prosperous economy, which is why I recently fought to prevent 140,000 teacher layoffs. Going forward, we must acknowledge our serious fiscal constraints and focus on accountability measures so that investments result in higher academic success.\* Security: We've made significant strides fighting against terrorists, getting real results that make Americans safer. In order to strengthen our security, we must continue working to restore America's global leadership, end torture, work more with allies, and get countries like Pakistan to more fully cooperate in the fight against terrorists.\Charles Lollar\* Party: Republican\* Background: A.A., Emory University, B.S., Kennesaw University, B.S., M.B.A, Regent University. General Manager, Cintas. Major, U.S. Marine Corps.\* Budget: We must reduce spending to affordable levels and not raise taxes. The role of federal government must be restored to do what only government can do like national security, public safety, border protection, and infrastructure. If we cannot first sustain the nation, individuals will not be able to sustain themselves.\* Fossil fuels: First, I would not punish the consumer and the economy with heavy-handed fuel taxes and carbon regulation. I encourage more efficient uses of such fuels such as use of diesel engines and public transportation. I would provide tax incentives for diverse alternatives such as telecommuting, and renewable sources of energy.\* Immigration: We can no longer turn a blind eye to illegal border crossings. We must secure our borders first and understand that amnesty would just encourage such crossings to continue. We must have open trade so economies can grow and people will eventually want to return to their home lands.\* Corportations/elections: The mixing of money and freedom of speech is a continuing challenge. As long as labor unions, political action committees, and other such entities can contribute funds to political causes; corporations must be treated no differently. Key is transparency of funds and their sources.\* Education: The federal role in local education must decline. The role of parents and communities must always be first. Sending scarce tax dollars from our pockets through Washington, never makes them wiser dollars. Federal policy should expand, but not dictate, opportunities for innovation such as vouchers, private and charter schools.\* Security: For vital security, we have no luxury of picking favorites. Our front line is wise diplomacy and a strong economy. We must sustain our deployed forces and provide modernization against future challenges. All rely on assured, effective, and accountable intelligence, in advance of threats, that is second to none.\H. Gavin Shickle\* Party: Libertarian\* Background: Former business owner. U.S military, Iraq.\* Budget: This is one of the key issues of my candidacy. I cannot stress how important it is that our federal government cuts spending in all areas. Right now the interest alone that we owe on our debt is approximately $500 BILLION dollars. We simply cannot continue to operate this way ...\* Fossil fuels: This country should be building more nuclear power plants to supply our daily energy needs. Nuclear energy is clean and reliable and efficient. Also, we should end subsidies for ethanol and stop using ethanol completely. Ethanol is less efficient as a fuel source than gasoline and uses oil at every\* Immigration: I see no need to change any immigration policies at this time.\* Corportations/elections: No response received.\* Education: The federal government should not be involved in education. This is a state and local issue. The federal government cannot possibly know the educational needs of every community. Current federal policy is an unintelligible grab bag of regulations and policies which have accomplished nothing other than to cause states to ...\* Security: First and foremost we need to pay down our debt. We have no security when our government can be held hostage monetarily by corporations and other nations. Secondly, we need to divest from China. We are giving vast sums of money to a government that is not our friend. China's ...\...\6th Congressional District\Andrew Duck\* Party: Democrat\* Background: B.A.A.S., Southwest Texas State University, 1994. Advisor to the Pentagon on Army Intelligence Issues, Office of the Deputy Army Chief of Staff, Northrop Grumman. Captain, U.S. Army, 1982 to 2004. Financial consultant, Merrill Lynch, 1990 to 1991.\* Budget: We must reduce spending and increase revenues. Based on my experience in the Pentagon, I would focus on reforming the Defense Acquisition Process, which is extremely inefficient. I support rolling back the tax cuts for persons earning over $200,000. We can balance our budget; we did it 10 years ago.\* Fossil fuels: We need a portfolio of alternative energy options. I support research to improve options for wind, solar, geothermal, and bio-fuels; and increased conservation. I support geo-thermal heating and cooling for federal buildings. The Sixth District should be a leader in bio-fuels research, as we have the technology and the farmland.\* Immigration: Rather than change the law, we should enforce the existing law. Policies which are not enforced are useless. We should enforce the law which "" nes employers for hiring undocumented workers. Unless we shut off the magnet which is attracting illegal immigrants, we will not be successful dealing with this problem.\* Corportations/elections: None. Special interests already play too large a role in elections. Considering the ""Citizens United"" case, I would restrict corporations from interfering with electoral politics, by changing the law authorizing corporations. Persons have constitutional rights to free speech, but corporations only exist due to legislation, which can be changed.\* Education: Education is vital to maintaining our competitiveness in a global economy. No Child Left Behind has failed. Standardized tests are not a good measure of education. Cutting funding to failing schools will not improve them. I support Individual Education Plans that measure improvement by students, not by school.\* Security: We are engaged primarily in a ""Battle of Ideas"". As a combat veteran, I can tell you that military force should only be used as a last resort. If violence is used against us, we must respond with the appropriate level of force to ensure that any threat is defeated.\Roscoe G. Bartlett\* Party: Republican\* Background: B.A., Columbia Union College, 1947; M.S., 1949, Ph.D., 1952, University of Maryland. Scientist, farmer, teacher, inventor. Member, U.S. House of Representatives, 1993 to present.\* Budget: Long term entitlement reform must be addressed that is why I am a cosponsor (one of 12) of the only bill before Congress that addresses comprehensive entitlement reform, Road Map for America's Future, HR 4529. It provides health and retirement security, lifts the debt burden and promotes job creation.\* Fossil fuels: I advocate policies to support a transition from dependence upon finite fossil fuels, particularly imported oil, to domestic renewable resources. To accomplish this, we need to provide incentives for conservation and energy efficiency and we need to be careful that biofuels do not reduce food supplies.\* Immigration: We all should be proud that America is the most welcoming nation in the world but we need to enforce our existing laws and adequately protect our boarders. I am opposed to amnesty. Also, I am a member of the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus which seeks solutions to illegal immigration.\* Corportations/elections: Corporations should not be treated differently than any other organization, such as a union. I believe that the critical issue is freedom of speech; the Congress should not decide the conditions under which it may be exercised. Corporations like other groups and individuals have campaign contribution limits.\* Education: I believe that the role of the federal government is limited to ensuring that no citizen is barred from the public school systems. However, the decision relating to and the administration of public education should be done on the community level by parents, teachers, local and state government.\* Security: We must reduce our national debt to strengthen our economy and national defense. As already stated, I support the only serious comprehensive entitlement reform bill. As a senior member of the House Armed Services committee, I have proposed and passed programs to maintain our nation's military superiority.\Dan Massey\* Party: Libertarian\* Background: B.S., U.S. Naval Academy, 1994; M.S., U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, 2000. Executive officer, U.S. Navy. Employed by a family business.\* Budget: Flat tax, entitlement reform - privatize Social Security and Medicare, end corporate welfare, make budgets less detailed, less micromanaged. I am a believer in Austrian Economics (see Ludwig von Mises Institute) property rights and less government interference (i.e. smaller budget) in our lives.\* Fossil fuels: The government should stay out of fossil fuels. As fossil fuel becomes hard to get the price will go up and money will flow to other energy forms research and development. Remove all drilling bans as well as all tax credits and supports from the government.\* Immigration: The simple solution to immigration is to remove visa quotas. Allow all that want to come here legally do so. There would be no reason to come here illegally when you can easily get a visa. Hispanics sneak in because there is a 10 year wait for a visa.\* Corportations/elections: I feel that any person or corporation should be allowed to spend what ever they want on any election or candidate but the amount they spend must also be fully disclosed.\* Education: The federal government should stay out of public education. That is the role of the local community. School Principles and School Boards should have more responsibility with money which means more accountability. Charter schools and vouchers are two means of accountability.\* Security: The current military is one of the finest in history. To maintain that cutting edge military we must avoid nation building and less micromanagement of the budget by Congress.\Michael Reed\* Party: Constitution\* Background: B.S., University of Richmond, 1994. J.D., University of Tulsa, 1997. Owner, The Reed Law Firm LLC and Associate Settlements LLC.\* Budget: The printing of money must stop. Bailouts and takeovers of private industries must stop. I would support any efforts to balance the budget, as each responsible citizen of this nation is already doing.\* Fossil fuels: We should first limit our dependence on foreign fossil fuels, by using our abundant fuels here in the United States, including domestic natural gas and coal, in addition to oil.\* Immigration: I support enforcement of immigration laws that are already in place. There is a specific naturalization process that must be followed. I believe Arizona has enacted SB 1070 because, in their view, the federal government had failed to enforce existing immigration laws.\* Corportations/elections: Qualified individuals have the right to vote, not corporations. Corporate interests can conflict with that of individual voters. Also, a corporate entity or union should never coerce an individual from voting.\* Education: The Constitution does not enumerate a role of the federal government to regulate education. It is best left to state and local governments to manage the school systems, as ""one size does not fit all.""\* Security: In the long and short term, we need to make sure that our borders are secure; that our military is well-funded; that they are not stretched across the globe in undeclared wars; and that our military bases here in the U.S. are well-staffed in state of the art facilities.\7th Congressional District\Elijah E. Cummings\* Party: Democrat\* Background: Howard University, 1973; University of Maryland, J.D., 1976. Member, Maryland House of Delegates, 14 years, Speaker Pro Tem. Member, U.S. House of Representatives, 1996 to present.?\* Budget: We should reinstate the more progressive tax structure of the 1990s and remain true to the ""pay-go"" budget discipline re-established by the current Democratic leadership.\* Fossil fuels: Implement the goals of: (1) creating 5 million green jobs (2) conserving 20% of our energy by 2015; (3) freezing pollution levels now, cutting them at least 25% below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80% by 2050; (4) limiting new coal plants; and (5) investing in renewable energy.\* Immigration: I support comprehensive immigration reform to better secure our borders, protect workers against abuse, limit the downward pressure on wages and unify families. We must act both realistically and humanely toward the millions of undocumented workers and their families who currently are within the U.S.\* Corportations/elections: I voted for the successful House passage of the Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections Act [DISCLOSE] Act [H.R. 5175] which seeks to limit corporate spending on elections by requiring disclosure of political advertising funding.\* Education: The federal government should fully fund its education mandates (like ESEA and IDEA), providing the resources that will allow our teachers to properly educate every child. We must adequately educate every child.\* Security: I strongly support the Obama Administration's efforts to stop nuclear proliferation.\Frank Mirabile Jr.\* Party: Republican\* Background: B.S., West Virginia University. Small business owner for 20 years.\* Budget: We must cut government spending, transition out of mandated entitlements and pass policy that will fuel private sector growth, generate personal wealth and promote social independence. The present push for more entitlements creates social dependency beholden to government control. Such policy is detrimental to personal empowerment and burdens economic growth.\* Fossil fuels: The ultimate goal is sustainable energy solutions. I'm against cap and trade and any resultant carbon tax. We must put Americans to work extracting our own natural resources thereby growing our economy to financial solvency and encouraging the private sector to develop clean energy technology without government hindrance or subsidies.\* Immigration: If you enter our country without following our rules of immigration then you are subject to the full extent of our laws. That being said immigration is one of the most valued assets of our nation. Our policies should protect the sanctity of citizenship and promote a nation welcoming many.\* Corportations/elections: If limitations or regulations are put on corporations the same should be applicable to unions, law firms, foundations, etc. (equal application). Full disclosures for all are reasonable. Public sector unions should be banned from any election influences either directly or indirectly. They are indirectly spending private sector tax payer money.\* Education: Control over education should be the responsibility of state and local boards. Local boards should have the ultimate power of policy and decision. Push for more school vouchers and school choice. This will force public schools to enhance their net results bidding for your business. Introduce greater use of technologies.\* Security: National security is the number one job of the federal government.\Scott Spencer\* Party: Libertarian\* No response received by League of Women Voter deadline.\8th Congressional District\Chris Van Hollen\* Party: Democrat\* Background: B.A., Swarthmore College, 1982; M.P.P., Harvard University, 1985; J.D., Georgetown University, 1990.

Member, Maryland House of Delegates, 1991 to 1995.\* Budget: Support PAYGO, which forces the federal government to live within its means. Support the House FY11 Budget Enforcement Resolution, which cuts discretionary spending below President Obama's request. Support the Administration's review of the federal budget to identify and eliminate wasteful spending.\* Fossil fuels: Current dependence on fossil fuels harms our environment & national security. We need comprehensive clean energy policy that improves efficiency standards; creates a renewable electricity standard; places a price on carbon; and establishes a federally charted ""Green Bank"" to accelerate clean energy\* Immigration: We must strengthen border security, interior enforcement and prevent illegal immigration. Support comprehensive immigration reform patterned after earlier McCain-Kennedy bill. Fix our legal immigration system to end huge backlogs.\* Corportations/elections: Introduced DISCLOSE ACT to address SCOTUS ruling in Citizens United case which permitted any organization or corporation to spend unlimited money on political advertisements. This legislation will provide unprecedented transparency in America's elections; ensuring corporations cannot mislead voters\* Education: Federal government should encourage school systems to meet high academic standards & provide necessary resources. Pass the first bill I introduced, Keep our Promises to America's Children & Teachers Act which requires the federal government to fully fund NCLB & the federal special education law-IDEA\* Security: Maintain our military strength by making necessary changes proposed by Sec. Gates. Recognize the link between a strong economy and our national security. Increase our international competitiveness and reduce our long-term debt. Lead not only by might of our military, but by power of our ideas.\Michael Lee Philips\* Party: Republican\* Background: B.S., Texas A&M University. Small business owner.\* Budget: Reduce funding for the Arts, non humanitarian Foreign Aid, United Nations, Welfare, Agriculture, discretionary spending freeze, new weapon sys R&D, Fed. spending on education, homeland security, medical & scientific R&D, Dept of Commerce, Transportation, HHS, end bailouts, stimulus, repeal Obamacare\* Fossil fuels: Purchase a minimum of 10% of its energy directly from wind, solar and geothermal energy producers & increase that level by 1% per year until 70% is reached. Another 10% should come from nuclear sources. Conservation programs within the government. Incentives for businesses / homeowners to conserve.\* Immigration: No blanket amnesty. Reduce # of legal immigrants to 250K / year. No driver's licenses or social services for illegal aliens. Support states to reduce illegal immigration. No road to citizenship, but legal status for some. Increase attrition thru enforcement. Enforce the law. Support E-Verify.\* Corportations/elections: No more of a voice than Unions. If Unions have a voice, then corporations should have a voice. If Unions have unlimited rights to spend money to support or defeat candidates, then corporations should have the same rights. If you take the voice away from both, I would favor excluding both.\* Education: None. The feds have failed our kids. This is a state's right. Every state has the means to educate its citizens. The federal government should reduce taxes or proportionately return taxes to each state and allow the states to use those funds to educate its own children in the way they see fit.\* Security: Cyber Security, cargo at ports, security at our border, enforce immigration laws, prepare to stop nuclear attacks from Iran. Reduce the deficit to avoid a financial collapse like the USSR experienced which ended the cold war and left Russia destitute and vulnerable to the theft of nuclear materials.\Mark Grannis\* Party: Libertarian\* Background: Georgetown University; J.D., University of Michigan. Attorney, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP.\* Budget: Our federal government spends too much on things it shouldn't be doing in the first place. We cannot control federal spending by trimming here and there. We must cut government back to constitutional proportions, by privatizing some functions and letting states perform others closer to home.\* Fossil fuels: Government spending to reduce reliance on fossil fuels is completely unnecessary. Plenty of people will pursue so-called green technology without any federal handouts, and when they find viable answers they'll bring them to market and make bundles. We should end these expensive corporate giveaways.\* Immigration: Anyone who wants to work or invest here should be welcome here. If we fix the tax code and eliminate ways to game the welfare-state system, there will be no reason to turn away immigrants with useful skills and clean records. Sound fiscal policy and sound immigration policy agree on this point.\* Corportations/elections: There's no such thing as too much political speech, and all kinds of groups use the corporate form. Regulation of campaign speech by incumbents inevitably favors incumbents over those who want change. Chris Van Hollen's awful DISCLOSE Act illustrates this, and in a nakedly partisan way.\* Education: The nationalization of public education has been a well-intentioned flop, and the flop was of dubious constitutionality to begin with. We should abolish federal education programs and restore state and local authority over public education.\* Security: The best security is to make no enemies and many friends. Free trade, diplomacy, and a strong domestic defense make us safer; military interventions in the affairs of other nations don't. Congress must reassert its authority over war and peace, and sunset existing authorizations of force.\Fred Nordhorn\* Party: Constitution\* Background: Veteran.\* Budget: 1.Support an amended to the constitution that prevents amendments to a bill if it not related to the bill. 2.Make all pork items be put in one bill and let the president have line item veto on that bill only. 3.Stop making government agency buying items they do not want -- like the F22 fighter\* Fossil fuels: We must stop the Drilling Digging, Digging and Drilling with an occasional Mountain Top removing that has been going on for years. manitory recycling, Places like Waste Treatment plants & Oil Refineries should be using the gases they burn off to make electric power. Support the Purple line.\* Immigration: 1. Enforce the law that we have already. 2. Stop stalling on building the Border Fence. 3. Full funding for E-verify & US-VISIT programs. My Grandfather (Father Side) came to this county legally thru Ellis Island. My mother side, some where on the first boats other meet the first boats.\* Corportations/elections: None! Only US Citizen 18 or over should be able to donate to elections. If need amended the constitution with some like this: Only US Citizen 18 or over or who will be 18 at the time of the general election may make donations to elections.\* Education: The No Child Left behind Act, had good intensions, the problem is our teachers now teach a test. We need to relook the Act. We also must stop cutting the Arts, Music and Shop, and enforce the reinstalling of these classes.\* Security: Short-term: Secure our border.\Statewide ballot questions\MD Question 1: Maryland Constitutional Convention\* Should a constitutional convention be called for the purpose of changing the Maryland Constitution?\* Senate Bill 26, Chapter 9 of the 2010 Session - Under Article XIV, Section 2 of the Maryland Constitution the General Assembly is required to ask the voters every 20 years whether a constitutional convention should be called for the purpose of altering the Maryland Constitution.\* Voters will be asked to vote FOR or AGAINST holding a constitutional convention.\* Background: The Maryland Constitution states that it is the duty of the General Assembly to ""provide by law for taking, at the general election to be held in 1970 and every twenty years thereafter, the sense of the people in regard to calling a convention for altering this Constitution. If a majority of voters at such election or elections vote for the convention, the General Assembly must provide by law at its next session for the assembling of, and elections of delegates to, the convention.""\* What happens if this passes? According to our current constitution, if on November 2nd a majority of voters vote for a constitutional convention, at the General Assembly's next session it must pass legislation defining the general structure/organization of the constitutional convention and how the delegates would be elected. It would then be the role of the delegates to draft a new Maryland Constitution to be placed before the voters for adoption or rejection.\* Pros: The present constitution is considerably longer than the average state constitution and nearly twice as long as the United States Constitution and gets more unwieldy as each amendment is proposed and adopted. Some believe that some of the amendments adopted over the years do more than just prescribe the basic framework for the system of government and should be removed. Major improvements to the structure of state government are more likely to be achieved though a constitutional convention than by amendments proposed by legislators who are elected through the political process.\* Cons: There is no particular need for a state constitution to mirror the federal constitution in form or length. A constitutional convention is a long and expensive process and should not be undertaken unless the voters feel the need for a fundamental change in state government. There is no guarantee that the delegates would not be elected by special interest groups and the likelihood that voters will accept, in totality, a new constitution could render the whole process a waste of resources. Amendments proposed by legislators and approved by voters are a more practical way to achieve reform.\MD Question 2: Constitutional Amendment - Trial by Jury\* Authorizing the enactment of legislation to limit the right to a jury trial in a civil proceeding to those proceedings in which the amount in controversy exceeds $15,000. Amending Maryland Declaration of Rights -- Articles 5(a) and 23 - Under Articles 5 and 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, a party in a civil proceeding has a right to a jury trial where the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000. In cases where the amount in controversy does not exceed this threshold amount, a judge, rather than a jury, determines the verdict. The constitutional amendment would increase the amount-in-controversy limitation by providing that a party may not demand a jury trial in a civil proceeding unless the amount in controversy exceeds $15,000, excluding attorney's fees if attorney's fees are recoverable in the proceeding.\* Voters will be asked to vote FOR or AGAINST the Constitutional Amendment.\* Background: Currently civil cases may be heard by the District Court where only a judge presides as long as the amount in dispute does not exceed $30,000. If the plaintiff files the case in the District Court and the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, a defendant may demand a jury trial and the case must be transferred to the Circuit Court. The threshold for the right to demand a jury trial was changed to $5,000 in 1992, and then to $10,000 in 1998. During the 2010 session of the General Assembly, both chambers of the legislature passed Senate Bill 119 by a three-fifths majority. This bill proposed to amend the constitution to say that a defendant in a civil proceeding would not have the right to demand a jury trial unless the amount in controversy is more than $15,000 (excluding attorney?s fees if those fees may be reimbursed as a result of the decision.).\* What happens if this passes? -- If a majority of voters vote for the constitutional amendment, the threshold for demanding a jury trial would increase to $15,000.\* Pros: If this passes, the state could save the time and expense involved in providing a jury trial for civil proceedings where the amount in dispute is between $10,000 and $15,000.\* Cons: Defendants in cases where the amount in controversy is between $10,000 and $15,000, excluding attorney fees, would lose the right to demand a jury hear the case.\MD Question 3: Constitutional Amendment - Baltimore City Judge of the Orphans' Court\* Requires judges of the Orphans' Court in Baltimore City to be members in good standing of the Maryland Bar who are admitted to practice law in Maryland. Under the Maryland Constitution, the voters of each county and Baltimore City elect three judges to the Orphans'Court of their respective jurisdictions, with the exception of Montgomery and Harford counties, where circuit court judges sit as the Orphans? Court. The judges must be citizens of the State and residents, for the preceding 12 months, in the city or county in which they are elected. The constitutional amendment would add an additional eligibility requirement for judges of the Orphans' Court in Baltimore City, requiring them to be members in good standing of the Maryland Bar who are admitted to practice law in Maryland.\* Voters will be asked to vote FOR or AGAINST this constitutional amendment.\* Background: Orphans' Court judges hear all contested matters regarding a decedent's estate, including validity of wills and legal questions involving transfers of property. The Orphans' Court also supervises estates that are probated judicially; approves accounts, awards of personal representatives' commissions, and attorneys fees in all estates; and has concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts in the guardianship of minors and their property. Although many Orpan's Court judges are attorneys, they are not required to be lawyers or members of the state bar.\* What happens if this passes? If a majority of voters statewide, as well as a majority of voters in Baltimore City, vote for this Constitutional amendment, the additional requirement of being in good standing in the Maryland Bar and admitted to practice law in Maryland will be applied to all Orphans' Court Judges in Baltimore City.\Baltimore County Executive\Kevin Kamenetz\* Age: 52\* Occupation: General practice lawyer, four-term member of Baltimore County Council\* Residence: Owings Mills\* Education: The Johns Hopkins University, University of Maryland School of Law\* Experience: Former Baltimore City assistant state's attorney\On issues:\* Fiscal management: Argues that current fiscal management has served the county well. Points out that this year's budget is 4.4 percent below last year's, and that he has been part of the admininstration that voted to cut the tax rate twice in the last eight years without cutting services or forcing county employee layoffs or furloughs.\* Public safety: Supports innovative approaches to law enforcement, including more use of broadband communications in patrol cars. Introduced the law that requires security cameras in parking lots of large county shopping center, a move that has been credited with helping to reduce crime.\* Economic development: Recently advocated development of an office and restaurant part in Randallstown, and argues that he has supported economic development efforts that have helped more than 30 companies expand, relocate or open in the county this year alone.\Kenneth C. Holt\* Age: 59\* Occupation: Senior vice president, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney; runs small family beef cattle business\* Residence: Kingsville\* Eduation: University of Maryland, College Park\* Experience: Former one-term member, Maryland House of Delegates; formerly ran international competitive horse auction business\On issues:\* Fiscal management: Argues that the county can save between 3 and 8 percent in costs through a range of efficiencies in department operations, money that would help cushion the blow of potential new expenses likely to be imposed in teacher pension costs now covered by the state.\* Public safety: Argues for law enforcement enhanced with broadband wireless technology and more effort on cyber security. Would use technology to track violent offenders and see federal money for Homeland Security and DNA data.\* Economic development: Proposes platform including expansion of the county's economic development efforts with a larger department, more ""enterprise zones"" to direct aid to distressed areas and specific business sites, such as the Solo Cup plant in Owings Mills. Supports using existing rail lines to establish transit links between Baltimore Crossroads on the east side and Randallstown on the west."
160,"In a little more than a year, a regional push to cap greenhouse gases has raised millions for Maryland energy programs, with supporters calling it a model for easing climate change on a national or even global scale.\Since September 2008, Maryland and nine other Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states have been participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. In its ""cap and trade"" regulatory scheme, emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants have been capped and plant operators are required to buy permits for all the gas that their facilities release into the atmosphere.\Similar programs, in which businesses buy and sell the rights to release greenhouse gases, are being considered for extension nationwide under legislation in Congress that passed the House last summer and is pending in the Senate. It's also on the table for international action at rancorous United Nations climate talks scheduled to conclude Friday in Copenhagen.\""While Washington and the world debate this in Copenhagen, we've already exercised leadership and proved that cap-and-trade can work, said Malcolm Woolf, director of the Maryland Energy Administration, ""and we are investing the proceeds in helping families and businesses.""\Some business groups and conservative critics have warned that cap-and-trade regulation of greenhouse gases could cripple the U.S. economy, driving energy prices through the roof and putting millions out of work. Some economists and environmentalists also oppose the approach, arguing that it's too complicated and fraught with loopholes to make a real dent in emissions that threaten to drastically alter the world's climate.\But power companies in Maryland and the nine other states have been paying for the rights to emit greenhouse gases for more than a year with slight impact on consumers' electric bills. Baltimore Gas and Electric Co.'s residential customers are paying perhaps $1.25 a month more as the costs of the carbon-dioxide permits are passed through, said Constellation Energy spokesman John Quinn. That represents about 1 percent of the average household's electric bill.\Meanwhile, the state has collected more than $96 million in revenue from the six carbon-dioxide auctions held since September 2008, with the funds earmarked for providing relief from energy costs and ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\Specifically, half the funds this year go to help poor families pay their power bills, while nearly a quarter goes to provide a bit of rate relief for all residential utility customers - about 43 cents on the typical household power bill this winter, according to Quinn.\Another 18 percent goes into promoting energy efficiency and conservation, with an additional 6 percent earmarked to provide grants and low-interest loans for homes and businesses to install ""clean"" energy systems.\Frank and Lois Bohdal are among more than 600 Marylanders this year who have received state grants funded in part with carbon-auction proceeds to help them put in home solar, wind or geothermal energy systems.\Bohdal, a computer programmer with the state comptroller's office, has blanketed the south-facing roof of the couple's Millersville rancher with 40 solar panels. They cost a total of $55,000 - but the state helped cover their installation with nearly $14,000 in grants. And the electricity they generate has reduced the couple's power bill by nearly a third.\""So far, it's been worthwhile to me,"" said Bohdal, who notes that he was able to cover about half the upfront costs with federal and local tax credits.\Some of the carbon-auction funds also are going into retrofitting low-income apartment complexes with better insulation and energy-efficient appliances and lighting. The state recently awarded grants to fix up the 158-unit Sierra Woods apartments in Columbia and another complex in Montgomery County. Using the auction proceeds and federal stimulus funds, the state hopes to work on nearly 1,600 apartments this year.\""We do believe that in the long haul it will help make these properties and the rents more sustainable for our residents,"" said Pat Silvester of the state Department of Housing and Community Development, which is overseeing the projects.\The regional effort in the East has inspired similar collaborations of states in the Midwest and the West, and supporters believe it helped build support on Capitol Hill for the cap-and-trade plan to curb greenhouse gases that is written into the bill that passed the House in June. A similar approach is being considered in the Senate.\But some note that the greenhouse gas initiative wasn't much of a test of the idea of using the market to achieve pollution reductions, since states purposely set their caps on carbon dioxide above what power plants were emitting at the time. The price of pollution allowances sold by the states have ranged between $2 and $3.50 per ton, while the Environmental Protection Agency estimates carbon credits would sell initially for $12 to $15 per ton under the more sweeping cap-and-trade approach in the House bill. A congressional budget analysis found that the cost per household in higher energy bills would average $175 a year.\Maryland officials say the states intentionally set a loose-fitting ceiling on carbon-dioxide emission for the first few years so power plants could get used to paying for pollution allowances.\The plan is to gradually reduce the allowable emissions 10 percent by 2018, ultimately making the allowances more valuable, and costly.\Bids for the carbon credits through six auctions have been within the range projected by the states, but they've trended downward lately. In the most recent auction Dec. 2, carbon dioxide allowances went for $2.05 each, down from a high of $3.51 per ton in March. And for the first time two weeks ago, the states were unable to sell all the allowances they had put up for bid on future emissions.\Karen Palmer, an economist with the Washington think tank Resources for the Future, said bidding appears to have cooled on the regional carbon auctions partly because of uncertainty about how it would be affected by federal legislation. The bill that passed the House would effectively replace the regional power-plant curbs with a nationwide cap on all greenhouse gases, though the pollution credits sold under the regional auctions could still be used to help meet the new, more rigorous federal control scheme.\Another reason for declining bids, Palmer said, is the slumping national economy, which has reduced the demand for carbon-dioxide permits now. Power plant emissions have declined as the business downturn lowered demand for energy, she pointed out.\With recent auction proceeds less than projected, that's forced the states to pare back what they can expect to get and spend on energy programs. In Maryland, though, Woolf says the drop in carbon-auction proceeds has been made up for by an infusion of federal economic stimulus funds earmarked for energy efficiency and clean energy efforts.\""The ultimate goal was always to demonstrate for the country that a cap-and-trade system could work,"" said Shari T. Wilson, Maryland secretary of the environment. ""Really, that goal has been accomplished.""\Some argue that imposing a tax on carbon would be a better way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They acknowledge, though, that cap-and-trade garnered support, at least initially, from businesses and from many environmentalists.\Charles Komanoff, co-director of the Carbon Tax Center, said some green groups evidently believed the market plan would be a ""stealth"" way to tax carbon, and he contended that businesses were looking to write special deals for themselves into the complicated House bill, which runs to more than 1,000 pages. Senate action has been delayed by debate over health insurance reform, though members also remain split over the bill's economic impact and some even question scientific evidence of climate change.\The regional experience with cap-and-trade has won over Constellation Energy, it seems. ""We were supportive of an experiment,"" said company spokesman Quinn, ""that a market-based system that put money back into solving the problem wasn't a bad idea.""\Now, he added, ""It's time to do a comprehensive program, rather than piecemeal it."" The company's chairman and CEO, Mayo A. Shattuck III, issued a statement at the beginning of the U.N. climate summit supporting an international accord committing the United States and all other countries to reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases.\Credit: tim.wheeler@baltsun.com"
161,"SEE HARD COPY FOR CHART\ Global warming. The words themselves conjure up beads of sweat. Is Mother Nature getting a fever? Can she survive it? Can we afford the cure?\ Leaders from 160 nations are flying to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, this week to take the planet's temperature at the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development, better known as the Earth Summit.\ Top on the agenda of the 12-day session is a treaty that would pledge world leaders to avert a global warm-up by curbing emissions of so-called ""greenhouse gases,"" chiefly carbon dioxide.\ Many scientists worry that the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases will turn up the thermostat on the Earth's natural greenhouse, raising global temperatures. The result could be nightmarish problems, such as coastal flooding, drought, famine and extinction of plants and animals.\ In Maryland, for instance, the projected sea-level rise could aggravate persistent shoreline erosion in the Chesapeake Bay, inundating historic waterfront communities like Smith Island and St. Michaels. Soft clams might vanish from the bay, and the recently restored striped bass, or rockfish, could be stressed trying to live in water even slightly warmer than it is now.\ In dry, hot regions of the world, where food production is already difficult, rising temperatures could worsen droughts, according to Cynthia Rosenzweig, an agronomist at Columbia University. As a result, up to 120 million more people might go hungry each year, said Dr. Rosenzweig, co-author of a study on the effect of climate change on world food supply.\ Skeptics counter that global warming, if it occurs, will be mild and mainly benign. They foresee lower heating bills and longer growing seasons for farmers in temperate regions like the United States.\ These arguments among scientists mirror the bickering among politicians that has begun even before the opening gavel in Brazil. Environmentalists have accused President Bush of courting global disaster by getting the proposed climate treaty stripped of targets and timetables.\ ""History gave him a mandate to lead at a critical juncture in the world's history, and he has absolutely refused to do so,"" Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., said last week of Mr. Bush.\ ""I think it's disgraceful,"" added Senator Gore, an outspoken environmental advocate who is leading a Senate delegation to Rio.\ Some business groups and conservatives, meanwhile, have complained that, despite its lack of teeth, the treaty remains a folly, an economic straitjacket being peddled by doomsayers, who were warning just 15 years ago that another Ice Age was coming.\ ""Why should the United States want to take the lead in pushing such hokum?"" asked Murray L. Weidenbaum, a former chief economist in the Reagan administration.\ Global warming first captured headlines and the public's attention in the searing summer of 1988 when Dr. James Hansen of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute of Space Studies in New York told a congressional committee that he was ""99 percent confident"" that ""the greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate now.""\ The theory behind Dr. Hansen's assertion is nearly a century old. It was posed in 1896 by a Swedish chemist, Svante Arrehnius, who predicted that carbon dioxide emitted by coal-burning factories of his era could eventually warm the planet.\ Put simply, the greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere act as an invisible blanket. They capture the sun's warming infrared rays after they are reflected off the planet's surface. Otherwise, much of the sun's energy would bounce off the Earth into space, leaving it as cold and apparently lifeless as Mars.\ Naturally occurring water vapor makes up the largest part of the greenhouse gases. But scientists say there is little that can be done to influence the amount of moisture in the planet's atmosphere.\ The chief threat of excess warming comes from carbon dioxide, mainly from burning fossil fuels, and a few other gases, most of which occur naturally but which also are byproducts of human activity.\ Carbon dioxide, which accounts for more than half the man-made greenhouse gases, has risen 25 percent since pre-industrial times. Another gas, methane, released by cattle, plant decay, rice paddies and coal mines, has doubled.\ The evidence of global warming so far has been less than conclusive.\ Temperature records dating back to the 1850s indicate that the planet has warmed about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the past century.\ Everyone has felt the heat in the past decade. The 1980s had six of the 10 hottest years ever measured.\ But skeptics like Dr. Richard Lindzen, a meteorologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argue that the rise in temperature so far can be chalked up to the natural vagaries of climate -- a string of hot summers and mild winters, but nothing to get alarmed about.\ ""The politics have not only outrun the science but redefined it,"" Dr. Lindzen said.\ Even warming theory believers acknowledge that, so far, the average temperature increase is not big enough to be blamed on human activity.\ Scientists have looked back in time for clues, poring over the logs of ancient Viking explorers for references to sea ice. Others have studied glaciers and tree rings.\ But the bulk of the case for global warming relies largely on computer projections. Using complex mathematical models that simulate the Earth's climate, scientists predict that if the current buildup of man-made greenhouse gases continues, the planet will warm by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century.\ That may not seem much, but the average temperature was no more than 3 degrees colder during the ""little Ice Age"" in the 14th century, when the Baltic Sea froze over twice. And for the past 10,000 years, Earth was at no point more than 4 degrees warmer than it is now, according to Irving Mintzer, a senior research scholar at the University of Maryland's Center for Global Change.\ A U.N.-sponsored panel of climate experts, looking at all the uncertainties, this year reaffirmed its earlier finding that global temperatures are likely to rise if current emission trends continue.\ Recently, the Bush administration has concurred that the signs point to warming.\ But given the limitations of computer models, scientists caution that they cannot predict with certainty how far or how fast the mercury will rise, or what that means to inhabitants of different parts of the world.\ One widely expected impact, however, is a rise in sea level as glaciers and northern ice melt. Scientists forecast that the waters will rise by from 1 foot to more than 3 feet over the next century.\ Half the world's population lives in coastal areas, and flood-prone countries like Bangladesh and Indonesia are most at risk. In this country, experts say that low-lying areas along the East and Gulf coasts are vulnerable to flooding, increased shore erosion and storm damage.\ Maryland's Atlantic coast and bay shoreline could be especially at risk. Tide gauge records show that the sea level has been rising 3 to 4 millimeters a year. But part of that apparent rise is because the land itself is sinking for unknown reasons, said Dr. J. Court Stevenson, a wetlands ecologist at the University of Maryland.\ Tidal marshes, vital sources of food and shelter for waterfowl and fish, are already rapidly disappearing under water, Dr. Stevenson said, and those losses will increase if the sea level rises as predicted.\ St. Michaels in Talbot County could suffer severe flooding in even a moderate storm if the sea level rises 3 feet by the end of the next century, Dr. Stevenson said, and all that would be left above water on Smith Island would be the fishing community's dump and graveyard.\ In the past century, the sea level has risen about 1 foot along the bay, working through shore erosion to wash away Sharp's Island near the mouth of the Choptank River and more than a dozen other islands, many of them once inhabited, said Dr. Stephen Leatherman, a geographer at the University of Maryland.\ Shore erosion already is severe at some points around the bay, where the land recedes 6 to 8 feet a year. Dr. Stevenson and Dr. Michael S. Kearney, a University of Maryland geographer, predict that waterfront property worth from $90 million to $120 million could wash away every year if erosion doubles, as expected.\ The potential impact on farming is more optimistic, at least in this part of the world. Since plants need carbon dioxide, doubling its concentration in the air can lead to a 30 percent to 50 percent improvement in crop yield.\ ""With crops, I think the evidence is overwhelming that they will respond positively,"" said Dr. Bert Drake, a staff scientist at the Smithsonian Institution's environmental research center in Edgewater.\ But that may not be so in warmer countries like Bangladesh, India and Indonesia, where rice is the staple. Rising temperatures can reduce rice fertility and even shorten the growing season, said Dr. Alan Teramura, a University of Maryland botanist.\ Natural ecosystems could be upset. Up to one-fifth of the 15,000 plant species growing in North America may be unable to survive if average temperatures rise 8 degrees, according to preliminary results from a utility industry-funded study by the Nature Conservancy.\ The more common plants and trees will survive and may be able to ""migrate,"" as they have during past climate changes. But as many as half the plants now considered endangered could be wiped out because their numbers and their range already are extremely limited, according to Dr. David Maddox, a research botanist for the conservancy.\ Given the uncertainties and the potential for calamity, some have argued that world leaders need to begin curbing greenhouse gas emissions now. But the Bush administration balked at setting any binding limits, fearing that they could hamper America's economic recovery.\ One study by CONSAD Research Corp. warned that the United States could lose 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade if the country went along with one warming remedy proposed by environmentalists -- a ""carbon tax"" on the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels.\ But environmentalists and some businessmen contend that curbing greenhouse gases need not bankrupt the country. In the absence of conclusive proof of global warming, they recommend taking steps that make sense for other reasons, such as reducing pollution or oil imports.\ They advocate promoting energy efficiency and conservation, development of ""renewable"" energy like solar and wind power, and reforestation, and they note that Europe and Japan are aggressively seeking to develop new products and industries in these fields.\ ""It's not good enough to wait until there's a catastrophe, and then decide to act,"" said Senator Gore. ""If we act now, we're going to be better off, since the range of possible outcomes include catastrophes that are almost biblical in scale.""\ TOMORROW: Sizing up the summit."
162," Not since Thomas Edison banished the darkness when he invented the original incandescent bulb 113 years ago has there been an announcement with such significant potential as the new ""E-Lamp.""\ Today, a standard incandescent bulb makes light by heating a tungsten filament white hot, then scattering its light through a special coating. But only 5 percent of that energy gets turned into useful light. That means the 100-watt bulbs popular in many homes -- 20 are about average per home -- are really 95-watt heaters.\ That extra heat can help the furnace -- some office buildings are even designed to use it -- but in general, this is wasted energy. Few ventilation systems are designed to move this heat around the room where it will benefit the occupants. In summer, burning light bulbs even work against the air conditioner, driving up utility bills.\ The E-lamp promises a major advance. It fits standard sockets and has the same shape and color as standard incandescents. More important, it is 75 percent more efficient at producing light, thus saving on power bills. Its radio-frequency excitement of phosphor coatings eliminates the filaments of conventional incandescents and fluorescents, allowing a vastly increased working life of up to 20,000 hours.\ In recent years, electric utilities have been working to popularize ""demand-side management,"" a fancy way to say conservation. Cheap energy disappeared with the first OPEC oil shock, making even utilities energy-conscious. The environment's rise on the public agenda also has meant that locating new power plants is now difficult, expensive and drawn out. Finally, the consumers scream over the costs, which get passed on to them.\ In Maryland and a few other states, demand-side management involves inducing large users such as state and local governments to replace incandescent lights with newer, compact fluorescents that use less power. Other techniques help, such as mandating time-of-day electricity pricing and persuading homeowners to allow remote-control air conditioner and water heater shut-offs during peak usage periods. Lighting, though, remains the No. 1 conservation target.\ Illumination consumes 25 percent of all electric power in the United States. But ""compact"" bulbs are not only more expensive than regular incandescents, they are bulkier and won't fit standard lamps. Wide use of E-lamps in the years ahead -- production starts next year on a limited basis -- could make a considerable dent in the nation's $30 billion annual lighting bill, not to mention reducing the need for new power plants."
163,"
Art Cerasani, an Arnold shop owner, had a square-peg-round-hole situation on his hands.
\
He needed an LED light - an energy-saving Light-Emitting Diode bulb - that could plug into standard fluorescent-bulb light boxes. His store, Ski Haus Sports Center and Cycleworks, like many other commercial spaces, has a ceiling festooned with fluorescent lighting fixtures.
\
So Cerasani did a little research to find a company in China that could manufacture a retrofitted bulb, and now he's reaping the environmental and financial rewards of his ingenuity.
\
Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. has committed to giving Cerasani an incentive check of $4,380 through its Smart Energy Savers Program as a reward for installing the low-wattage lighting.
\
Ski Haus is one of about 700 businesses that has received incentives through one of the utility's energy-saving consumer initiatives.
\
But BGE officials said businesses aren't the only ones that can save as they work to encourage more commercial and residential customers to take advantage of the benefits programs to chip away at their usage and monthly bills.
\
""I was just looking for ways to cut energy costs,"" Cerasani said. ""The difference is humongous.""
\
The program offers a variety of opportunities to help customers - both commercial and residential - conserve energy, save money on their bills and reduce their carbon footprint through services and incentives. According to the program policies, incentives for BGE business customers normally cover up to 50 percent of the total cost for retrofitting inefficient equipment and up to 75 percent of the incremental cost for new construction projects.
\
Program participants may select the contractor or service provider of their choosing to receive the rebates.
\
At Ski Haus on College Parkway, Cerasani replaced 136 4-foot-long fluorescent tubes and 20 2-foot-long fluorescent tubes.
\
With the new LED lights, Cerasani estimated he will save about 4,900 watts per hour of use. A normal fluorescent tube with a ballast, the bulb's starter, uses 45 watts per hour, Cerasani said, but his LED bulbs without a ballast use a third less energy at 15 watts per hour.
\
His total cost of supplies and installation came to about $8,760, so the rebate from BGE amounts to a 50 percent reimbursement of the project's total.
\
Ruth Kiselewich, the utility's director of Demand Side Management Programs, said though Cerasani came to BGE with a specific proposal, customers aren't required to have a plan to participate. Program officials can help match customers with projects that meet their needs, she said.
\
""That help comes in a number of fashions, from answering questions to meeting with a lot of people in person or our helping fund studies to find out the most cost-effective measures,"" she said.
\
Kiselewich said the program partners with ICF Resources, LLC, a company that offers consulting services in the energy markets.
\
""They have folks that specifically work as solution providers,"" she said.
\
Kiselewich said BGE's goal in offering incentives for energy-saving projects is manifold.
\
""We're very interested in helping our customers with tools to manage energy use,"" she said. ""We don't control the (market) price of energy, but we can help them with tools to manage their energy use.""
\
And beyond reducing customers' bills, the utility also must work in partnership with the Maryland Energy Administration and other agencies to cut down individuals' carbon emissions 15 percent by 2015, as promised under Gov. Martin O'Malley's EmPower Maryland initiative.
\
The Smart Energy Savers Program is not limited to businesses, Kiselewich added. Residential customers can participate through a number of initiatives.
\
One program provides rebates to families for replacing home appliances with high-efficiency refrigerators, freezers and washing machines. Another provides discounts on energy-saving light bulbs.
\
As for Cerasani, his mission isn't complete. He's now trying to convince other businesses to take advantage of the utility's energy-saving programs, and more specifically, the multiple benefits of LED lighting.
\
""We're all looking to save energy to protect the environment,"" he said. ""And one of the things that I've learned is that fluorescents are far from safe.""

"
164," We may not have an economic crisis yet. But you can tell there's a perceived political crisis when President Bush starts to imitate Jimmy Car- ter.\ On Monday Bush asked all Americans to be ""better conservers of energy"" by skipping nonessential driving. ""We can all pitch in,"" he said, according to transcription services.\ Bush also urged federal employees to carpool or use mass-transit and said the government would shift electricity use to off-peak hours, reducing demand when the grid is stressed.\ It was reminiscent of when former President Carter donned a sweater, sat by a fire and asked Americans to save energy by turning down thermostats during the natural gas shortages of the late 1970s.\ And it was a striking nod to ""demand-side"" management from an administration that once seemed to believe voracious energy use is an American birthright, and the heck with consequences.\ ""Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it cannot be the basis of a sound energy policy,"" Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2001, as noted by numerous news organizations.\ Asked the same year whether people should change lifestyles to alleviate an energy crisis, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ""That's a big no,"" adding, ""The president believes that it's an American way of life, and it should the goal of policymakers to protect the American way of life.""\ Now former oilman Bush is asking Americans to give up a little slice of their way of life for the greater good, at least temporarily.\ It's political crisis control as much as economic. With 2006 elections approaching, the administration has been blasted for appearing uncaring and aloof as millions suffer from storms and high gas prices.\ Spouting an ""all-for-one"" line lets Bush fly the flag of communitarian sacrifice without anybody worrying he'll actually enforce it. (Carter, on the other hand, gave the impression he would personally inspect your thermostat AND the wool content of your sweaters.)\ But the short-term vitality of the economy is threatened, too.\ Consumer confidence has plunged, retail sales are weak, and high energy prices could lead to lackluster holiday shopping, which would be even worse for Republicans next year than the perception that they're detached corporate lackeys.\ By my calculation oil prices have now increased enough since 2003 to take more than $100 billion out of Americans' pockets each year. At less than 2 percent of annual personal consumption of $8 trillion or so, that's not an enormous amount.\ But it's getting to the point where it could make a difference, and people on both sides of the political aisle in Washington are starting to talk about remedies.\ On Monday presidential spokesman Scott McClellan again urged Congress to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, a move that would do little to change petroleum prices or make the country energy-secure but could irreparably sully our natural heritage.\ People also are talking again about expanding coastal oil drilling, another risk that might cost more in environmental harm than it would deliver in energy benefits. Congressional Republicans are floating the idea of oil-refinery tax breaks for an industry that is making record profits, which doesn't make much more sense than Democratic proposals to expropriate oil-company assets through a ""windfall profits"" tax. (Another Carter-era idea.)\ Some of the administration's short-term supply remedies make sense. Tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and temporarily relaxing shipping and environmental emissions rules can ease the temporary crunch, if that's what it is.\ But long term, the biggest policy gains are to be had on the demand side - and not by encouraging cardigans and fewer drives to Wal-Mart. Stricter mileage standards would simultaneously reduce gas usage, improve the environment and promote safety by discouraging unnecessarily heavy vehicles.\ A bigger gas tax would further discourage petroleum use, encourage alternatives and finance federal research on fuel cells and solar power. Together they might forestall a real crisis in the future, with even more opportunities for mischief."
165,"
The energy report that began Gov. Martin O'Malley's tenure in Annapolis pulled no punches - and described a system as broken as his recent efforts to stop electricity rate hikes.
\
Soaring bills that arrive each month in Marylanders' mailboxes are not due to rising rates alone; the incomplete, inept, and incapable state energy system also is to blame.
\
In response, Mr. O'Malley's administration has begun the nascent steps of creating an energy policy aimed to prevent future situations like the 50 percent Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. rate increase that took effect on June 1.
\
""Maryland is not well prepared to face future energy challenges and impending energy crises,"" said the first sentence in the ""Major Findings"" section of the 2007 Energy Transition Report. ""Years of benign neglect by the state government have resulted in disarray and loss of leadership with regard to energy policy.""
\
What follows in the report are a litany of problems: electricity consumption rising about 15 times faster than generation between 1999 and 2005; out-of-state imports at 28 percent and rising; $500 million in costs caused by congested transmission; utility jobs and taxes being sent out of Maryland and as far away as Indiana.
\
""There is not significant awareness among the public, the legislature or the press and media about critical energy matters to build the consensus needed to form and adopt the best energy solutions for the state,"" the report says. ""Energy policy decisions that will vitally affect our state's economy, environment and households for many decades should not be taken in a climate too heavily influenced by single-issue politics, demagoguery and short- term solutions.""
\
A single-issue, however - the BGE increases - has provided a platform for the Governor's Office to preach the necessity of stepping out of Maryland's energy mess.
\
""We have to do a much better job of planning ahead and acting now,"" Mr. O'Malley said this month while introducing Malcolm Woolf as the new director of the Maryland Energy Administration. ""(A strategy) empowers consumers, instead of making us feel like victims.""
\
In a recent interview, Mr. Woolf talked about how the state cannot focus on just large solutions such as increasing coal plants or building new natural gas or nuclear power facilities.
\
While those options will stay on the table, he said, each resident also needs to take personal responsibility in reducing their consumption and easing the strain on Maryland's grid.
\
The state must increase supply and decrease demand, Mr. Woolf said.
\
""There are tremendous opportunities,"" he said. ""It doesn't take that much to dramatically reduce rates.""
\
'Little legal option'
\
Mr. O'Malley's first television ad of the gubernatorial campaign was a stark statement about the need for better energy decisions.
\
Against a background of an exasperated woman opening up expensive energy bills, a voice describes how former governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. and BGE failed Marylanders.
\
""The special interests already have their governor. We need one of our own,"" the ad says. ""Martin O'Malley - taking on BGE to stop the rate hikes.""
\
That result, however, did not happen.
\
In the Public Service Commission's May 23 decision on the BGE increases, there was ""reluctance, but little legal option"" to prevent the 50 percent hike.
\
The decision outlines a catalogue of flawed policies that backed the state into a corner: the transfer of BGE to a for-profit, private corporation; artificial rate caps that did not correlate to overall skyrocketing costs; creating a purchasing time schedule that was limiting and restrained, essentially allowing BGE to get most of its supply during the price explosion after hurricanes Katrina and Rita; and the failure of the PSC to act in any proactive, pro- consumer manner.
\
Although the energy plan itself is still in its infancy, the administration is confident it is creating an atmosphere that is less cozy with business interests.
\
Despite the BGE increases, the governor also has appointed people to the PSC who will be watchdogs for Maryland residents, said Rick Abbruzzese, a spokesman.
\
""Within weeks of taking office he has done that,"" Mr. Abbruzzese said. ""The governor is disappointed but in four months there is little you can do to change four years.""
\
Mr. O'Malley also signed a bill requiring the PSC to undertake studies into the availability of transmission and generation capacity and the options for re-regulating electricity. Up to $3 million can be spent for completing the work.
\
Ironically, the costs of the study will be paid by the utility companies - expenses the legislation acknowledges will at least partially be passed on to consumers.
\
New tactics
\
Maryland's bleak energy picture, however, goes beyond BGE and the PSC.
\
The state relies heavily on large suppliers with large facilities and congestion problems, and the regulations are onerous for renewable energy plants; more than 75 percent of Maryland's energy generating capacity is over 21 years old, and it will be at least 2015 before two proposed nuclear reactors at Calvert Cliffs could be completed, the transition report says.
\
Tax credits, loans and grants all need to be used to encourage new energy such as solar power, Mr. Woolf said, especially because the BP Solar plant in Frederick is one of the world's largest solar panel factories.
\
Bills passed during the General Assembly session exempt solar energy devices from state property tax, provide an income tax reduction for solar power grants, and increase the amount of solar and renewable energy the state has to use starting in 2008.
\
Alternative energy, however, is still years away from becoming a huge difference maker, Mr. Woolf said.
\
""The energy world is transforming,"" he said. ""(But) that is a longer-term transformation.""
\
More than half of Maryland's electricity comes from coal, but six facilities will have to undergo costly upgrades in order to comply with the state's air requirements, according to the transition report.
\
Doing so, however, could render them useless in terms of economics. Even newer coal technology that burns much cleaner is not in a competitive stage yet, Mr. Woolf said.
\
""I don't think anything is off the table,"" he said. ""(But) the low-hanging fruit is really on the demand side. That's the beauty of demand side management.""
\
For example, replacing a quarter of an average household's light bulbs with more energy efficient versions could save more than $100 a month, he said.
\
Switching off the outlets for appliances that are not in use, upgrading to ""Energy Star"" equipment, and turning down the water heater are all ways to make a home use less energy, Mr. Woolf said.
\
""There is no silver bullet,"" he said. ""(Better energy use) is going to take lots of individual actions.""

167,"
Greg was walking down the hallway of his new school when a group of kids he hoped to become friends with asked him to cut class with them.
\
""Come on, nobody's going to math today. They're having a quiz,"" his new acquaintances said. ""John's parents aren't home, so we're going to his house for lunch. Nobody will know."" Greg stood there, frozen. He was happy that the kids were inviting him, but he was unsure of what to do.
\
It would seem that Greg's choice is an easy one, but research has shown that even the obvious isn't clear when it comes to peer pressure.
\
The power of group psychology and the tremendous influence of peer pressure has been demonstrated by a social psychology experiment in which people are asked to match one line with another line of equal length. They have to pick between three rather obvious choices. Amazingly, if the individual is placed in a group with others who intentionally make the wrong choice, the odds are that he also will make the incorrect selection in order to conform.
\
In the study, more than 75 percent of the participants made the wrong choice in an apparent effort to go along with the group. Apparently, they would rather be wrong than be out of step with the majority. In some cases, personal judgment was corrupted by the group influence, as some individuals could no longer tell if their choice was right or wrong, even though the correct answer was obvious.
\
One explanation for this phenomenon is that many people inherently possess a strong emotional desire to be in agreement with the group. This may harken back to earlier stages of human development, when the principle of ""safety in numbers"" applied. There may have been a time when going against the majority risked exclusion from the group. This in turn may have had life and death consequences, as the group offered protection and access to resources which the individual alone may not have had.
\
In modern life, peer pressure is often thought of as the powerful influence of one's friends or social group. It can affect nearly every aspect of life, including beliefs, feelings and, most of all, behavior. While adults experience peer pressure to some extent, teenagers are considered particularly susceptible because they are less likely to have established their own firm sense of autonomy and identity.
\
In fact, it's natural for children to become increasingly involved with their peer group as they grow into adolescence. At the same time, the rapid physical, emotional and social changes they are experiencing may leave them personally uncertain. This increases their dependence on their peer group for guidance as they grow away from their family but are not yet confident of themselves. For some, the added problem of a weak family structure or poor support at home may further strengthen the influence of the peer group.
\
Many destructive adolescent behaviors have been attributed to peer pressure, including the early use of drugs or alcohol, sexual promiscuity, violence, theft and lack of interest in school. In these cases, group dynamics not only lessen the individual's personal judgment, but also diffuse responsibility and increase the willingness to take risks.
\
But peer pressure isn't always a bad thing. The same influences that can promote destructive behaviors may also encourage positive behaviors, emotional growth and healthy choices. For instance, trying out for a school play, joining a club, playing on a sports team and participating in religious activities are examples of positive peer-influenced activities.
\
The observation that peer pressure can work for or against positive behavior demonstrates that youth culture is not monolithic, but offers a variety of subcultures, some of which are constructive and others which are not. Parents would be wise not to resist movement toward peer influence, but to help direct their teens into peer cultures which hold healthy ideals and practices. Youth groups that model volunteerism, respect and compassion for others can be just as influential as a street gang.
\
Strategies for coping with negative peer influences involve strengthening teens so that they have the confidence to make good choices. By providing a stable home environment filled with warmth and love, there is less chance that children will search for that satisfaction elsewhere. By nurturing self-esteem, there is encouragement to form healthier peer attachments that demonstrate respect for others. By teaching and modeling social skills and assertiveness, you empower teenagers to negotiate with others and, if needed, to say ""no"" and remove themselves from dangerous situations.
\
Ultimately, teenagers need to know that they are not ""uncool,"" ""stupid"" or ""losers"" if they choose not to participate in destructive group behaviors. They need to know that it is important to make good choices for themselves, even if some of their peers are unhappy with them or disagree with them. If ""friends"" are not able to accept them as they are or respect their decisions, then of course they may not really be friends at all.
\
Of course, in order to demonstrate this degree of independence, teenagers needs a base set of good values and a strong sense of confidence in their own decision-making.
\
Some programs that teach youth how to resist negative peer pressure actually practice phrases or responses that teenagers can use. For example, on the more diplomatic side, the following phrases can be helpful:
\
-- ""No, I can't do that, but thanks for asking.""
\
-- ""No, thanks. I'm in training.""
\
-- ""No, I'm fine.""
\
-- ""No, I've got other stuff I need to do.""
\
If the pressure is high and a more forceful response is needed, the following phrases may be more effective:
\
-- ""No. Bug off.""
\
-- ""What are you, nuts? I'm not doing that.""
\
-- ""Thanks, but no thanks.""
\
-- ""I don't think so. Get lost.""
\
Regardless of which words are used, the essential ingredients are clarity and decisiveness.
\
As Greg stood in the hallway with the group of classmates waiting for his response to their invitation, his mind worked rapidly. He heard himself say, ""Hey guys, it sounds like fun, but that's not how I want to start out here. Maybe we could get together some other time.""
\
As he walked away, Greg heard the guys whispering to each other. Then, to his surprise, they followed him to class.

168," LAS VEGAS - Much like the landmarks of Paris, Venice and New York that dot this desert town, the beach at the glitzy Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino has been created for the benefit of tourists, with a wave pool, a lazy river and 1,700 tons of sand spread across an 11- acre lagoon.\ The beach, a popular hangout for the resort's gambling-bound vacationers, is increasingly playing host to another set of guests - those attending trade shows and meetings at the hotel's 1.8 million- square-foot convention center. Since January, when Mandalay Bay opened the center at the foot of the famous Strip, some convention groups have rented out the entire beach for a clambake or live rock concert.\ The $236 million convention center has allowed Mandalay Bay to keep conventioneers on site to meet, sleep, eat and be entertained. It's a facility so large and unique that it can only intensify the already stiff competition in the industry, experts say.\ As the owner of the largest privately owned convention center, Mandalay Resort Groups, owner of Mandalay and 14 other mostly Nevada resorts, finds itself with distinct advantages over publicly owned centers around the country.\ Publicly owned centers are typically built by cities to generate economic impact through visitor spending. They are not structured to make a profit, and have no control over hotel room supply or rates and reap no revenue from other amenities.\ But privately owned centers can offer a single contract covering meeting and exhibit space and hotel rooms. The resorts that typically hold such conventions also operate restaurants, shops and entertainment; Mandalay Bay has 16 restaurants, the Shark Reef aquarium, the House of Blues concert hall, and of course, a casino.\ ""Mandalay Bay has far more flexibility as far as selling exhibit space vs. hotel rooms if it's an overall package,"" said Debra Dignan, vice president of convention sales for the Baltimore Area Convention and Visitors Association. ""A center here cannot be flexible with pricing because we don't have hotel rooms to offset revenue. [A private center] has other revenue sources to offset the pricing. They can discount one aspect and make it up in another revenue source.""\ Baltimore has competed directly with Mandalay Bay just once and isn't likely to square off against it in most cases. But it can't help but feel the pinch of the additional space at a time when convention business has leveled off, convention experts said.\ Demand for convention space has contracted by 5 percent over the last two years, while new space has grown by about 5 percent a year, said Michael Hughes, director of research for industry magazine Tradeshow Week. Some 60 centers are being expanded or built, he said.\ Baltimore has been feeling the squeeze ever since it tripled the convention center's size in 1997. The expanded center has never fulfilled projections. In fact, bookings have been declining even as the visitors association continues to search for a new convention bureau chief.\ ""We are certainly now in a period that is far more competitive than it ever had been, with cities increasingly relying on discounts and cash incentives to lure meetings,"" said Heywood T. Sanders, a professor of public administration at the University of Texas and a convention industry expert.\ ""I don't think it's necessarily likely that an event held in Baltimore will shift to Las Vegas as a result of this, but ... what may happen is that events that might normally be in Chicago or New Orleans may choose to shift to Las Vegas, and a Chicago or New Orleans, faced with that competitive pressure, will seek to get events that might well have been Baltimore's focus,"" Sanders said. ""Everyone faces a much more difficult, much more cutthroat and much less predictable competitive environment.""\ Mandalay Bay is not the first large hotel operator to aggressively court conventioneers by packaging rooms with a convention center. The owners of the Italian-themed Venetian Hotel Resort Casino, also on the Las Vegas strip, operate the 1.7 million- square-foot Sands Expo and Convention Center, while Gaylord Entertainment developed Gaylord Opryland Nashville, also a hotel and convention center under one roof. And for many years, large hotels have often included smaller meeting spaces in their projects.\ But Mandalay Bay has taken the strategy to a new level. The resort owns three hotels next to one another, Mandalay Bay, Luxor and Excalibur, with a total 12,000 rooms. Mandalay Bay also is building a 1,122-suite tower designed specifically to accommodate business travelers.\ The hotels are a short walk or a tram-ride away from the convention center and fall into three distinct pricing categories.\ ""What's unique about Mandalay Bay is that they own just so many hotel rooms ... and what's interesting there is that they're offering at least three unique price points for event attendees, so the breadth of their hotel room price point offering is unique, from high-end to quite low,"" Hughes said.\ That's an attractive proposition for an event planner, said Kelly Schulz, a spokeswoman for Meeting Planners International.\ ""Meeting planners right now are stretched for time; they are having to do more work under tighter budgets with fewer staff members and less resources,"" Schulz said. ""Anything that can be a one-stop convenient stop with one contract and one location and one negotiating point is going to be easier for them, and save them time and expense.""\ By tapping into business travelers attending large conventions, Mandalay Resort Group expects big payoffs in higher midweek hotel occupancies and increased revenue for the group's hotels, casinos, restaurants and other services.\ ""We recognized that this segment could be very profitable,"" said Danielle Babilino, Mandalay Bay's vice president of sales. ""Business travelers are on an expense account, and they do a lot of entertaining and discretionary spending. Their budget is larger than leisure guests. And if a business traveler has a good experience, he will come back for a vacation.""\ The company's first-quarter earnings report - the first since the convention center opened - indicates initial success. For the three months that ended April 30, the flagship Mandalay Bay hotel emerged as the group's standout performer, with average room rates topping $200 - the highest ever quarterly mark. The company credited its success to the new convention center's 19 trade show bookings, the first of more than 60 the center has booked this year.\ ""This is the newest and latest version of convention space in the world,"" Glenn Schaeffer, Mandalay Resort Group's president and chief financial officer, said during a recent conference call with analysts. ""We have a star in the making.""\ Before Mandalay Bay built its three-level center, which features the largest hotel ballroom in the nation and corporate-style boardrooms with high-back leather chairs, the 4-year-old hotel had about 100,000 square feet of conference space, with convention guests representing about 18 percent of the hotel's occupancy.\ ""We wanted to grow that,"" said Babilino, adding that the company anticipated booking large groups that had never been able to get convention space in Las Vegas during peak times. ""We went into this knowing we had business in our back pocket.""\ So far, Mandalay has lured two big meetings from other venues. The Promotional Products Association International conference, with 20,000 conventioneers, was drawn away from Dallas, where it had been held for 26 years, and Snowsports Industries of America, with 25,000 convention-goers, was lured away from its annual home at the Las Vegas Convention Center.\ Increased business for Mandalay Bay should translate into increased business for Las Vegas as a destination and solidify the city's ranking as North America's top convention destination, ahead of New York and Toronto, convention experts say.\ ""It does benefit the meeting industry across the destination because we can host more concurrent shows citywide than we ever have before,"" said Erika Brandvik, a spokeswoman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. ""While the meeting industry has been in decline, Las Vegas has not felt the pinch of that decline. We've been growing.""\ Credit: SUN STAFF"
169," We may not have an economic crisis yet. But you can tell there's a perceived political crisis when President Bush starts to imitate Jimmy Car- ter.\ On Monday Bush asked all Americans to be ""better conservers of energy"" by skipping nonessential driving. ""We can all pitch in,"" he said, according to transcription services.\ Bush also urged federal employees to carpool or use mass-transit and said the government would shift electricity use to off-peak hours, reducing demand when the grid is stressed.\ It was reminiscent of when former President Carter donned a sweater, sat by a fire and asked Americans to save energy by turning down thermostats during the natural gas shortages of the late 1970s.\ And it was a striking nod to ""demand-side"" management from an administration that once seemed to believe voracious energy use is an American birthright, and the heck with consequences.\ ""Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it cannot be the basis of a sound energy policy,"" Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2001, as noted by numerous news organizations.\ Asked the same year whether people should change lifestyles to alleviate an energy crisis, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ""That's a big no,"" adding, ""The president believes that it's an American way of life, and it should the goal of policymakers to protect the American way of life.""\ Now former oilman Bush is asking Americans to give up a little slice of their way of life for the greater good, at least temporarily.\ It's political crisis control as much as economic. With 2006 elections approaching, the administration has been blasted for appearing uncaring and aloof as millions suffer from storms and high gas prices.\ Spouting an ""all-for-one"" line lets Bush fly the flag of communitarian sacrifice without anybody worrying he'll actually enforce it. (Carter, on the other hand, gave the impression he would personally inspect your thermostat AND the wool content of your sweaters.)\ But the short-term vitality of the economy is threatened, too.\ Consumer confidence has plunged, retail sales are weak, and high energy prices could lead to lackluster holiday shopping, which would be even worse for Republicans next year than the perception that they're detached corporate lackeys.\ By my calculation oil prices have now increased enough since 2003 to take more than $100 billion out of Americans' pockets each year. At less than 2 percent of annual personal consumption of $8 trillion or so, that's not an enormous amount.\ But it's getting to the point where it could make a difference, and people on both sides of the political aisle in Washington are starting to talk about remedies.\ On Monday presidential spokesman Scott McClellan again urged Congress to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, a move that would do little to change petroleum prices or make the country energy-secure but could irreparably sully our natural heritage.\ People also are talking again about expanding coastal oil drilling, another risk that might cost more in environmental harm than it would deliver in energy benefits. Congressional Republicans are floating the idea of oil-refinery tax breaks for an industry that is making record profits, which doesn't make much more sense than Democratic proposals to expropriate oil-company assets through a ""windfall profits"" tax. (Another Carter-era idea.)\ Some of the administration's short-term supply remedies make sense. Tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and temporarily relaxing shipping and environmental emissions rules can ease the temporary crunch, if that's what it is.\ But long term, the biggest policy gains are to be had on the demand side - and not by encouraging cardigans and fewer drives to Wal-Mart. Stricter mileage standards would simultaneously reduce gas usage, improve the environment and promote safety by discouraging unnecessarily heavy vehicles.\ A bigger gas tax would further discourage petroleum use, encourage alternatives and finance federal research on fuel cells and solar power. Together they might forestall a real crisis in the future, with even more opportunities for mischief."
170,"
The energy report that began Gov. Martin O'Malley's tenure in Annapolis pulled no punches - and described a system as broken as his recent efforts to stop electricity rate hikes.
\
Soaring bills that arrive each month in Marylanders' mailboxes are not due to rising rates alone; the incomplete, inept, and incapable state energy system also is to blame.
\
In response, Mr. O'Malley's administration has begun the nascent steps of creating an energy policy aimed to prevent future situations like the 50 percent Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. rate increase that took effect on June 1.
\
""Maryland is not well prepared to face future energy challenges and impending energy crises,"" said the first sentence in the ""Major Findings"" section of the 2007 Energy Transition Report. ""Years of benign neglect by the state government have resulted in disarray and loss of leadership with regard to energy policy.""
\
What follows in the report are a litany of problems: electricity consumption rising about 15 times faster than generation between 1999 and 2005; out-of-state imports at 28 percent and rising; $500 million in costs caused by congested transmission; utility jobs and taxes being sent out of Maryland and as far away as Indiana.
\
""There is not significant awareness among the public, the legislature or the press and media about critical energy matters to build the consensus needed to form and adopt the best energy solutions for the state,"" the report says. ""Energy policy decisions that will vitally affect our state's economy, environment and households for many decades should not be taken in a climate too heavily influenced by single-issue politics, demagoguery and short- term solutions.""
\
A single-issue, however - the BGE increases - has provided a platform for the Governor's Office to preach the necessity of stepping out of Maryland's energy mess.
\
""We have to do a much better job of planning ahead and acting now,"" Mr. O'Malley said this month while introducing Malcolm Woolf as the new director of the Maryland Energy Administration. ""(A strategy) empowers consumers, instead of making us feel like victims.""
\
In a recent interview, Mr. Woolf talked about how the state cannot focus on just large solutions such as increasing coal plants or building new natural gas or nuclear power facilities.
\
While those options will stay on the table, he said, each resident also needs to take personal responsibility in reducing their consumption and easing the strain on Maryland's grid.
\
The state must increase supply and decrease demand, Mr. Woolf said.
\
""There are tremendous opportunities,"" he said. ""It doesn't take that much to dramatically reduce rates.""
\
'Little legal option'
\
Mr. O'Malley's first television ad of the gubernatorial campaign was a stark statement about the need for better energy decisions.
\
Against a background of an exasperated woman opening up expensive energy bills, a voice describes how former governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. and BGE failed Marylanders.
\
""The special interests already have their governor. We need one of our own,"" the ad says. ""Martin O'Malley - taking on BGE to stop the rate hikes.""
\
That result, however, did not happen.
\
In the Public Service Commission's May 23 decision on the BGE increases, there was ""reluctance, but little legal option"" to prevent the 50 percent hike.
\
The decision outlines a catalogue of flawed policies that backed the state into a corner: the transfer of BGE to a for-profit, private corporation; artificial rate caps that did not correlate to overall skyrocketing costs; creating a purchasing time schedule that was limiting and restrained, essentially allowing BGE to get most of its supply during the price explosion after hurricanes Katrina and Rita; and the failure of the PSC to act in any proactive, pro- consumer manner.
\
Although the energy plan itself is still in its infancy, the administration is confident it is creating an atmosphere that is less cozy with business interests.
\
Despite the BGE increases, the governor also has appointed people to the PSC who will be watchdogs for Maryland residents, said Rick Abbruzzese, a spokesman.
\
""Within weeks of taking office he has done that,"" Mr. Abbruzzese said. ""The governor is disappointed but in four months there is little you can do to change four years.""
\
Mr. O'Malley also signed a bill requiring the PSC to undertake studies into the availability of transmission and generation capacity and the options for re-regulating electricity. Up to $3 million can be spent for completing the work.
\
Ironically, the costs of the study will be paid by the utility companies - expenses the legislation acknowledges will at least partially be passed on to consumers.
\
New tactics
\
Maryland's bleak energy picture, however, goes beyond BGE and the PSC.
\
The state relies heavily on large suppliers with large facilities and congestion problems, and the regulations are onerous for renewable energy plants; more than 75 percent of Maryland's energy generating capacity is over 21 years old, and it will be at least 2015 before two proposed nuclear reactors at Calvert Cliffs could be completed, the transition report says.
\
Tax credits, loans and grants all need to be used to encourage new energy such as solar power, Mr. Woolf said, especially because the BP Solar plant in Frederick is one of the world's largest solar panel factories.
\
Bills passed during the General Assembly session exempt solar energy devices from state property tax, provide an income tax reduction for solar power grants, and increase the amount of solar and renewable energy the state has to use starting in 2008.
\
Alternative energy, however, is still years away from becoming a huge difference maker, Mr. Woolf said.
\
""The energy world is transforming,"" he said. ""(But) that is a longer-term transformation.""
\
More than half of Maryland's electricity comes from coal, but six facilities will have to undergo costly upgrades in order to comply with the state's air requirements, according to the transition report.
\
Doing so, however, could render them useless in terms of economics. Even newer coal technology that burns much cleaner is not in a competitive stage yet, Mr. Woolf said.
\
""I don't think anything is off the table,"" he said. ""(But) the low-hanging fruit is really on the demand side. That's the beauty of demand side management.""
\
For example, replacing a quarter of an average household's light bulbs with more energy efficient versions could save more than $100 a month, he said.
\
Switching off the outlets for appliances that are not in use, upgrading to ""Energy Star"" equipment, and turning down the water heater are all ways to make a home use less energy, Mr. Woolf said.
\
""There is no silver bullet,"" he said. ""(Better energy use) is going to take lots of individual actions.""

Greg was walking down the hallway of his new school when a group of kids he hoped to become friends with asked him to cut class with them.
\
""Come on, nobody's going to math today. They're having a quiz,"" his new acquaintances said. ""John's parents aren't home, so we're going to his house for lunch. Nobody will know."" Greg stood there, frozen. He was happy that the kids were inviting him, but he was unsure of what to do.
\
It would seem that Greg's choice is an easy one, but research has shown that even the obvious isn't clear when it comes to peer pressure.
\
The power of group psychology and the tremendous influence of peer pressure has been demonstrated by a social psychology experiment in which people are asked to match one line with another line of equal length. They have to pick between three rather obvious choices. Amazingly, if the individual is placed in a group with others who intentionally make the wrong choice, the odds are that he also will make the incorrect selection in order to conform.
\
In the study, more than 75 percent of the participants made the wrong choice in an apparent effort to go along with the group. Apparently, they would rather be wrong than be out of step with the majority. In some cases, personal judgment was corrupted by the group influence, as some individuals could no longer tell if their choice was right or wrong, even though the correct answer was obvious.
\
One explanation for this phenomenon is that many people inherently possess a strong emotional desire to be in agreement with the group. This may harken back to earlier stages of human development, when the principle of ""safety in numbers"" applied. There may have been a time when going against the majority risked exclusion from the group. This in turn may have had life and death consequences, as the group offered protection and access to resources which the individual alone may not have had.
\
In modern life, peer pressure is often thought of as the powerful influence of one's friends or social group. It can affect nearly every aspect of life, including beliefs, feelings and, most of all, behavior. While adults experience peer pressure to some extent, teenagers are considered particularly susceptible because they are less likely to have established their own firm sense of autonomy and identity.
\
In fact, it's natural for children to become increasingly involved with their peer group as they grow into adolescence. At the same time, the rapid physical, emotional and social changes they are experiencing may leave them personally uncertain. This increases their dependence on their peer group for guidance as they grow away from their family but are not yet confident of themselves. For some, the added problem of a weak family structure or poor support at home may further strengthen the influence of the peer group.
\
Many destructive adolescent behaviors have been attributed to peer pressure, including the early use of drugs or alcohol, sexual promiscuity, violence, theft and lack of interest in school. In these cases, group dynamics not only lessen the individual's personal judgment, but also diffuse responsibility and increase the willingness to take risks.
\
But peer pressure isn't always a bad thing. The same influences that can promote destructive behaviors may also encourage positive behaviors, emotional growth and healthy choices. For instance, trying out for a school play, joining a club, playing on a sports team and participating in religious activities are examples of positive peer-influenced activities.
\
The observation that peer pressure can work for or against positive behavior demonstrates that youth culture is not monolithic, but offers a variety of subcultures, some of which are constructive and others which are not. Parents would be wise not to resist movement toward peer influence, but to help direct their teens into peer cultures which hold healthy ideals and practices. Youth groups that model volunteerism, respect and compassion for others can be just as influential as a street gang.
\
Strategies for coping with negative peer influences involve strengthening teens so that they have the confidence to make good choices. By providing a stable home environment filled with warmth and love, there is less chance that children will search for that satisfaction elsewhere. By nurturing self-esteem, there is encouragement to form healthier peer attachments that demonstrate respect for others. By teaching and modeling social skills and assertiveness, you empower teenagers to negotiate with others and, if needed, to say ""no"" and remove themselves from dangerous situations.
\
Ultimately, teenagers need to know that they are not ""uncool,"" ""stupid"" or ""losers"" if they choose not to participate in destructive group behaviors. They need to know that it is important to make good choices for themselves, even if some of their peers are unhappy with them or disagree with them. If ""friends"" are not able to accept them as they are or respect their decisions, then of course they may not really be friends at all.
\
Of course, in order to demonstrate this degree of independence, teenagers needs a base set of good values and a strong sense of confidence in their own decision-making.
\
Some programs that teach youth how to resist negative peer pressure actually practice phrases or responses that teenagers can use. For example, on the more diplomatic side, the following phrases can be helpful:
\
-- ""No, I can't do that, but thanks for asking.""
\
-- ""No, thanks. I'm in training.""
\
-- ""No, I'm fine.""
\
-- ""No, I've got other stuff I need to do.""
\
If the pressure is high and a more forceful response is needed, the following phrases may be more effective:
\
-- ""No. Bug off.""
\
-- ""What are you, nuts? I'm not doing that.""
\
-- ""Thanks, but no thanks.""
\
-- ""I don't think so. Get lost.""
\
Regardless of which words are used, the essential ingredients are clarity and decisiveness.
\
As Greg stood in the hallway with the group of classmates waiting for his response to their invitation, his mind worked rapidly. He heard himself say, ""Hey guys, it sounds like fun, but that's not how I want to start out here. Maybe we could get together some other time.""
\
As he walked away, Greg heard the guys whispering to each other. Then, to his surprise, they followed him to class.

173," LAS VEGAS - Much like the landmarks of Paris, Venice and New York that dot this desert town, the beach at the glitzy Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino has been created for the benefit of tourists, with a wave pool, a lazy river and 1,700 tons of sand spread across an 11- acre lagoon.\ The beach, a popular hangout for the resort's gambling-bound vacationers, is increasingly playing host to another set of guests - those attending trade shows and meetings at the hotel's 1.8 million- square-foot convention center. Since January, when Mandalay Bay opened the center at the foot of the famous Strip, some convention groups have rented out the entire beach for a clambake or live rock concert.\ The $236 million convention center has allowed Mandalay Bay to keep conventioneers on site to meet, sleep, eat and be entertained. It's a facility so large and unique that it can only intensify the already stiff competition in the industry, experts say.\ As the owner of the largest privately owned convention center, Mandalay Resort Groups, owner of Mandalay and 14 other mostly Nevada resorts, finds itself with distinct advantages over publicly owned centers around the country.\ Publicly owned centers are typically built by cities to generate economic impact through visitor spending. They are not structured to make a profit, and have no control over hotel room supply or rates and reap no revenue from other amenities.\ But privately owned centers can offer a single contract covering meeting and exhibit space and hotel rooms. The resorts that typically hold such conventions also operate restaurants, shops and entertainment; Mandalay Bay has 16 restaurants, the Shark Reef aquarium, the House of Blues concert hall, and of course, a casino.\ ""Mandalay Bay has far more flexibility as far as selling exhibit space vs. hotel rooms if it's an overall package,"" said Debra Dignan, vice president of convention sales for the Baltimore Area Convention and Visitors Association. ""A center here cannot be flexible with pricing because we don't have hotel rooms to offset revenue. [A private center] has other revenue sources to offset the pricing. They can discount one aspect and make it up in another revenue source.""\ Baltimore has competed directly with Mandalay Bay just once and isn't likely to square off against it in most cases. But it can't help but feel the pinch of the additional space at a time when convention business has leveled off, convention experts said.\ Demand for convention space has contracted by 5 percent over the last two years, while new space has grown by about 5 percent a year, said Michael Hughes, director of research for industry magazine Tradeshow Week. Some 60 centers are being expanded or built, he said.\ Baltimore has been feeling the squeeze ever since it tripled the convention center's size in 1997. The expanded center has never fulfilled projections. In fact, bookings have been declining even as the visitors association continues to search for a new convention bureau chief.\ ""We are certainly now in a period that is far more competitive than it ever had been, with cities increasingly relying on discounts and cash incentives to lure meetings,"" said Heywood T. Sanders, a professor of public administration at the University of Texas and a convention industry expert.\ ""I don't think it's necessarily likely that an event held in Baltimore will shift to Las Vegas as a result of this, but ... what may happen is that events that might normally be in Chicago or New Orleans may choose to shift to Las Vegas, and a Chicago or New Orleans, faced with that competitive pressure, will seek to get events that might well have been Baltimore's focus,"" Sanders said. ""Everyone faces a much more difficult, much more cutthroat and much less predictable competitive environment.""\ Mandalay Bay is not the first large hotel operator to aggressively court conventioneers by packaging rooms with a convention center. The owners of the Italian-themed Venetian Hotel Resort Casino, also on the Las Vegas strip, operate the 1.7 million- square-foot Sands Expo and Convention Center, while Gaylord Entertainment developed Gaylord Opryland Nashville, also a hotel and convention center under one roof. And for many years, large hotels have often included smaller meeting spaces in their projects.\ But Mandalay Bay has taken the strategy to a new level. The resort owns three hotels next to one another, Mandalay Bay, Luxor and Excalibur, with a total 12,000 rooms. Mandalay Bay also is building a 1,122-suite tower designed specifically to accommodate business travelers.\ The hotels are a short walk or a tram-ride away from the convention center and fall into three distinct pricing categories.\ ""What's unique about Mandalay Bay is that they own just so many hotel rooms ... and what's interesting there is that they're offering at least three unique price points for event attendees, so the breadth of their hotel room price point offering is unique, from high-end to quite low,"" Hughes said.\ That's an attractive proposition for an event planner, said Kelly Schulz, a spokeswoman for Meeting Planners International.\ ""Meeting planners right now are stretched for time; they are having to do more work under tighter budgets with fewer staff members and less resources,"" Schulz said. ""Anything that can be a one-stop convenient stop with one contract and one location and one negotiating point is going to be easier for them, and save them time and expense.""\ By tapping into business travelers attending large conventions, Mandalay Resort Group expects big payoffs in higher midweek hotel occupancies and increased revenue for the group's hotels, casinos, restaurants and other services.\ ""We recognized that this segment could be very profitable,"" said Danielle Babilino, Mandalay Bay's vice president of sales. ""Business travelers are on an expense account, and they do a lot of entertaining and discretionary spending. Their budget is larger than leisure guests. And if a business traveler has a good experience, he will come back for a vacation.""\ The company's first-quarter earnings report - the first since the convention center opened - indicates initial success. For the three months that ended April 30, the flagship Mandalay Bay hotel emerged as the group's standout performer, with average room rates topping $200 - the highest ever quarterly mark. The company credited its success to the new convention center's 19 trade show bookings, the first of more than 60 the center has booked this year.\ ""This is the newest and latest version of convention space in the world,"" Glenn Schaeffer, Mandalay Resort Group's president and chief financial officer, said during a recent conference call with analysts. ""We have a star in the making.""\ Before Mandalay Bay built its three-level center, which features the largest hotel ballroom in the nation and corporate-style boardrooms with high-back leather chairs, the 4-year-old hotel had about 100,000 square feet of conference space, with convention guests representing about 18 percent of the hotel's occupancy.\ ""We wanted to grow that,"" said Babilino, adding that the company anticipated booking large groups that had never been able to get convention space in Las Vegas during peak times. ""We went into this knowing we had business in our back pocket.""\ So far, Mandalay has lured two big meetings from other venues. The Promotional Products Association International conference, with 20,000 conventioneers, was drawn away from Dallas, where it had been held for 26 years, and Snowsports Industries of America, with 25,000 convention-goers, was lured away from its annual home at the Las Vegas Convention Center.\ Increased business for Mandalay Bay should translate into increased business for Las Vegas as a destination and solidify the city's ranking as North America's top convention destination, ahead of New York and Toronto, convention experts say.\ ""It does benefit the meeting industry across the destination because we can host more concurrent shows citywide than we ever have before,"" said Erika Brandvik, a spokeswoman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. ""While the meeting industry has been in decline, Las Vegas has not felt the pinch of that decline. We've been growing.""\ Credit: SUN STAFF"
174,"Has Gov. Martin O'Malley's broad array of tax increase proposals got you bummed out? Cheer up, there's a bright spot.\If Mr. O'Malley succeeds in his plan to impose Maryland's 6 percent sales tax on the purchase of gasoline, he will not only boost revenues for long-overdue highway, bridge and mass transit projects but possibly help clean the Chesapeake Bay at the same time -- a formula that could work not just in Maryland but in all of the bay states. \Up to one-third of the nitrogen that pollutes the bay and its rivers comes from the air, and much of that comes from motor vehicle emissions. Thus, to the extent that Marylanders find the higher gas tax so burdensome that they drive less or trade up to more fuel-efficient vehicles, the bay gets a little breathing space. \Cheap energy is a curse to the environment. So, driving up the cost of gasoline is an effective countermeasure. \Now, there are caveats: If gasoline tax revenue comes in lower than expected, there may not be enough to invest to in mass transit projects, which also serve the bay. If drivers seeking fuel efficiency switch to electric cars, that may not help much either. Electricity comes mostly from coal, which adds mightily to air and water pollution. \Nonetheless, the concept of raising the federal gasoline tax as an environmental tactic has won broad support from prominent economists in both political parties over the last two decades. As an early warrior against global warming, Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kerry was famously in favor of a 50-cent-per-gallon federal gasoline tax increase -- before he was against it as a presidential candidate. \Yes, the political challenge is not for the timid. But raising the gasoline tax has many potential benefits beyond extra money and perhaps cleaner air. Chief among those benefits is that a higher tax makes drivers pay more of the true cost of their burden on society. \""A gas tax is an indirect way of making people pay when their massive vehicles impose risk on others, which in turn makes them take account of this risk when choosing whether to buy some monster urban-assault vehicle or go with a sensible compact."" That was Harvard economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw writing on behalf of a 50-cent-per-gallon gas hike back in 1999 -- before he served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to President George W. Bush. \Raising the gasoline tax is cheaper and more efficient than tightening federal fuel efficiency standards on vehicles as a means to fight global warming and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, according to the Congressional Budget Office. \During those years when a federal gas tax increase was being considered, proponents of what a New York Times headline dubbed the ""50-cent-a-gallon solution"" typically proposed to balance the wallop at the pump with a break on income or other taxes. \Governor O'Malley is proposing the opposite: He wants to raise income and other taxes, too. On gasoline, he's only asking 6 percent a gallon, levied at the wholesale level and thus not immediately visible at the pump. At today's prices, that would be about 18 cents per gallon phased in over three years. But that sales tax would be added to the state's existing 23.5-cent-per-gallon excise tax, for a total of 41.5 cents per gallon. And don't forget that the feds are still collecting their 18.4 cents per gallon. \Fifty cents a gallon doesn't sound so bad now, does it? \Maryland's gasoline tax ranks in the middle of the 50 states and is in sync with bay watershed neighbors Delaware and Washington, D. C. But Mr. O'Malley's proposal would quickly leave Pennsylvania's  relatively high gas tax rate of 32.3 cents per gallon in the dust. Plus, there's the danger that low-tax Virginia -- at 17.5 cents a gallon -- would encourage folks to gas up on its side of the border. \Even so, the entire watershed would benefit if Maryland, the most densely populated bay state, starts paying for its excesses. Maybe others would feel politically safe to follow Maryland's example. \Of course, Maryland's General Assembly will try to pare back the governor's tax proposals. Neither Democrats nor Republicans want to go home and try to explain why they are picking the pockets of people already suffering through a long, painful recession. \In the case of the gasoline tax, though, something really good could come out of it, something you couldn't actually pay people to do: Take better care of the environment and the Chesapeake Bay. \Karen Hosler, a former editorial writer for the Baltimore Sun, is a reporter, commentator and talk show host in Baltimore.

175,"This week, Gov. Martin O'Malley testified in support of his plan to apply Maryland's 6 percent sales tax to gasoline, which would be the first increase in the state's gas taxes in two decades. But the plan has run into strong opposition in the General Assembly, where lawmakers are reluctant to raise the price at the pump at a time when the cost of gasoline is already on the rise. Here's a sampling of readers' responses.\Gas tax increase won't save the bay \Of all the arguments I have heard to support an increase in Maryland's gas tax, the oddest by far is the notion -- as expressed recently by Karen Hosler -- that doing so would be good for the environment (""Can a gas tax increase save the Bay?"" Feb. 26). Proponents of this theory suggest that, by raising gas prices to levels that would be painful if not impossible for working people to bear, Annapolis lawmakers could force countless families to overhaul their daily routine by leaving their cars in the driveway. Or failing that, inspire them to head to their local car dealerships to trade their current vehicles in for newer, ""greener"" models. \In better times, this notion could be gently dismissed as a well-intentioned but impractical strategy for addressing our environmental challenges. In our current economic climate, however, it reflects a callous indifference to working people throughout our state who are working harder than ever just to keep a roof over their heads, feed their families and save for college and retirement. \People need to drive to work. They need to drop their kids off at school and then take them to Little League practice. They need to run the essential errands of a typical family, from the stops at the grocery store every week to those trips to the family doctor. \Rather than cutting back on driving, people who are able to do so will cross state boundaries to purchase their gas for a significantly lower price. Those who can't will grudgingly pay the higher prices at the pump but will be forced to cut back on other purchases. Either way, Maryland's small businesses -- which create local jobs, pay state taxes and give back to their communities in countless ways -- will be adversely affected. \As a 20-year veteran of the Maryland House of Delegates and now as comptroller, I have been a passionate, consistent supporter of measures to protect the Chesapeake Bay from sprawl development while expanding our state's transit network. As the state's chief fiscal officer, though, I'm aware that the Maryland economy is still powered primarily by consumer spending. It should go without saying that we cannot revive a consumer-driven economy by digging deeper into the pockets of families who are already struggling to make ends meet. I agree with Ms. Hosler that improving the health of the Chesapeake Bay should be a priority, but the gas tax is the wrong prescription at the worst time. \Peter Franchot, Annapolis \The writer, a Democrat, is Maryland's comptroller. \Restore transportation trust fund \Maybe, instead of blustering about the need to increase the state's tax on a gallon of gas, The Sun's editorial board should support legislation to outlaw an increase in the tax until all of the money that was stolen from the Transportation Trust Fund since 1992 is returned (""Pay now or later,"" March 14). \It would also be helpful to know exactly how much has been taken from the fund since the last time the tax was increased, and who was the governor at the time that authorized it. The title of the editorial is somewhat ironic, as I feel that I have already ""paid now,"" it's just that those funds weren't spent for the purpose they were collected for. \If a private company had done this, we'd call it fraud, but here in Maryland when the government does it, we call it progress. \Paul N. Jackson, Cockeysville \Tax blues? Try Jersey \My family and I moved to Maryland in 1996 and witnessed some of the lowest tax (and car insurance) rates ever. However, we did find the gasoline tax much higher than we'd experienced, but the roads were exquisite (and I'm not kidding). \That's because we came from New Jersey. You have to have lived in the Garden State to understand why we are totally in favor of Gov. Martin O'Malley's proposed gas tax increase. Roads in New Jersey are still in the shape as we left them 16 years ago -- horrid everywhere. \We paid some of the highest income, real estate, sewer, local and school taxes (such that you Marylanders have yet to see) during the 25 years spent in that state. \We are thrilled to be Marylanders. \Judy Fowler, Arnold \There are alternatives \Your editorial (""Pay now or later,"" March 14) provides two choices to deal with our state's aging infrastructure: Raise taxes on gasoline or continue to face increasing hazardous road and bridge conditions and more gridlock for commuters. \Well, there is an alternative: Inviting the private sector in to see if they can work with the public sector in this regard. In my book, ""Public-Private Partnerships -- Case Studies on Infrastructure Development,"" I include many examples of public-private partnerships to improve roads, bridges and tunnels by permitting the private sector to invest in revenue-producing infrastructure that can accomplish several goals. For example"" \1) Providing lump sum payments to obtain a long lease on an existing toll road where the toll structure is negotiated between lessee and lessor. The lessee operates, maintains and improves the toll road in return for a reasonable return on their investment via collection of tolls. \2) The lessee may add high-occupancy lanes that create tolls with a higher rate during morning and evening rush hours. Commuters willing to pay slightly more can move along quite rapidly if they chose so. In both cases, only users pay these fees, as it should be, and non-users don't. Truck-only lanes, created in the median strip of existing highways, take these large vehicles off the highway and allow trailer caravans to operate more safely and at significant savings to fuel costs and reduction in exhaust fumes -- and create more room for passengers cars. \The case for increased, efficient public transportation can also reduce congestion and, according to the American Public Transportation Association, public transportation annually saves 4.2 billion gallons of gasoline and reduces our nation's carbon emissions by 37 million metric tons. So how is that for a triple threat -- reduces traffic, saves energy, improves the environment. The term ""thinking outside the box"" is overused nowadays, but perhaps the state should apply that to alternate methods to improve our transportation systems. \Sidney M.

176,"Howard County's business leaders want expensive new roads and interchanges, but they would rather not have the state increase the gasoline tax to pay for it, according to this year's list of General Assembly priorities from the Chamber of Commerce.\Without the higher taxes, the new roads might be impossible, chamber leaders acknowledged at the group's annual legislative breakfast yesterday at the Columbia Hilton. They have another solution in mind -- one with which several of the General Assembly's top Republicans agree.\They want to remove the state's mass transit programs from the Transportation Trust Fund. It's unfair, they say, for gasoline taxes to support both mass transit and highways. It's also unfair, Republican leaders said, to raise taxes when the state is boasting surpluses estimated at $250 million.\""We do not believe that a gas tax increase is appropriate for funding of transit operating expense increases,"" said Dwight Clark, an attorney who is the chamber's vice president for governmental affairs. He said, however, that building interchanges along U.S. 29 and Route 175 and widening parts of Routes 216 and 32 are the chamber's highest priorities. If a tax increase is the only way to fund those projects, then the chamber would support one, Clark said.\Gov. Parris N. Glendening has called for a gas tax increase, and a panel has been appointed to examine the issue.\The chamber also wants legislation requiring convicted criminals to serve at least 50 percent of their sentences -- even if it means building more prisons -- and state budget surpluses devoted to one- time projects ""that do not create future funding requirements or mandates.""\The group of about 60 business leaders presented legislators a list of priorities in economic development, education, training, environment and public safety.\Attorney Thomas M. Meachum said that if longer prison sentences are recommended, the chamber should also recommend more treatment and education to combat drug and alcohol abuse.\""We ought to address a public health program. How can we help them rather than just sending them to prison?"" he said.\Removing mass transit from the trust fund would free about 42 percent of the fund's $1.9 billion in annual spending, state officials say, and it would put the transit programs in the state's general budget, where costs could be trimmed. Only 35 percent of the fund is spent annually on highway projects, a spokesman said.\""It would get more scrutiny in the general fund,"" Del. Robert H. Kittleman, House minority leader and a Howard Republican, said after the breakfast. ""State bus drivers get twice as much as those in the private sector. Eighty percent of mass transit budgets are salaries.""\Howard Republican Martin G. Madden, the Senate minority leader, agreed.\""I favor looking at that formula. This is not the time to be talking about raising the gas tax,"" he said.\After the breakfast, state Sen. Edward J. Kasemeyer, a Howard Democrat and deputy majority leader, said he disagreed. County Executive James N. Robey, a Democrat, attended the breakfast, but said later he didn't know enough about the issue to form an opinion.\""It's going to have to be this year or next,"" Kasemeyer said of the proposed gas tax increase, adding that he doesn't think mass transit is likely to be removed from the trust fund.\The state tax on gasoline -- last raised in 1992 -- is now 23.5 cents a gallon. That and Motor Vehicle Administration licensing and title transfer fees provide the roughly $2 billion the transportation fund receives and spends each year.\But state Transportation Department spokesman Jack Calahan said the trust fund has a built-in financing problem. While construction and transit system costs increase annually because of inflation, the fund's income remains flat without legislative action to increase either the tax or the fees.\Without an increase in the fund's income, ""the ability to add new projects diminishes"" after 2000, he said.\A 5-cent gas tax increase would add about $140 million a year.\{GEOGRAPHY} Howard County"
177,"The last time Maryland's gasoline tax was raised, the first President Bush was in office, Gov. William Donald Schaefer was near the height of his political power and the price of a gallon of regular was a little more than $1.\Now Gov. Martin O'Malley's administration is faced with swelling infrastructure costs and a state Transportation Trust Fund in urgent need of a cash infusion. Leading lawmakers say they expect O'Malley to propose an increase in Maryland's 23.5 cents-a-gallon tax and possibly recommend other measures, such as a sales tax on gasoline and tying future increases to inflation or construction costs.\Maryland Transportation Secretary John D. Porcari said in an interview this week that he supports changing the method of taxing gas, from one based on the gallon to one tied to rising prices.\Noting that some other states link their gas taxes to the Consumer Price Index, Porcari suggested that Maryland would be better served by aligning taxes with the less well-known Construction Cost Index. He said the prices of road- and bridge-building materials - cement and steel, among others - are rising annually by up to 50 percent.\""We think it makes a lot of sense to do that because it more accurately reflects the cost of our raw materials,"" Porcari said. He said that indexing Maryland's gas prices that way could bring in an additional $63 million a year.\O'Malley has yet to specify what his transportation tax package will include, but political will potentially exists in the Democrat-dominated legislature for an increase in the flat gas tax.\Maryland's gas tax of 23.5 cents a gallon compares with 19.6 cents in Virginia, 20 cents in the District of Columbia, 23 cents in Delaware, 31.5 cents in West Virginia and 32.3 cents in Pennsylvania. The figures represent a combination of taxes in some states.\For now, Maryland falls squarely in the middle of U.S. states in terms of its gas tax. Increases on the scale being discussed in Annapolis could catapult Maryland into the top ranks - but other states with similar unmet needs could soon be forced to catch up.\Other options abound. Vehicle registration fees are a potential revenue source, though lawmakers might be wary after Republican Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.'s near-doubling of them. The titling tax -paid when a vehicle is purchased - could also go up.\Porcari mentioned that a sales tax could be imposed on top of the gas tax. Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, a Democrat, suggested that a larger portion of the corporate income tax could also go to transportation.\Sources close to the governor said this week that these possibilities are all on the table.\The debate in Annapolis, meanwhile, is bound to be charged as lawmakers simultaneously grapple with how to address a $1.5 billion general fund shortfall. In accounting terms, the transportation fund problem and the so-called structural deficit are separate issues, but politically they are sure to be intertwined.\O'Malley has committed to getting a viable transportation package passed during the 2008 General Assembly session. He said traffic congestion is taking its toll on Maryland's roads and the costs of building and maintaining bridges and roads have skyrocketed.\""Our roads and bridges will not wait until the right political timing, the ideal gas price or the best fiscal environment,"" O'Malley, a Democrat, said during the Maryland Association of Counties conference in Ocean City.\Maryland spends roughly $2 billion a year on transportation. The gas tax, which yields $800 million annually, is the largest single source of state funds.\But transportation advocates believe Maryland needs to raise an additional $400 million to $600 million annually to adequately address $40 billion in unmet infrastructure needs.\However, O'Malley faces a different political dynamic than fellow Democrat Schaefer did in the early 1990s, when road-building was curtailed by an anemic trust fund and the state was in the grip of a recession that had idled many construction workers.\Back then, some leading Republicans were among the loudest proponents of Schaefer's proposal to raise the state gas tax - then 18.5 cents a gallon - by 5 cents. Robert R. Neall, then the Anne Arundel County executive and a former House Republican leader, was a staunch backer of the increase. Five Republican senators - but no delegates - backed the Schaefer revenue package that included the gas tax increase.\Neall said that in those days there was a group of moderate Republicans who would evaluate tax increase proposals on a case-by-case basis.\""We were not just reflexively anti-tax,"" said Neall, who later served in the Maryland Senate and eventually defected to the Democratic side before being defeated for re-election in 2002.\Next year O'Malley can expect little help from the opposition party. State Republicans are expected to dig in firmly against any major tax increase.\House Minority Leader Anthony J. O'Donnell, a Republican from Southern Maryland, said the GOP caucus ""would be fairly united in opposition to a gas tax.""\O'Donnell also said he would oppose any attempt to index Maryland's gas tax.\""I believe that the citizens expect us to manage that on an annual basis,"" he said. ""[Indexing] amounts to an automatic tax increase, and I think that is probably a bad idea. We need to be able to shift priorities when it's warranted.""\O'Donnell also said Maryland should tackle the budget shortfall before considering transportation needs. But his position runs counter to that of some leading business groups.\Donald C. Fry, president of the Greater Baltimore Committee, said Maryland will find itself ""mired in gridlock in the future"" if its transportation woes are ignored.\""The magnitude of the need for transportation projects to maintain the mobility of our people and goods and services is just growing,"" Fry said. ""My guess is to get to that $400 million figure you'd probably have to have a combination of things, including a gas tax, and perhaps even indexing that gasoline tax to inflation.""\In 2004, Ehrlich put the idea of a gas tax increase on the table as part of the discussion of a roughly $300 million-a-year transportation revenue package, but he pulled it off after meeting almost unanimous resistance from GOP legislators. He eventually won passage of a $238 million package based largely on a hefty increase in vehicle registration fees.\Miller, who called for gas tax increases during the previous two gubernatorial administrations, said he doesn't anticipate any Republican votes in favor of increased revenue for the trust fund.\Miller said he expects any vote in the Senate, where a supermajority would be needed to pass a revenue package in the event of a filibuster, to be close.\""It's going to be one or two votes at the most,"" he said. ""It's a daunting task, but we're up to it.""\The lack of a bipartisan consensus on the gas tax is among the reasons no Maryland governor has proposed an increase in 15 years. It represents the second-longest interval between gas tax increases since the state's first such levy - 1 cent a gallon - was adopted in 1921. By contrast, the tax went up three times during the 1980s.\Jack Kinstlinger, chairman emeritus of the engineering firm KCI Technologies Inc. in Hunt Valley and a longtime advocate of transportation infrastructure spending, said there was a time when taxes - the gasoline levy in particular - were ""less toxic"" politically.\""At one time, people expected it to be increased regularly, and they saw it as more of a user fee than a tax,"" he said.\That argument prevailed in the 1920s, when Maryland and most other states adopted gas taxes. Farm organizations were among the biggest boosters of the tax, which was seen as a fairer way of financing road improvements than property taxes - the previously prevailing source of transportation revenue.\More recently, rural legislators have soured on the gas tax - reasoning that their constituents tend to drive longer distances than urban voters. Lawmakers from farm districts also frequently object to the use of the transportation fund to support mass transit projects.\The idea of indexing the gasoline tax to inflation is not new. Neall noted that previous transportation secretaries going back to the first - Harry R. Hughes - have raised the idea of indexing the gas tax, only to be rebuffed each time by a General Assembly wary of ceding its powers.\""The legislature purposely shied away from any automatic escalator because they like the secretary of transportation to come see them,"" Neall said. ""When the Department of Transportation adequately made its case in 1982 and 1987 and 1992, the legislature responded with the revenue.""\Those increases came in smaller increments - 2 to 5 cents at a time - than the increases being suggested now. During the past legislative session, Miller floated a proposal to increase the tax by 12 cents, which would have raised $400 million in the first year. The House considered a 10-cent increase.\Neall, who now runs a Johns Hopkins health care subsidiary, said it might have been better if the state had raised the tax in smaller steps over the past decade and a half:\""When you leave it go for so long, then only a large increase will get you the money you need.""\jennifer.skalka@baltsun.com michael.dresser@baltsun.com\Mid-Atlantic gas taxes\Virginia ......................... 19.6 cents per gallon\District of Columbia .......................20 cents\Delaware ..........................................23 cents\Maryland .........................................23.5 cents\West Virginia ..................................31.5 cents\Pennsylvania ..................................32.3 cents\[Source: American Petroleum Institute; reflects rates effective July 1]\Sources of money\Gov. Martin O'Malley and state lawmakers are expected to consider a range of measures next legislative session to address a $40 billion shortfall in state transportation funding. They include:\Raising the gas tax\Maryland's gas tax hasn't been raised since 1992. At 23.5 cents per gallon, the state ranks 26th in the nation for the tax. State Republicans have said they would oppose an increase, but Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., among other key figures, has indicated his support. Miller proposed a 12-cent increase during the 2007 legislative session.\Indexing the gas tax\To account for inflation, some states link their gas tax to the Consumer Price Index. Prices then automatically go up without lawmakers' review, a point that irks many Republicans. Maryland Transportation Secretary John D. Porcari says he believes it is more efficient to tie the gas tax to a construction price index, an effort to account for the rising cost of road construction materials such as concrete and steel.\Levying the sales tax on gas\Some states impose a sales tax on top of the excise tax. California, for example, has a 6 percent sales tax and a 1.25 percent county tax on gas and allows localities to institute additional sales taxes. Florida, Hawaii, Georgia, Michigan, Illinois and Indiana also impose sales taxes.\Raising vehicle registration and title fees\In an effort to avoid any tax increase, former Republican Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. raised the biennial vehicle registration fee in 2004. Fees for passenger cars increased from $81 to $128, and sport utility vehicle and truck fees went up from $108 to $180. Raising titling fees - a one-time charge imposed when a vehicle is purchased - could provide additional cash.\Tapping corporate income tax revenues\About a quarter of the money collected via the state's corporate income tax is funneled into the Transportation Trust Fund. Lawmakers could choose to divert a larger portion of the tax revenues.\Credit: Sun reporters"
178,"A new crop of legislators comes to Annapolis on Wednesday for the start of the General Assembly's annual 90-day session, but some of them may quickly start to wonder why they did so much campaigning to get what looks to be a pretty miserable job for the foreseeable future. If the governor is joking that he's surprised someone sent him a mail bomb before he submitted the budget he's working on, you know things are looking grim. Here's our guide to what are likely to be the biggest items this year.\Budget\The most recent estimates peg the gap between projected revenues and expenses next fiscal year at about $1.6 billion. The legislature's Spending Affordability Committee recently recommended that the state set a goal of making one-third of its budget balancing exercise ongoing rather than one-time cuts or fund transfers - thus setting Maryland on a path toward a sustainable budget within four years. Gov. Martin O'Malley has pledged to propose a balanced budget without any tax increases, and he is talking for the first time about real cuts to the education budget, which has so far been spared.\Lawmakers should continue to make education their top priority, but that doesn't make its budget sacrosanct. Continuing to hold education aid harmless could force much deeper cuts in other vital programs, such as health care. And although the Spending Affordability Committee's recommendation is not binding, the governor and lawmakers should be judged on whether they hold themselves to it.\Taxes\The business community has long argued that Maryland's gas tax, which hasn't been increased in nearly 20 years, has failed to adequately fund the upkeep of the state's transportation system. And a coalition of health and disabilities advocates is making a strong push for an increase in Maryland's alcohol tax, which is among the lowest in the nation.\It's difficult to consider tax increases when the economic recovery is still tentative, but the alcohol tax can be entirely avoided by those who are financially pinched, and maintaining roads and public transportation must be considered part of the cost of driving. Maryland needs a modest increase in the gas tax and a change to make it automatically adjust for inflation, and it is long past time that the state increased its alcohol tax.\Pensions\Governor O'Malley last week said that he will not propose shifting the cost of teacher pensions to local school districts, though the legislature may do so anyway. However, the governor is likely to pursue broader changes to the state's pension and retiree health care systems to make them more affordable, following suggestions made by an advisory committee last month.\Ultimately, it makes more sense for local officials who set teachers' salaries to be responsible for pensions instead of the state. Maryland's current pensions and retiree health care liabilities, which top $30 billion, are unsustainable, and the sooner the government reins them in, the better.\Same-sex marriage\Advocates believe this may be the year when the full legislature votes on overturning Maryland's decades-old ban on gay marriage. Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Allan Kittleman, the minority leader, has proposed an alternative bill that would establish civil unions for gay and straight couples alike.\Mr. Kittleman's proposal doesn't go far enough, but it's a sign of how much times have changed that the Republican leader in the Senate would propose gay rights legislation. Lawmakers have no excuse to delay any longer before providing true equality for all.\Slots and racing\Attorney Peter Angelos' bid for Rosecroft Raceway means he will push to allow slots there, and Penn National, a co-owner of the Maryland Jockey Club, is likely to push for them at Laurel Park. Meanwhile, the legislature will be asked to divert some of the slots money earmarked for racetrack improvements into operating cash to keep Laurel and Pimlico Race Course open.\With Maryland's slots program barely off the ground, the legislature shouldn't even consider asking voters to expand it to new sites. The proposal for shifting some of the proceeds is necessary, but lawmakers need to start asking the racing industry to provide some roadmap for how it will resurrect its business.\Alcohol regulation\Armed with a report from Comptroller Peter Franchot that Maryland can loosen its restrictions on direct shipment of wine without ill effect, lawmakers appear likely to finally take action.\But the question is whether the law will only allow consumers to buy from wineries or whether it will also allow them to buy from specialty retailers in other states. The comptroller's report advised against this, but its arguments were weak. It's also time to allow restaurants with liquor licenses to allow corkage - meaning customers can bring in their own bottles of wine and have them served with a meal for a fee.\Campaign finance\An advisory group assembled by Maryland Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler found at least 25 areas of law that need to be addressed to make elections more fair and finances more transparent. Key among them were suggestions to close loopholes that allow politicians to share unlimited amounts of money with each other through political slates, and that let developers and other business interests sidestep contribution limits by donating through a series of limited liability corporations.\Lawmakers need to finally close these loopholes, which have been around for years, and not just take Mr. Gansler up on his suggestion that contribution limits be increased. It's also time to adopt some reasonable form of public financing so that candidates for the state legislature, on a voluntary basis, can run without being beholden to deep-pocketed special interest groups. The political scandals of 2010, including the criminal investigations of some prominent Prince George's County politicians, give the matter new urgency.\Environment\Among the major environmental legislation up for debate this year will be a requirement that local governments invest more in storm water management systems - and perhaps charge homeowners and businesses a small fee to do so. Lawmakers will also grapple with whether to mandate that a portion of the state's goals for increasing use of renewable energy come from wind power.\Both measures deserve passage. Pollution from runoff is a growing problem across the state, and Maryland won't be able to meet tougher, federally enforced water quality standards unless the issue is addressed. And developers of potential offshore wind projects will need power companies to sign long-term agreements if the projects are to become financially viable.\Gun legislation\Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Police Commissioner Frederick H. Bealefeld III will urge lawmakers in Annapolis to raise the minimum penalties for first-time gun offenders from 30 days to 18 months and make the crime a felony rather than a misdemeanor; it would also raise the minimum sentence for convicted felons caught with a gun from the current three years to five years in prison.\Nearly half the city's homicides are committed by people with prior gun convictions; keeping those offenders behind bars longer could save hundreds of lives in coming years."
179,"WASHINGTON -- As Delaware Gov. Jack Markell aggressively pushes for a state gas tax increase, Sen. Tom Carper will be making a similar pitch at the federal level to help shore up a Highway Trust Fund that is fast approaching a shortfall.\Neither the federal nor the state gas tax has been increased in two decades. Carper, D-Del., whose committee assignments give him a powerful voice on such matters, said a variety of funding sources likely will have to be tapped to replenish the federal trust fund, which is projected to run out of money later this year.\One idea he supports is raising the federal tax 3 or 4 cents a year for up to four years, then indexing it to inflation. That would slowly restore the 18.4-cent tax's purchasing power to where it was when it was set in 1993, he said.\""If we think it's important to have roads that are in good shape, bridges that are not about to collapse, that our highways are efficient and in good condition, then it's worth paying for,"" Carper said. ""If we're not willing to pay for those things, we frankly shouldn't have them.""\Carper chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which is writing the next bill to renew surface transportation projects. He also sits on the Senate Finance Committee, which is in charge of paying for it.\His plan is to meet individually with his colleagues on the Finance Committee when Congress returns from recess and discuss revenue options for the Highway Trust Fund. A gas tax increase makes sense, he said, because the collection system is already in place and people who drive more end up paying a significant part of maintaining and improving the system.\""I think it's one of those things where people know we have to summon the political courage to do something,"" he said. ""Ultimately, I may come out of those meetings and say, 'there is no appetite for doing anything until after the election.' Maybe that will be the case. I hope not.""\The Highway Trust Fund, financed mainly with gas taxes, has dwindled as people drive less and vehicles become more fuel efficient. Delaware has delayed a host of transportation projects because of uncertainty caused by the federal fund's impending insolvency, according to the Delaware Department of Transportation. Insufficient funding for the state transportation fund has also put work on state road projects at risk, the department says.\Markell's proposed 10-cent increase in the state's 23-cent gas tax and more borrowing would help cover $500 million in additional transportation spending over five years. Thirty-three states have a fixed tax on motor fuels and 26 have increased their gas taxes since 1992, according to State Policy Reports.\But Markell's proposal already faces strong opposition in Delaware. The Delaware Chamber of Commerce has told him that raising the state gas tax to finance infrastructure projects should be a last resort. Talk of a potential federal hike as well further imperils Markell's ""very unpopular"" proposal with state legislators, said Delaware Senate Minority Leader Gary Simpson, R-Milford.\""This is just a bad time for the economy to be adding another tax on people's backs,"" said Simpson, who favors spending cuts over tax increases.\Markell was not available for comment. His spokesman said the governor has supported the congressional delegation's efforts to invest more in infrastructure. But Markell's plan to shore up Delaware's ""chronically underfunded"" transportation fund isn't tied to ""any particular action or inaction in Washington,"" Jonathon Dworkin said in a statement.\""The governor has called for a balanced approach to address the shortfall and has been talking about the issue with legislators and citizens around the state, because as businesses, labor organizations, and others have recognized, we must act to make our roads safer, put thousands of Delawareans to work, and promote economic development,"" Dworkin said.\Thirty percent of Delaware's major roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 20 percent of its bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, according to an analysis by TRIP, a nonprofit transportation research group, of the latest information available. Driving on roads in need of repair costs Delaware motorists $228 million a year -- $318 per motorist -- in extra vehicle repairs and operating costs, the report says.\Unless Congress provides more transportation revenue, federal funding for highway and transit improvements in Delaware could be cut by $175 million starting in October, according to TRIP.\Federal officials have told states that as the Highway Trust Fund shrinks to $4 billion, expected to happen in July, they will have to slow or stop payments on projects, which could include ongoing work along Interstate 95 and a widening of State Route 26.\That could force Delaware to use a $50 million line of credit, opened last year, to keep construction going while federal officials figure out next steps, said Shailen Bhatt, Delaware's transportation secretary.\""Until I hear that is not occurring, we're just in a very guarded mode, a very defensive posture about any of our projects with federal funding,"" Bhatt said. ""For projects that are ready to go, which could be addressing a safety issue ... I'm not going to start that project because I don't want to create new projects that I'm not going to have funding on.""\Advocacy groups and state and local transportation agencies agree the federal gas tax is too low. Democrats in Congress have tried to raise it, but Republicans have been steadfast in opposition. Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said recently there is no appetite for raising the tax this election year.\Carper said every idea for shoring up the Highway Trust Fund raises its own concerns, and he doesn't agree that lawmakers who support increasing the gas tax do so at their own political peril.\News leaked in about 24 hours, he said, when he and former Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, proposed a gas tax increase in a 2010 letter to a presidential commission studying ways to reduce the debt and deficit. Back then, a colleague told him the proposal would come back to haunt him during his re-election race in 2012.\""I just want to be able to tell my colleagues, look, George Voinovich and I proposed a penny a month (increase) for 25 months, and in my last re-election I got two-thirds of the vote,"" he said.\If lawmakers can't agree, they could transfer money from the Treasury's general fund to the Highway Trust Fund, as they've done in recent years. Since 2008, about $53 billion has been transferred to the highway fund, and the Congressional Budget Office projects the fund will require a $15 billion transfer in fiscal 2015, according to State Policy Reports. But that would add to the deficit.\Carper said he hopes it won't come to that.\""I prefer for us to take up the challenge and show some courage and take away the uncertainty for state and local governments,"" he said. ""This is terribly inefficient for state and local governments trying to plan their construction season.""\-- Contributing: Raju Chebium, Gannett Washington Bureau\Contact Nicole Gaudiano at ngaudiano@gannett.com.

180,"U.S. Sen. Tom Carper hasn't given up on a long-term solution to federal transportation funding, insisting the lame-duck Congress is the ideal opportunity for success.\With the lowest gas prices in years, Delaware's senior senator hopes lame-duck lawmakers returning to their Washington offices this week will endorse a bipartisan deal to raise the federal gas tax and sustain the dwindling Highway Trust Fund.\Nationally, the average price of gas has declined for 50 days in a row -- the longest consecutive decline since 2008, according to the auto club AAA Mid-Atlantic, and the trend could continue. The average price at Delaware pumps Friday was $2.85 a gallon, compared with $3.21 a gallon a year ago.\""It's the perfect environment to fix the problem,"" Carper said Friday. ""Consumers, frankly, wouldn't notice.""\Joshua L. Schank, president of the nonpartisan Eno Center for Transportation, agrees it's good to strike while the cost of gas is low, but he doesn't see Republicans supporting the measure, even with lame ducks.\""Most people don't know what the federal gas tax is, and they wouldn't know if it was raised. It's such a potentially insignificant amount,"" Schank said. ""It's great that somebody's trumpeting how we need to pay for transportation, but one senator does not a law make.""\During the recent recess, Carper and allies spent time continuing to grow their coalition in favor of addressing the issue before January, even listening to Republicans' thoughts on different options to fund it, he said.\The lame-duck session -- before Republicans take control of the Senate next year -- is the best time to push for the hike, said Carper, who chairs the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure.\A dozen or more lawmakers on their way out might be swayed to ""do the right thing,"" he said. The same goes for a similar number who won't run for reelection when their terms expire in 2016, Carper said.\Federal funding for highways, bridges and transit makes up roughly half of all spending on infrastructure. The Highway Trust Fund provides billions annually for state and local highway and transit projects.\It relies heavily on the 18.4 cents a gallon federal tax on gasoline -- a rate set in 1993. The tax has since lost 35 percent of its purchasing power. The highway program is now operating under a short-term bill that expires in May.\Groups from AAA to the American Trucking Association to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have implored Congress to shore up the trust fund and pass a long-term bill to address a crumbling, congested highway and freight network.\Carper would fund it over four years with a 12-cent-a-gallon increase in the gas tax, and a 20-cent increase a gallon for diesel. The tax would be indexed to increase with inflation going forward."
181,"
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) - Federal gasoline taxes should be raised up to 40 cents per gallon over five years, a special commission urged today in calling for drastic changes to fix aging bridges and roads and reduce traffic deaths.
\
The two-year study by the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission is the first to recommend broad changes after the devastating bridge collapse in Minneapolis last August. It warns that urgent action is needed to avoid future disasters.
\
Among the other recommendations by the 12-member commission:
\
Work to cut traffic fatalities in half over the next 17 years by urging states to embrace new strategies to improve safety.
\
Ease traffic congestion by expanding state and local public transit systems and highway capacity.
\
Protect the environment by smoothing traffic flow, encouraging alternative commute options such as carpooling and public transit and promoting energy-efficient construction and lighting in transit systems to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
\
Seek to develop new energy sources with new research programs costing $200 million annually over the next decade.
\
Under the proposal to raise gas taxes, the current tax of 18.4 cents per gallon would be increased by 5 cents to 8 cents annually for five years and then indexed to inflation afterward to help fix the infrastructure, expand public transit and highways as well as broaden railway and rural access.
\
Other sources of revenue could come from tolls, peak-hour ""congestion pricing"" on highways, freight fees and ticket taxes for passenger rail improvements, according to the report.
\
But the proposals for improving the nation's transportation system, which are expected to cost $225 billion each year for the next 50 years, is at risk of stalling because of internal division. The commission's chairwoman, Transportation Secretary Mary Peters, and two other members oppose gas tax increases and were issuing a dissenting opinion to the report that said private-sector investment and tolls would be sufficient.
\
The gas tax has not been increased since 1993, and recent efforts by Congress to raise it have faltered over the objections of the Bush administration. The tax increase is designed to take effect in 2009, after President Bush leaves office.
\
It is time for a ""new beginning,"" the report said, calling the current strategy of patchwork repair ""no longer acceptable.""
\
The report also calls for the country to rebuild and expand its rail network to meet a growing demand for alternatives to congested highways.

182,"As Washington politicians search for budget solutions, imagine if there were a magical revenue source that operated not unlike a national consumption tax that many conservatives prefer and would mitigate global warming to please liberals, all while helping repair America's infrastructure and strengthening our national security, to the delight of almost everyone.\Actually, such a tax already exists: It's called the federal gasoline tax, and it's been stuck at 18.4 cents per gallon for two decades. We're long overdue to increase it -- maybe even double or triple it. \When Al Gore ran president in 2000, there was a lot of scaremongering about whether an environment-focused President Gore would push to raise federal gas taxes. PBS' Jim Lehrer even challenged Mr. Gore about his tie-breaking vote as vice president in 1993 for the Clinton administration budget package that raised gas taxes a mere 4.3 cents, to 18.4 cents per gallon. \The tax hasn't budged since. And because it's 18.4 cents per gallon (not 18.4 percent), as gas prices have risen the past 20 years, either steadily via inflation or drastically because of global market pressures, the share of the total, per-gallon retail price of gas that is taxed has shrunk. The inflation-adjusted gas price during the 1990s was roughly $1.75, but in 2012 it averaged $3.50; gas taxes as a share of every gallon today are half what they were in 1993. \Of course, instead of Mr. Gore we got oilman George W. Bush and an unnecessary war in Iraq that, for those with short memories, top Bush administration officials promised would be paid for by Iraqi oil reserves. (How'd that work out again?) Panic about a few extra pennies a gallon in taxes now seems silly, given that the pre-tax retail price of gas has more than doubled in just over a decade. \When gas prices rise, some people reduce their consumption; prices then fall, because that's how markets work. Still, Americans continue to consume at high rates, despite pre-tax price increases, because demand is relatively inelastic. Had we instituted a much-smaller price increase via an extra dime or quarter per gallon in taxes, the trillions of dollars in additional spending of the past two decades would have translated into hundreds of billions of dollars in Treasury receipts instead of turning into record corporate profits for oil companies. \Federal gas taxes presently yield an estimated $25 billion to $30 billion. Conservatively, somewhere between a quarter and a half trillion dollars in tax revenues have been foregone for the sake of imposing an extra dime per gallon in taxes over the past two decades. Bottom line? If Americans are paying nearly $4 per gallon for gas, we may as well be building new roads and bridges or reducing the national deficit here at home rather than enriching oil companies and undemocratic, oil-producing regimes halfway around the world. \But wouldn't higher gas taxes hit American consumers not only at the pump directly but indirectly through higher retail prices for most consumer goods? Yes, they would. After all, as my retired truck-driver father often quipped, ""If you bought it, a truck brought it."" (Including the truck and the gas itself.) \Although that maxim is slightly less applicable today due to online commerce -- no truck brought the iTunes song you downloaded yesterday -- companies would indeed pass along the added cost of higher gas taxes to consumers. But this economic reality is precisely why higher gas taxes act as a hidden consumption tax, the revenue solution preferred by so many conservatives. \And taxing consumption via gas taxes rather than a direct sales tax offers a variety of salutary side benefits. It would motivate businesses to find efficiencies or alternative ways to transport their goods. It would reward citizens who choose to walk, bike, use public transportation or drive more fuel-efficient vehicles for work or leisure driving. \Best of all, higher gas taxes would, all else equal, reduce total national petroleum consumption, thereby lowering the pre-tax price of gas as prices responds to shrinking demand and thus reducing our overall dependence on foreign oil -- with all the national security benefits implied. \Twenty years is too long. It's time to raise the federal gas tax. \Thomas F. Schaller teaches political science at UMBC. His column appears every other Wednesday. His email is schaller67@gmail.com. Twitter: @schaller67."

Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., proposed indexing the gas tax rate to inflation. He later withdrew his amendment, deciding the time wasn't right for a vote, according to his staff.\If lawmakers can't agree, they could transfer money from the Treasury's general fund to the Highway Trust Fund, as they've done in recent years."

Toll roads fairer than gas tax hike
\
Has anyone really considered what effect an increase in the gasoline tax will have on Maryland's economy? Or on the consumer?
\
Since everything moves on the use of gasoline, an increase of 5 cents per gallon will mean that the cost of everything will have to be increased accordingly, for food, clothing, entertainment and so on.
\
I say have a user fee for the roads and bridges. Have a toll road to pay for the improvements or new construction. Larry E. Shugarman Baltimore

Chasing foibles
\
I am amazed by the press campaign challenging presidential candidate Bill Clinton's integrity, implying that he has been less than honest on certain issues such as whether or not he has ever smoked marijuana.
\
The implications are that unless Mr. Clinton is totally open and honest he is not worthy of being president.
\
Can we say that President Bush has always been totally open or honest with the public? Was President Reagan always open and honest with the public? Why do we expect or demand more from a presidential candidate than we do of the president of the United States?
\
It is an absolute disgrace that the presidential campaigns of this country concentrate on the alleged foibles of the candidates rather than on the extremely serious national issues of lack of a national economic policy that could lead to greater employment and prosperity; the unbalanced budget and $4 trillion national debt; crime; decline in education, etc. Will Americans ever grow up?

Tires as fuel
\
On June, 1991, Ohio Edison received approval from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to install a full-scale system to burn whole scrap tires at its plant in Toronto, Ohio.
\
This process has the potential of disposing up to 6 million scrap tires annually, recovering the energy equivalent of some 330,000 barrels of oil.
\
The customer will benefit through lower fuel costs and the stockholder will receive a higher dividend. If other utilities install tire-burn projects, it would reduce our dependence on imported oil. Joseph Lerner Baltimore

Hall's rosy picture
\
As I have been so often in the past, I am again offended and outraged after reading Wiley A. Hall 3rd's latest example of what I consider reverse discrimination and ignoring the facts to paint his own rosy picture of the criminal element in our city.
\
To his column, ""City students should be treated like students, not criminals,"" my simple response is, if they act like criminals, that's how they should be treated. There are good children in every school and they deserve a safe environment in which to learn.
\
How dare Mr. Hall compare the city schools with outlying counties? It's apples and oranges. Yes, the counties are able to be more subtle about handling problems. But statistically, there is no doubt about the crime rate in the school population -- the city's incidence of crime is higher.
\
I'd like to tell Mr. Hall to take off his rose-colored glasses and to wake up and smell the coffee. It couldn't be the parents; they're just victims of society, right? The city schools are crime-ridden and things need to be done to protect the innocent students and personnel. Patricia J. Tucci Baltimore

New school tests flawed
\
The long-awaited 1991 Maryland School Performance Assessment Program results are out and 70 percent of Maryland students scored at the lowest levels. Last May, third, fifth and eighth grade students throughout Maryland spent eight consecutive days laboring over complex thinking and problem solving questions.
\
Millions of tax dollars have been spent by the state to develop this test. Millions will be spent to train and pay teachers to grade the tests. Millions have been spent by the counties to do staff development to prepare teachers to prepare students for the tests. This spending is in addition to the millions spent on the Maryland Functional Testing Program.
\
There is a major flaw in the Maryland School Performance Assessment Program: Students are not motivated, intrinsically or extrinsically, to do their best on the test . . . because they will never see the results! No parent will ever see their child's test results. No teacher will ever see their students' results. No congratulations can be given to students who do well and no remediation can be provided for students who do poorly.
\
Until this major flaw is eliminated, we can expect low scores from this testing program. Most teachers realize that this testing program is flawed. Why don't the educational bureaucrats realize it?
\
The state superintendent's new testing program reminds me of the fable, ""The Emperor's New Clothes."" How much longer will tax money be wasted on this flawed testing program? Ray Hofmann Baltimore

X-Rays in unschooled hands
\
Recently the House of Delegates, with pressure from the Medical-Chirurgical Society, passed House Bill 1339 which gives anyone the right to perform X-rays, in a physician's office, after receiving only 20 hours of training.
\
The argument is that these people will only be X-raying body parts that are not of much concern relative to radiation effects: chest, pelvis, spines, extremities.
\
Unfortunately, most of us believe that our physician knows what is best for us and the fact that his X-ray person is only lightly trained is never discussed. We blindly go where we are directed -- the physician makes the money from our X-ray and we really do not know whether the quality of the X-ray is such that he can determine what is wrong or not wrong.
\
What is really interesting about H.B. 1339 is that these untrained individuals will not be required to meet standards in education that have been legislated by the state for radiologic technologists, who have two years of formal, technical training in radiology. Radiologic technologists also perform X-rays of chests, pelvis, spines, extremities etc., which make up the bulk of the work performed by these professionals.
\
What are our legislators thinking when they require fully trained individuals performing these procedures to maintain continuing education in radiation safety and radiologic practices and do not require anything for those individuals who have less than three days of training?
\
I think it is time for the public to wake up and realize that our health and safety is in jeopardy. We need to tell the physicians who insist on having untrained help so they can increase their profit margin that we are not going to accept this type of care. Susan J. Warwick Hebron

185,"With gas prices so high, consumers are likely to react favorably to just about any plan that might bring them down. But the latest proposal - to create a summer-long ""tax holiday"" and offered by Sen. John McCain - is such a spectacularly bad idea that it's hard to believe it's getting serious consideration. Temporarily suspending the federal gas tax could not only harm the nation's transportation infrastructure but also further drive up prices, an outcome that would enrich oil companies without offering a dime's worth of discount to drivers.\The Republican presidential hopeful raised the tax holiday idea last week in an economic policy speech in Pennsylvania. But Democrats have driven down this route, too. Two years ago, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez were pushing for a 60-day gas tax holiday. A few states are pondering local gas tax holidays.\What would happen if the federal government suspended the 18.4 cents-per-gallon tax? At best, it would put very little in the pockets of average citizens. One study estimates about $28 per family.\But that doesn't factor in market forces. When Florida temporarily dropped its fuel tax by 8 cents four years ago, consumers were so eager to take advantage they lined up at the pump. Shortages ensued. Prices did what prices will do in such an environment - they rose.\But wait, it gets worse. Summer is when states need gas tax revenue the most for road and public transportation projects. The federal Highway Trust Fund is financed chiefly by the fuel tax and is already facing serious financial problems. The fund needs more revenue, not less, just to keep up with basic needs.\It's one thing to offer an income tax refund as an economic stimulus; it's quite another to encourage gasoline consumption. As a nation, we need to conserve fuel and foster alternatives such as traveling by train. Had Mr. McCain and others in Washington shown the foresight to keep the gas tax rate on par with inflation, the country would be much further along in weaning itself off foreign oil - and have a far-better transportation system to boot."

Enjoying those low, low gas prices?
\
They're going up today.
\
The state gasoline tax is slated to increase by about 3 cents thanks to a 2013 change in state law that tied the tax to the consumer price index and the average retail price of gas.
\
The increase is one of a handful of changes in state laws and regulation taking effect today, including an increase in the minimum wage and expansion of a law regulating lead paint in rental properties.
\
With the average price per gallon in Maryland almost 80 cents less than a year ago, a three-penny increase isn't likely to attract much attention, said Ragina Cooper Averella, a spokeswoman for AAA Mid-Atlantic.
\
""Because Maryland motorists have been enjoying gas prices declining over the past couple of months, the impact of the gas tax won't be as noticeable to most motorists, unless for some reason gas prices begin to tick upward, which is not anticipated,"" Averella said.
\
Most Maryland laws take effect July 1 or Oct. 1, but this year two important changes will happen today.
\
The minimum wage will go up to $8 per hour, one of Gov. Martin O'Malley's legislative centerpieces this year.
\
The increase will be followed by a bump to $8.25 on July 1, the continue to rise over the next three years to $10.10 in 2018.
\
The statewide average is $2.55 a gallon. If that holds until Jan. 1, the tax increase would boost the average price to $2.58 a gallon. A year ago Maryland's average price per gallon was $3.38.
\
The increase is tied to a shift in the Sales and Use Tax Equivalent Rate from 1 percent to 2 percent. This portion of the gas tax will be calculated by multiplying the average retail price by the new 2 percent rate.
\
That rate will increase to 3 percent on July 1, 4 percent on Jan. 1, 2016, and 5 percent on July 1, 2016.
\
Since the act's implementation in 2013, Maryland's gas tax has increased from 23.5 cents a gallon to 30.3 cents, according to the state Comptroller's Office. The tax had been at 23.5 cents since 1992.
\
The Maryland Department of Transportation says it's putting the $4.4 billion generated by the increases to good use.
\
An estimated $30 million of the new revenue will go to plan more lanes on the Severn River Bridge, as well as for building a new interchange at Route 175 and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway near Fort George G. Meade, according to the six-year transportation capital budget report.
\
The county also benefits directly from the gas tax through Highway User Funds distributed to local jurisdictions.
\
The new year also will bring an expansion of the state's lead exposure prevention program to homes built between 1950 and 1978.
\
The regulations, primarily aimed at protecting children from lead exposure, require all landlords to register their properties with the Maryland Department of the Environment if built before 1978, the year lead paint was outlawed nationally. Previously, the law required landlords to have registered properties built before 1950.

\
- Federal government, 27 percent - Individual income taxes, 22 percent - Corporate income taxes, 3 percent - Sales tax, 12 percent - Higher education revenues, 11 percent - Transportation revenues, 6 percent - Other general funds, 5 percent - Lottery, 2 percent - Fuel tax, 2 percent - Other special funds, 11 percent
\
Gov. Martin O'Malley's $37.3 billion proposed 2014 budget raises college tuition, gives raises for state workers and provides billions for school and infrastructure upgrades.
\
O'Malley released his spending plan for next year on Wednesday. It requests about 4 percent more than his 2013 request of $35.8 billion.
\
Missing from the governor's plan is an increase in the gasoline tax, a much-talked-about proposal O'Malley has supported in the past for funding transportation projects. That tax increase could be included in the transportation budget, which is being developed.
\
Of the total budget, 47 cents of every dollar goes for education, 25 for health, 11 for public safety and 17 for all other expenditures, including the Departments of Agriculture, Environment, Natural Resources, and Labor, Licensing and Regulation, O'Malley said.
\
Under the new budget, state college tuition will go up 3 percent, one of the lowest increases in the country.
\
The budget also includes about $25 million for school safety programs and equipment, and $25 million to help add air conditioning to schools.
\
""He has addressed a lot of needs,"" said House Speaker Michael E. Busch, D-Annapolis.
\
While the budget does not increase the number of state employees, it does provide for a 3 percent cost-of-living increase, and there are to be no furlough days.
\
About one-tenth of the budget, or $3.7 billion, would go to fund roads, bridges, schools, housing and other capital projects. This spending will create 43,000 new private-sector jobs, O'Malley said.
\
""This budget is a jobs budget,"" the governor said.
\
Critics, such as Senate Minority Leader E.J. Pipkin, R-Cecil, said the job claim is an exaggeration.
\
""Last year, we spent the same amount of money (on construction projects), so how can you say that these are new jobs?"" Pipkin said. ""Where are the jobs? This is a marketing ploy.""
\
O'Malley and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., D-Calvert, are discussing transportation funding proposals. O'Malley attributed the uncertainty surrounding federal funds to the ""hara-kiri Congress down the street"" that seems intent on killing itself -- and the country -- over ideological differences.
\
The governor said that even with the uncertainty that has arisen because Congress and the White House can't agree on spending cuts, the state will be sound.
\
The proposed state budget would build up the Rainy Day Fund and cash reserves to a total of more than $1 billion, O'Malley said. The budget increases the Rainy Day Fund from 5 percent to 6 percent of the total state operating budget.
\
Pipkin said this stockpiling of money is a bad idea.
\
""Maybe we are overtaxing people today for a contingency fund that continues to grow,"" Pipkin said.
\
Curing structural deficit
\
O'Malley said his administration has overcome the $1.7 billion structural deficit he inherited six years ago.
\
The problem arose, O'Malley said, because in 1997 the state cut income taxes by $1 billion each year, while the Thornton plan of 2002 caused education spending to exceed the state's budget by $1.5 billion.
\
Between 2002 and 2006, the General Assembly took what O'Malley called ""insufficient action"" to rectify the problem. Then, in 2007, a deep and stubborn recession hit.
\
The state survived through a series of tax increases, spending cuts and fund transfers, such as taking money out of the Transportation Trust Fund. Then, O'Malley increased taxes and fees enough to cut the revenue shortfall to about $400 million, nearly all of which will be erased this year.
\
Frustration with process
\
Del. Ron George, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over revenues, was studying the budget books late Wednesday.
\
George, R-Annapolis, said he was frustrated, because the most the General Assembly can do is cut spending, and it is prohibited by the state constitution from moving funding from one line item to another.
\
If he could, George said, he would like to move some funds and create more tax credits, to promote business.
\
""I am allowed only to cut, and I cannot take revenue from one place to another. It ties my hands as a legislator. I have umpteen ideas ... but as a legislator, you can't do that.""
\
Buried inside the five voluminous budget books are numerous specifics, such as $65 million in various tax credits, many aimed at promoting business and industry.
\
Also, the budget contains a $25 million tax credit for the movie industry to film here, a 17.5 percent increase over the existing credit.
\
George questioned an O'Malley claim that his administration has cut spending $8 billion over the past six years.
\
""It is an insult when he says that,"" said George, who said the cuts were fictional.
\
O'Malley makes this claim, George said, because the administration spent $8 billion less than it wanted to spend. Or, put another way, it didn't increase the budget as much as it would have liked.
\
""When this governor came into office, the state budget was $27 billion a year and now it is well over $37 billion,"" George said.

"
188,"Opponents of the effort to raise Maryland's gas tax have thrown around a lot of ridiculous claims in recent weeks, from the argument that the money isn't really needed (if anything, the projected $600 million-a-year return is not enough to meet Maryland's future transportation needs) to hand-wringing over local transportation aid that was diverted toward balancing the state budget during the depths of the recession -- as if using the money to spare cuts to schools or avoid tax increases wasn't preferable to pot hole repairs.\Oh, and here's a favorite. Raising the gas tax in a manner that will result in more revenue to the state as prices rise puts the tax, as Del. Herbert McMillan claims, on ""autopilot and locks us out of the cockpit."" (Heavens, imagine a tax that rose with inflation. Let's see, sales, personal income, corporate income, property, transfer ... ). \But the latest criticism smacks of something worse than the customary short-sighted single-mindedness of anti-tax crusaders. Some opponents say not a penny of gas tax money should be spent on public transportation, which should instead be self-sustaining. \What makes this claim particularly laughable is that gas tax opponents insist they want to look out for low-income families. They argue that working people end up paying a higher percentage of their income toward gasoline taxes than high-earners -- and that's true, although the same could surely be said of the sales tax and many other consumption-related taxes and fees. \But what about those who can't afford a car at all? For mass transit to be self-sustaining, fares would have to be astronomical. Would a 400-to-500 percent increase be enough? Considering the immediate drop-off in ridership it would cause, probably not. \Do we really want to make it more difficult for poor people to hold jobs? That's not the only purpose of public transit, of course, but it's certainly among its most vital functions. Without buses, light rail and subway to connect low-income workers with employment, particularly in the Baltimore-Washington corridor, poverty and government-dependence would spike. Putting more people on the dole isn't usually the goal of anti-tax crusaders. \But really, it's worse than that. To suggest that spending on public transit is inherently wasteful is not only unfair but inaccurate. Maryland traffic congestion is already ranked among the worst in the nation. How much worse would it be if not for transit? A full bus may take 60 cars off the road, a full rail car 200. \Public transit provides rides for hundreds of thousands of commuters each day. Without that option, the state would have to be build hundreds more miles of roads to accommodate the traffic -- adding as much as 71 percent more lane miles in some areas, according to one 1999 report on Maryland's transit potential. \In a small state where adding, or even widening, roads may cause serious disruption, displace homeowners and cost billions of dollars, paving one's way out of traffic congestion isn't always a desirable option. That transit is more fuel efficient, produces less greenhouse gases and is better for the environment ought to factor in that decision, too. \It's no shock that much of the opposition to the higher gas tax -- and on spending that money on public transit projects like Baltimore's Red Line -- comes from the rural parts of the state where transit plays a much smaller role. One would hope such lawmakers would see the benefit in keeping the state's urban and suburban centers economically viable, but that doesn't seem to factor into their thinking. \Of course, Maryland could keep separate pots of money for transportation to make sure taxpayers got a one-to-one benefit for what they paid in. But that's a kind of accounting that would hurt rural counties most. How could you justify some expensive bridge or bypass in a sparsely populated Eastern Shore county when most of the gas tax revenue comes from Central Maryland? \We'd be the first to admit that raising the gas tax isn't a cure-all for financing the state's long-term transportation infrastructure demands, particularly as vehicles continue to become more fuel efficient and consumption of gasoline slows and perhaps even drops. But for now, raising the gas tax from its 21-year-old rate -- as the House of Delegates agreed to do last week and a majority of the Senate is likely to do soon -- is a reasonable step toward meeting Maryland's most pressing transportation needs in the near-term, including its vital transit lines.\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
189,"Staff Writer\SALISBURY -- With a Congressional seat that spans the heart of the Chesapeake Bay up for grabs, candidates Andy Harris and Frank Kratovil both say environmental concerns are a top priority in the 1st District.\Kratovil, a Democrat, is a Queen Anne's County state's attorney with no voting record, while Harris, a Republican, is a three-term state senator in Baltimore and Harford counties who has voted against laws that regulate greenhouse gases and renewable energy on account that they drive up costs.\When gas prices peaked at $4 per gallon this summer, both candidates unveiled energy plans aimed at helping wary consumers. Harris pushed for offshore drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf and a temporary suspension of Maryland's 42-cent gas tax. Kratovil, meanwhile, said government should close regulatory loopholes for oil companies and invest in tax credits for hybrid vehicles.\Creston Long, co-director of Salisbury University's Institute for Public Affairs and Civic Engagement, said while the environment may not be a deciding issue among all voters, it can make a difference in a close race.\""Within a faction it could be deciding,"" Long said.\This week four environmental groups -- Clean Water Action, Environment Maryland, the Maryland League of Conservation Voters and the Maryland Sierra -- came together in Baltimore to criticize Harris for -- in their view -- siding with industry over the environment.\Kratovil, who despite never casting a vote, carries high environmental accolade among groups such as LCV, which expect him to carry on a legacy by outgoing incumbent Rep. Wayne T. Gilchrest.\Gilchrest, who was defeated in the primary by Harris and then on Sept. 2 endorsed Kratovil, chaired a Congressional caucus of the six states in the Bay watershed. The states are Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.\""Very careful consideration should be given to the ramifications of further polluting and degrading and overdeveloping the Delmarva peninsula,"" Gilchrest said. ""It wouldn't take much for agriculture, tourism and the fisheries to disappear without policies in place.""\LCV, which has ranked public officials for more than 30 years, gives Harris the fourth worst voting record out of 188 members of the General Assembly, said Ryan Ewing, an Eastern Shore field officer in Easton.\""It's not that Harris votes against things. He often leads the charge against clean energy,"" Ewing said.\Harris said he has opposed bills aimed at helping the environment because they put Maryland's businesses at a disadvantage with competing states. In some cases, the technology doesn't exist for the requirements to be effective, he said. Worse, several of these bills will end up increasing costs for consumers who are already struggling with high energy bills, he said.\This perspective explains why he voted against bills to lower emissions in Maryland's automobiles, to require utility companies to cut demand by 15 percent by 2015, to require the Maryland Department of the Environment to reduce statewide greenhouse gases by 25 percent by 2020 and a bill to require that utility companies increase credits for renewable energy to one-fifth their total portfolio by 2022, he said.\""When you pass a mandate, you are placing an energy tax on the consumer,"" Harris said.\Kratovil, however, said he favors government mandates as part of an appropriate mix of a short-term and long-term approach.\The investments that are made today in alternative energies, such as wind, solar and fuel cell technology, will stimulate more progress and ultimately pay great dividends, Kratovil said.\""We need oversight, we need incentive and also a government which can push the envelope in new technologies,"" Kratovil said.\Judith Stribling, a SU biology professor and president of Friends of the Nanticoke River, said sound environmental policy should use government dollars to develop new technologies.\""Harris opposes all government regulation,"" she said. ""That's what got us where we are today with the housing collapse and Wall Street.""\Stocks on Wall Street have plummeted this week after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch was bought out by Bank of America. The federal government, which the week prior took over mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, also extended an $85 billion loan to AIG and took over executive control of the insurance giant.\Harris said the United States should build dozens of nuclear power plants because it represents clean, efficient energy. Next generation technologies, such as cold fusion and more-advanced solar panels should be the focus, he said.\Kratovil said wind, solar and fuel-efficient technologies exist today that are deserving of investment.\""We must look at the ultimate goal: To lower fossil fuel consumption,"" Harris said. ""But the economy must come first.""\The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a poll of 400 voters conducted Sept. 9 though 12 that showed Kratovil and Harris are tied among uninformed voters at a margin of 36 to 39 percent.\The next fundraising totals will be released by the Federal Election Commission on Oct. 15.\glatshaw@dmg.gannett.com\410-749-7171, ext. 216\The candidates' stance on the issues\1st District debate at SU\Salisbury University is scheduled to hold a debate between the 1st District candidates for U.S. Congress on Sept. 30.\The participants will be Andy Harris (R), Frank Kratovil (D) and Richard Harris, a libertarian candidate.

Police suit
\
In response to your article, ""Anne Arundel County settles police brutality suit"" (The Capital, Dec. 18): I question the motives of our police department because they declined to comment. Why did they decline, what are they hiding?
\
It appears the officer is not being supervised or counseled. After incidents with him, the police department transfers him to another part of the county.
\
These are tough economic times - where did the $200,000 payout come from? Are we self-insured with an endless hidden account to hide the county's eyesores?
\
It is truly a disgrace that citizens will have to foot the bill with our tax dollars for these incidents. Meanwhile, the officer is still on the job, collecting his pay, sworn to protect. Why?
\
Will the police department guarantee this won't happen again? Who will protect us from him?

It's January and the General Assembly is back in town and the first words out of their mouths were: ""Let's raise sales tax and the gas tax!""
\
How is it that every January these folks are allowed to pick the pockets of every John and Jane Q. citizen? We have to live within our means and budget and if we cannot, we scrimp.

So why don't these pickpocketers do the same? Cut their salary and expenses. Why do citizens have to foot the bill for their lodging and feeding? Why not put them up in public housing? After all, it is only for 90 days.

Class warfare
\
When Democrats legitimately protest immense and growing concentrations of wealth in a small percentage of the population, while the middle class sinks and the poor get poorer, they are accused of indulging in class warfare.
\
But the experts at waging class warfare are the Republicans, whose relentless agenda enhances the fortunes of the wealthy, but proposes to reduce government programs essential for the well-being of everybody else.
\
Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, environmental protection, unemployment compensation, and education assistance will be on the chopping block if the Republicans win the 2012 elections. If you don't believe that, you have not been listening or reading what the GOP candidates have been saying.
\
There's no secret in why the average income of the richest 1 percent of the population increased by 275 percent in the past 30 years, while middle income families struggled to maintain a decent standard of living. The rich benefited from a tax and regulatory system and other policies rigged in their favor. The Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 gave a 7 percent increase in after tax income to the wealthiest Americans.
\
Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who wants a fair tax system, famously said on one occasion: ""If this is class warfare, my side is winning.""

Taxes
\
With the federal government proposing cuts to its budget over the next 10 years there are many families in Maryland who now have to worry about another round of job losses in the state. Some estimates place the total losses up around 150,000 Marylanders in worst-case scenarios.
\
Instead of promoting a business-friendly environment and alleviating the tax burden on small businesses and the middle class, it appears Gov. Martin O'Malley and the Democrats have decided to crush us with a large increase in the gas tax and flush tax, as well as spending over $350 million on capital projects, which will employ roughly 11,650 short-term jobs. At around $30,000 per job under O'Malley's plan it would take about $4.5 billion to make up for federal job losses in the next 10 years.
\
It is past time for our officials to realize they cannot tax Marylanders to employ every citizen and instead encourage the private sector to do what it does best: create jobs. One needs only to look to our friends in Virginia to see that a pro-business approach is the best way to create jobs in a state heavily dependent on an expected decrease in federal spending. Unfortunately our current officials are not creating the environment Marylanders need to succeed in.
\
For this legislative session it is imperative that citizens get to work on pressing our elected officials and let them know we are not going to allow them to continue with their failed leadership.
\
By getting involved now, we can make sure that we have representatives in the General Assembly who will protect the values and financial livelihood of Maryland families through business-friendly and private sector encouragement.

"
191,"
The Citizens Campaign for the Environment hosts its annual Legislative Summit later this month. Attendees will learn about environmentalists' top priorities for this year's General Assembly session. Several lawmakers usually attend the event.
\
The event usually is packed, so get there early to ensure a seat.
\
WHAT: Environmental Legislative Summit.
\
WHEN: 4:30 to 6 p.m. on Jan. 29.
\
WHERE: Miller Senate Office Building, 11 Bladen St. in Annapolis.
\
INFO: www.mdlcv.org.
\
While much of the focus for state lawmakers in Annapolis the next three months will be on hot-button issues -- gun control, the death penalty, the gas tax -- environmental issues also will be debated.
\
Environmental advocates had a banner year in 2012, winning victories on limiting new housing developments with septic systems and paying for fixing stormwater pollution.
\
They're hoping to get even more environmentally-friendly bills passed in 2013, including a high-profile bill on windpower.
\
""There's some cautious optimism that things we're looking to do this year for the environment hopefully will get some traction,"" said Erik Michelsen, who leads the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, a coalition of more than two dozen environmental advocacy groups.
\
Meanwhile, there could be push back from people who are not thrilled with new environmental laws, especially from rural counties where the cost is a concern.
\
""There are going to be many attacks on our programs,"" said Alison Prost, Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. ""It's becoming very real for people the changes they'll have to make for their every day lives.""
\
Here's a look at some of the key environmental issues for the 2013 General Assembly session.
\
Windpower
\
Gov. Martin O'Malley is expected to make a big push to promote windpower off of the coast of Ocean City.
\
The bill has stalled in past years, but a change in membership of a state Senate committee could bolster the bill's chances this year.
\
Sen. Anthony Muse of Prince George's County was moved out of the Senate Finance Committee, which votes on the bill. He's being replaced by Sen. Victor Ramirez, also from Prince George's County. Both are Democrats, but Muse has opposed the wind bill in the past.
\
Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. said windpower will be debated by the full Senate this year. It passed the House of Delegates last year.
\
The governor's wind bill likely will require that a certain percentage of electricity sold in Maryland will have to come from windpower.
\
""It creates a niche that would theoretically provide more incentive for firms"" to develop wind projects, said Michelsen, who is executive director of the South River Federation in Edgewater in addition to his duties with the Citizens Campaign for the Environment.
\
Fracking
\
Energy companies have been eyeing the Western Maryland mountains as a place to drill for natural gas using a controversial technique called hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking.""
\
Part of the Marcellus Shale, a gas-rich underground formation, runs through Western Maryland.
\
Environmentalists are concerned that if done improperly, fracking could contaminate groundwater with substances used in the drilling process.
\
O'Malley issued an executive order in 2011 that created a commission to evaluate fracking's potential effects in Maryland, so the industry has been on hold until the commission's work is complete.
\
Michelsen said it's important to put stronger moratorium in place, at least for now.
\
""This would be a more formal way to make sure it doesn't move forward until it's better understood,"" he said.
\
Del. Heather Mizeur, D-Montgomery, said she'll introduce a bill to put an official moratorium in place until adequate studies and risk analyses are done.
\
""We have more questions than answers that continue to trouble us in Maryland,"" Mizeur said during a press conference earlier this week.
\
Drew Cobbs, executive director of the Maryland Petroleum Council, said it's premature to take any action on fracking. He said it's best to wait until the governor's fracking group makes its recommendations in 2014.
\
""The process is ongoing,"" he said. ""Obviously, certain people just want the answer 'No' under any conditions. But it's premature to do anything until the commission finishes their work.""
\
Anti-fracking activists hit the ground running, holding a demonstration on the first day of the General Assembly session featuring murky-looking well water contaminated by fracking in Pennsylvania.
\
Chesapeake Bay
\
Advocates for the Chesapeake Bay aren't pushing many major bills; rather, they expect to play lots of defense this session.
\
""We are very cognizant of the wins we got last session. We want to defend them,"" said Prost from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
\
In 2012, state lawmakers required local governments to institute some form of a stormwater tax and also set out new guidelines for limiting the use of septic systems in new housing developments.
\
Both have proven unpopular, especially in rural counties, and could be undone through legislation.
\
Chesapeake Bay advocates also will work to protect funding sources for the bay, including the Chesapeake Bay 2010 Trust Fund, which pays for on-the-ground projects.
\
Del. Cathy Vitale, R-Severna Park, has a bill that would make sure that the Maryland Clean Water Fund -- which gets money from fines and permit fees -- would be used more for on-the-ground projects and less for administrative purposes. The Capital reported last year that the majority of the Maryland Clean Water Fund pays for salaries at the Maryland Department of the Environment.
\
Sen. Bryan Simonaire, R-Pasadena, plans to sponsor a bill to increase fines for sewage spills.
\
Bags and bottles
\
Two perennial trash-related issues will get yet another airing in Annapolis this year.
\
One measure would add a fee -- probably a few pennies -- onto each disposable bag distributed by stores. Some of the money would go to environmental programs and some would be kept by the retailers.
\
Another bill would put a deposit on plastic bottles, with the money returned to customers when they take the bottles in for recycling. Bottle deposits are in place in several other states.
\
The goal of both bills is to reduce the amount of trash and litter.
\
""Things like bags and bottles are representative of stormwater runoff,"" said Prost of the bay foundation. ""For every bottle or bag you see, there's sediment, phosphorus, oil that comes with it also.""
\
Pesticides
\
The Pesticide Information Act would require people who sell or apply pesticides to report certain information to the state.
\
The idea is to make sure the state has information on hand if it needs to investigate health, safety or environmental issues that might involve pesticides.

"
192,"Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and county government leaders say they will press the General Assembly to restore hundreds of millions of dollars a year in funding for local transportation projects. But state lawmakers say that's going to be a tough sell.\The legislature began siphoning money collected from the gas tax and motor vehicle fees to balance the state budget in the aftermath of the recession. Lawmakers declined to reverse the change as part of last session's debate on Maryland's long-term transportation plan. \In the past several years, Rawlings-Blake said, the city missed out on $440 million for road maintenance and construction as Annapolis kept a larger share of the transportation revenue. \""When you ... get frustrated at the pace of road improvement, you have to take that into consideration, that our funding level has been reduced,"" she said. ""That has an impact."" \For decades, local governments got roughly 30 percent of the money raised from the gas tax and vehicle registration fees, together called ""highway user revenue."" But the proportion was cut to less than 10 percent in 2010. \The General Assembly's decision to alter the funding distribution was one of the primary structural budget adjustments made in response to the recession. Many state lawmakers see undoing the decision as economically unfeasible. The legislature begins its annual 90-day session Jan. 8. \Sen. James E. ""Ed"" DeGrange Sr., an Anne Arundel Democrat who chairs a key Senate budget subcommittee, said it is unlikely that the state will send extra cash to the fund that gives local jurisdictions money for roads. \""I doubt that locals are going to get that restored this year,"" DeGrange said, though he said the gas tax increase will help pay for large projects -- such as the Dover Bridge over the Choptank River between Talbot and Caroline counties -- that have been on the back burner for years. \His comments echoed those of other leaders who were quizzed about highway money at a recent Maryland Association of Counties meeting in Cambridge. \Gov. Martin O'Malley drew applause when he used the phrase ""highway user revenue"" in a speech, but he offered no specific plan to return money to local governments. Asked about the issue the next day, O'Malley's chief legislative officer, Jeanne Hitchcock, told county officials, ""We value your partnership, and we're doing the best that we can."" \In 2007, Baltimore and the counties divided more than $500 million in highway user revenue, but the local share dropped to $167.5 million in the current fiscal year. The state is expected to bring in $1.75 billion in such revenue this year. \The loss of funding was nearly $100 million for Baltimore, which is responsible for maintaining all roads within its borders except Interstates 95 and 895. The state sent the city nearly $227 million in 2007, compared with $134 million in the current budget. \Meanwhile, Anne Arundel County's share dropped from $32 million to $3 million and Baltimore County went from $43 million to less than $4 million. Carroll County's share dropped from $14.5 million to $1.5 million, Harford County's from $16.6 million to $1.7 million and Howard County's from $15.9 million to $1.5 million. \Michael Sanderson, director of the Maryland Association of Counties, said pushing for restoration of the money is the group's top legislative initiative. While the gas tax legislation will provide an infusion of cash for road projects statewide, the Assembly did not permanently restore the share going toward local governments. \Historically, the state kept 70 percent of highway user revenue and sent 30 percent to be divided among local governments based on road mileage and vehicle registrations. But amid a budget crisis, the legislature in 2010 decided to change the formula, keeping 71.5 percent for the Transportation Department, 19.3 percent for the general fund, 7.5 percent for Baltimore and 1.7 percent for the counties. \Sanderson contends that as new money starts coming in as part of the increased gas tax, the legislature should return a greater share to local governments. The tax on gasoline will increase in stages through mid-2016, and the first 3.5-cent increase took effect last summer. \""Now is the time to come up with a plan,"" he said. Local governments ""are still sitting on the starvation budget."" \The consequences for local governments have been severe, Sanderson said. \""We're down to 5 or 10 cents on the dollar,"" he said. ""Local governments just don't have funds for anything but bare-bones maintenance and emergency patching. We're seeing counties saying, 'We can't make this investment in public safety or parks or the environment because we have to take money to patch potholes.' "" \In Baltimore, the loss of highway user funds was one of the biggest hits to the city's budget in recent years, according to the mayor's office. The city dealt with that loss and others by reducing capital spending, laying off or furloughing staff, freezing pay, closing fire companies and reducing library hours and the swimming pool season. \Rawlings-Blake said she hopes to make a case to lawmakers about investing more in Baltimore's roads and bridges. \""There are so many other infrastructure needs that we have, we can't continue to take the hit on highway user revenue,"" she said. ""Maintaining every lane mile, plowing every inch of snow, that's our responsibility."" \Baltimore Sun reporter Erin Cox contributed to this article. \ywenger@baltsun.com \twitter.com/yvonnewenger\Credit: The Baltimore Sun"

License law
\
I feel compelled to write this letter in regards to the recent actions taken by the County Council and their lack of interest of the concerns of county residents and businesses. I recently received a letter from the county informing me of a law that was passed by the council and put into law Oct. 1 of this year.
\
The law concerns the additional licensing needed by businesses buying secondhand precious metals. It appears that we now need a county license of $350 plus an additional $50 per employee. This is on top of the state license that we already have to do the same thing.
\
It also adds an additional 11 days to the holding period to make it 30 days. The state requires 19 days. In these turbulent times and the cost of doing business, the constant fluctuation of the metal market makes it even harder to give the best prices to our clients.
\
As far as I know, people within this field were not notified that there was even going to be a hearing or testimony. This is just what the council has been doing on everything coming across in recent months. Small business is still being slammed with additional taxes and fees from both the state and county. Duplication of licenses and fees is ridiculous and needs to come to an end.
\
If small business is the backbone of America, then why are the state and county trying make us go away? How much more can we take? I think it is important to let the public know it is not just their pocket that the state and county has their hand in.

Red Cross
\
Like John Milleker, I, too, had been a faithful blood donor to the Red Cross until one day I read a news article stating another fine being levied against them for ""sloppy blood screenings"" (Maryland Gazette, Jan. 4). So, I thought I'd do a little research and found out that these fines have been ongoing since 2001.
\
Every so often, the government levies a fine against the Red Cross, so far amounting to $37 million. I also found that the current CEO pulls down a salary of over $1 million per year. That prompted a question in my mind, ""Where in the heck does a nonprofit organization get that kind of money?""
\
From selling my blood, that's where! So looking at this a different way, I see my blood donations as nothing more than another way for the government to get more money out of me. When being fined goes from occurring once or twice to becoming an annual event, then it passes from being an anomaly to being a tax.
\
Why is it that I can't give my blood in a manner which ensures someone isn't making a profit from it?

With the federal government proposing cuts to its budget over the next 10 years there are many families in Maryland who now have to worry about another round of job losses in the state. Some estimates place the total losses up around 150,000 Marylanders in worst-case scenarios.
\
Instead of promoting a business-friendly environment and alleviating the tax burden on small businesses and the middle class, it appears Gov. Martin O'Malley and the Democrats have decided to crush us with a large increase in the gas tax and flush tax, as well as spending over $350 million on capital projects, which will employ roughly 11,650 short-term jobs. At around $30,000 per job under O'Malley's plan it would take about $4.5 billion to make up for federal job losses in the next 10 years.
\
It is past time for our officials to realize they cannot tax Marylanders to employ every citizen and instead encourage the private sector to do what it does best: create jobs. One needs only to look to our friends in Virginia to see that a pro-business approach is the best way to create jobs in a state heavily dependent on an expected decrease in federal spending. Unfortunately our current officials are not creating the environment Marylanders need to succeed in.
\
For this legislative session it is imperative that citizens get to work on pressing our elected officials and let them know we are not going to allow them to continue with their failed leadership.
\
By getting involved now, we can make sure that we have representatives in the General Assembly who will protect the values and financial livelihood of Maryland families through business-friendly and private sector encouragement.

194,"
Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. is expected to present a $22 billion budget tomorrow proposing new fees on marinas and vehicle registration, while scaling back increases in education funding and cutting 2,000 vacant state jobs, state officials and sources said.
\
Mr. Ehrlich's second budget since he assumed office last year will attempt to fill a $700 million shortfall without raising taxes.
\
County lawmakers yesterday expressed great concern with the $50 per-boat slip fee for marinas, which they said would be passed on to the thousands of boat owners registered in the county.
\
They said they were also worried about possible cuts to local governments and state grants.
\
Kendl P. Philbrick, acting state secretary of the environment, confirmed that his department is asking lawmakers to approve the fee. He said it would be up to the marinas whether to pay the fee or pass it along to boaters. Sources said the budget also does not impose a gas tax.
\
Yesterday, Scott Croft, a spokesman for the national boater's coalition BoatUS, called the fee ""unfair.""
\
While Maryland boaters pay about 1 percent of all the fuel tax the state takes in, just 0.3 percent of that money is spent on boating related services, such as water-based emergency response, education and public ramps and docks.
\
""Boaters in Maryland already are paying more than their fair share,"" Mr. Croft said. ""We'd like to see the money that's already being paid in gas taxes by boaters be used toward more boating safety.""
\
While the exact number of marinas in Anne Arundel County was not available this morning, there are thousands of boat slips along its hundreds of miles of shoreline and around Kent Island in Queen Anne's County. There are 600 marinas statewide.
\
In Annapolis alone, there are over 200 businesses tied to the recreational boating industry. There were 36,992 boats registered to county residents in 2003, according to the Department of Natural Resources.
\
The economic impact of boating is immense, with roughly $2 billion a year spent statewide, according to the Maryland Sea Grant program. Some $200 million a year is spent in Anne Arundel County alone.
\
Some lawmakers said it did not make much sense for a governor who has vociferously opposed taxes to now call for a fee on marinas.
\
""A tax and a fee - same difference. They are both three-letter words,"" said Sen. Ed DeGrange, D-Glen Burnie and a member of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee.
\
Mr. DeGrange said when he served on the County Council in the early and mid-'90s, it voted to reduce the slip tax because frustrated boat owners were moving their boats to the Eastern Shore to avoid the tax.
\
He said fixes such as this, and the proposed $60 automobile registration fee, were temporary ones.
\
""I don't see any of those things fixing the structural deficit,"" he said.
\
Del. Virginia Clagett, D-West River, said the governor appears to be supporting user fees, but pointed out that the sales tax is also a user fee.
\
Mr. Ehrlich has opposed a sales tax increase. House Speaker Michael E. Busch, D-Annapolis, has said a penny increase would shrink the budget gap significantly.
\
The automobile registration fee is drawing fire from Mr. Busch who called it a ""totally regressive"" tax that would unfairly burden senior citizens who hardly use their cars.
\
""When Gov. Ehrlich introduces it I intend to fight it,"" he said.
\
Republican lawmakers reacted cautiously to news of the proposed fees, but said they would wait to hear from the governor tomorrow. They said they were pleased with the budget overall, adding the governor would also restore some funding to the Transportation Trust Fund, which he raided last year to make up for a budget deficit.
\
Del. John Leopold, R-Pasadena, said he has never supported any tax increases but would not say whether he would support the proposed fees.
\
""I would like to hear from my constituents on the marina fee,"" he said.
\
Sen Janet Greenip, R-Crofton, said she was particularly happy with a proposal that cuts 2,000 vacant state jobs.
\
""The state is tightening its belt quite a bit,"" she said.
\
Although Mr. Ehrlich will propose an increase in state funding for education, he has opted to fund $45 million less than the full $1.3 billion called for in legislation that adopted the recommendations of the Thornton Commission.
\
The assembly provided a trap door option if the money wasn't available. Lawmakers are required to vote by the first week in March for the full plan or adopt ""Thornton Lite.""
\
Mrs. Greenip said the increase in spending was still positive.
\
""This is the biggest increase in public education funding in Maryland's history,"" she said.
\
Del. Mary Ann Love, D-Glen Burnie, said she was worried about cuts to local governments.
\
""If we collect taxes we feel that whatever is due to the county should be given to them. Anne Arundel County has a difficult time because it is growing so fast,"" she said.
\
Meanwhile, Mr. Philbrick said the Maryland Department of Environment also would like to charge developers who build in wetlands areas a fee, which would be set by a regulatory committee.
\
Money generated by the fees would be used for MDE ""wetlands and waterways"" programs, he said.
\
The governor has also proposed a surcharge of $2.50 a month on residents' sewage bills that is expected to raise $66 million a year to modernize the state's largest wastewater plants.

195," Matthews opposes tax\ ANNAPOLIS\ ANNAPOLIS -- Del. Richard C. Matthews, R-Carroll, referring to the proposed 5-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase, said: ""Those who want it are calling it a `jobs bill' -- a bill to give local government back some of its lost state aid -- and `a jumpstart for the state's lagging economy.' Indeed, they're calling it everything but what it is -- a tax increase that will make Maryland's gas tax the fourth-highest in the nation.""\ The new gas tax would be 23.5 cents a gallon. Only Connecticut and Rhode Island at 26 cents and Nebraska at 23.8 cents per gallon are higher.\ Matthews said that no matter what they call it, he's against the proposed increase.\ ""I'm against it in whatever form it comes: a flat 5 cents-per-gallon increase or the sales tax on the pump price, which would increase gas tax revenues automatically as the pump price rose and which would constitute a tax on a tax because existing federal and state gas taxes are included in the pump price.""\ He noted that with Delaware's gas tax at 19 cents a gallon and gas taxes in the District of Columbia, Virginia and Pennsylvania at 18 cents, 17.7 cents and 12 cents respectively, ""it's a safe bet that many a Marylander living close to the state's borders will drive across the state line to get their gas in Pennsylvania, where gas is already 6 cents a gallon cheaper.""\ Matthews said county executives from Baltimore, Montgomery, Anne Arundel and Prince George's counties have lined up to support the bill as a way to offset some part of the nearly $200 million in cuts to state aid. It is likely that some portion of the gas tax revenues will be distributed to the counties to help them pay for services.\ Many businesses, especially those concerned with construction, have voiced support of the tax.\ ""Only the people oppose the tax hike,"" Matthews said. ""Four out of five AAA members oppose the tax. I have been overwhelmed with calls from people who oppose the gas tax hike.""\ The 5-cent increase would raise $625 million over the next five years and enable the state to claim $1.1 billion in federal transportation money. However, without it, the Schaefer administration could proceed with highway projects because federal law permits the states to defer payment of their 20 percent share for up to two years.\ Boundaries adopted\ ANNAPOLIS\ ANNAPOLIS -- Carroll will have an entire legislative district contained within its borders for the first time since the 1960s, under a redistricting plan adopted by the General Assembly Friday.\ Carroll legislators praised the plan, saying it gives the county more influence in the legislature. The last two redistrictings -- a process in which political boundaries are redrawn every 10 years to reflect population shifts -- left Carroll fragmented.\ ""I'm very happy, particularly when you have counties like Baltimore and Howard split into many districts,"" said Del. Richard N. Dixon, D-Carroll. ""We're in an extremely favorable position. It's a big win for us.""\ The plan introduced by the governor became law automatically because no alternate plan was enacted or changes approved by the 45th day of the session. Legislators expect the plan will be challenged in court by Baltimore County lawmakers, who are unhappy about sharing a number of districts with Baltimore.\ The new boundaries will take effect in the 1994 state election, barring legal action. Three delegates and one senator represent each of the state's 47 legislative districts, which have an ideal population of about 102,000.\ District 5, with a population of 99,034, will consist of eastern and central Carroll.\ District 5 currently includes a portion of western Baltimore County, which means Republican Sen. Larry E. Haines must divide his attention between the two counties.\ The two subdistricts now constituting District 5 will be combined. Dixon and Del. Richard C. Matthews, R-Carroll, now represent District 5A, the lion's share of the county. The third delegate, Democrat Lawrence A. LaMotte, mostly represents Baltimore County residents in District 5B. LaMotte, who lives in Baltimore County, also represents two precincts in the Eldersburg area.\ Under the plan, one senator and one delegate will represent 24,000 residents in western Carroll, part of District 4. The senator also will represent about 75,000 constituents in Frederick County.\ Sen. Charles H. Smelser, D-Carroll, Frederick, Howard, currently represents District 4. Republican Del. Donald B. Elliott represents western Carroll and Howard in a subdistrict.\ The subdistrict under the new plan includes 24,338 Carroll residents and 10,809 Frederick residents.\ Howard County will be dropped from District 4. The Myers election district, which includes Silver Run and Union Mills, will be switched from District 4 to District 5.\ Carroll legislators have argued since last summer that the county should be kept intact with western Maryland districts, rather than fragmented among Baltimore-area jurisdictions.\ Provide care for poor\ ANNAPOLIS\ ANNAPOLIS -- Del. Lawrence A. LaMotte, D-Carroll, Baltimore, has introduced a bill that would require most nursing homes to dedicate one-third of their bed capacities to medical assistance program recipients.\ Under the proposal, nursing homes providing comprehensive or extended care would have to meet that requirement as a condition of receiving a license or license renewal. Certain nursing homes could gain exemptions.\ LaMotte is one of a small group of delegates, including the Speaker of the House, working on structural changes in the way the state operates and finances medical assistance programs. These programs have been cut in the last two years and face more reductions next year.\ STATUS OF CARROLL COUNTY'S LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE\ Bill HB 446 Description of proposed legislation Authorize county to borrow money to lend up to $2 million to 14 volunteer fire companies for capital improvements Status (as of Friday) Pending March 3 hearing, House Appropriations Committee Bill HB 1013 Description of proposed legislation Authorize county to borrow $15 million through bond sale for public facility projects Status (as of Friday) Pending March 3 hearing, House Appropriations Committee Bill HB 1014 Description of proposed legislation Enable commissioners to employ detention center inmates for public projects, contributing to rehabilitation Status (as of Friday) Pending Feb. 28 hearing, House Judiciary Committee Bill HB 1015 Description of proposed legislation Authorize municipalities to grant payment deferral of property tax increases to certain elderly and disabled persons (submitted by Westminster Mayor W.

We didn't think it made any sense last spring when the General Assembly - specifically, the state Senate under President Mike Miller - smothered a ""green fund"" bill.
\
Mr. Miller frankly said that some such bill would have to be passed within four years to raise money to realize the state's environmental goals, cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay chief among them. So, what was the benefit of a delay? None, as far as the environment was concerned. But Mr. Miller didn't want to see any revenue-gathering that would bypass the general fund (and, presumably, a massive revenue-raising package including slot machines).
\
Green fund advocates are back this fall, arguing that as long as Marylanders are likely to be subjected to higher sales and tobacco taxes, the environment deserves to be part of the revenue-raising picture.
\
They are right when they say that the state needs money to meet its cleanup goals. But the political terrain has gotten rougher. The environmentalists are going to have a tough time selling Marylanders - or at least their representatives in the General Assembly - on an additional fee in a year in which taxes are almost certain to go up.
\
The new proposal, as discussed at a press conference at St. John's College this week, is more modest than last session's, but would affect more Marylanders. The previous bill would have put a tax on newly built impervious surfaces. This time a fee of 1 cent for every square foot would be imposed on existing impervious surfaces on commercial, industrial and residential buildings. Also, homes would be assessed at 1 cent for every square foot of living space beyond 1,000 square feet. So, for instance, the owner of a 2,000-square-foot-home would pay $10 a year.
\
This new, more inclusive approach earned the proposal the support of the Home Builders Association of Maryland, a strident critic last time out. But it may make the idea less popular.
\
About $85 million would be raised, half going to improving stormwater controls, 40 percent to paying farmers to change practices that send runoff and nutrient pollution into the bay, and 10 percent to restoring oysters, wetlands and forests.
\
Every penny could be put to good use.
\
Marylanders are more likely to agree to higher taxes or fees if they can have some confidence that the money will be used for designated purposes with which they agree - such as helping the environment. It's the state's bad habit of raiding the Transportation Trust Fund that makes raising the gas tax such a tough sell.
\
But Marylanders probably won't be in the mood for any additional fees at all this year, when major tax increases are in the offing. It will be up to the environmental organizations and their allies to make the best case they can.
"
197," Maryland lawmakers have roughly three weeks to figure out how to pay for programs and services and make up for a projected shortfall in revenue -- creating concern for business people who fear they will pay bigger bills as a result.\ Representatives of the business community say they believe Maryland has made strides in creating a more friendly corporate environment under Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich, the state's first Republican governor since 1969. Recent studies of the business tax burden relative to other states support that view. But many are waiting to see how state leaders act to close the estimated $800 million budget gap and fund priorities in the next fiscal year which begins July 1.\ Business leaders say they have little concrete in the way of wins or losses from the General Assembly so far this session, which ends April 12, but the most sweeping measures often aren't decided until the final days.\ Kathleen T. Snyder, president and chief executive of the Maryland Chamber of Commerce, warned a group of business people and lobbyists during a meeting with lawmakers last week not to become overly secure just because the governor has publicly opposed sales, income and gas tax increases.\ ""We cannot rely on the governor to veto every bill we think is bad for business,"" she said. ""There are a multitude of bills that could add taxes that would keep businesses from hiring people. It is up to us, and some lawmakers say they are not hearing from businesses in their districts.""\ Some lawmakers of both parties said at the chamber meeting that partisanship has kept the governor from working well in his second year with the Democrat-dominated legislature.\ But others told the chamber that compromises are in the works. House Speaker Michael E. Busch said negotiations are continuing with the governor, whose top business issues include:\ Implementing a surcharge, dubbed the ""flush tax,"" on water and sewer bills to help clean up the Chesapeake Bay.\ Funding transportation projects, partially by charging higher fees to register automobiles or raising the gas tax.\ Closing a loophole in the corporate income tax law that allows companies that create Delaware holding companies to avoid Maryland taxes.\ Expanding gambling in Maryland to allow slot machines.\ Reducing premiums for malpractice coverage for doctors, who say they no longer can afford insurance.\ Sen. Thomas M. ""Mac"" Middleton, a Charles County Democrat and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, added that health care affordability and access also remain pivotal.\ Del. Jean Cryor, a Montgomery County Republican, said proposals for increased taxes on snacks and gasoline, among other bills, are tempting to lawmakers when so many projects are underfunded -- particularly transportation.\ Cryor served on a commission that recommended raising $300 million for transportation projects around the state. To pay for this and other items, ""some taxes will get through and others will not,"" she said.\ For now, tax and regulatory burdens are not unreasonable, and are low compared with those in some states, said Richard Clinch, director of economics for the Maryland Business Research Partnership, a University of Baltimore think tank. And the state weathered the national recession better than many.\ ""No news is good news from the business perspective,"" he said. ""Rarely has the General Assembly taken a look at business and yielded anything positive. ... Now, Maryland is no hell for businesses, which is what people were saying eight years ago.""\ Robert O.C. Worcester, president of Maryland Business for Responsive Government, a pro-business group, went as far as to say inaction would be a good thing for business. He called the number of bills that would increase taxes or fees in some way on businesses ""unprecedented.""\ ""This is how you drive business out of the state,"" Worcester said. ""I'd rather see the government face up to the need to make cuts than look for ways to add revenue.""\ One Republican leader said lawmakers need to keep in mind their local employers during the final weeks of debate.\ ""It would be nice if every member had to run a business for a year, meet payroll taxes, live by all the rules and regulations we pass,"" said Del. George Edwards, the Garrett County Republican who is House minority leader.\ ""I bet a lot of votes would be different.""\ Credit: SUN STAFF"

199,"Highways are often regarded as the ultimate example of user-financed government. Motorists pay a variety of fees, from state and federal taxes on fuel to titling and registration fees on vehicles, to pay for their construction and maintenance. But are roads truly self-sustaining? A new study says absolutely not.\Researcher Mark A. Delucchi of the University of California, Davis' Institute of Transportation Studies recently looked at the nation's total expenditures on roads and compared the result with the total collected in highway-related taxes and fees. The gap was substantial - the tax on a gallon of gas would have to be increased 20 to 70 cents per gallon to make driving a car a truly fee-for-service arrangement.\That's not necessarily to advocate for an immediate doubling or tripling of the gas tax, but policymakers need to reject the long-held myth that driving a car is not a heavily taxpayer-subsidized activity. This is a key point in the ongoing debate over whether to spend money on public transit or roads. Transit may be subsidized more overtly, but roads require their share of tax dollars, too.\And when broad societal costs are part of the equation and transit's energy efficiency and advantages to the environment are weighed, rail and bus travel looks like an even better bargain. The UC Davis study notes that if these kinds of nonmonetary factors are considered, the gas tax would have to be raised more than $1 per gallon to finance roads.\In this context, Gov. Martin O'Malley's proposal to raise nearly $400 million annually to invest in Maryland transportation projects - particularly with its projected fraction-of-a-cent gas tax increase next year - may simply be too modest in scope.\Count the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as among those favoring a tax increase on the federal level. The conservative business group has called for more to be spent on intercity passenger rail, transit systems and ports, all of which could be paid for by higher gas taxes or perhaps a ""carbon tax to address global warming."" Looking at the numbers, it's difficult not to agree."

While Republican voters and polls have high expectations after the Nov. 4 election, I suggest they take a moment to contemplate its actual meaning and how these expectations may be realized.
\
First, the results were not, as some suggest, a protest vote against the incumbent politicians. The diverse group of Republicans ushered into office was a product of frustration with America's current economy. It was also a repudiation of the continual playing off of one American against another on an economic, racial or gender basis. Voters realize we are all Americans, and the commonality of our unique culture, not division, facilitates our success.
\
Further, this vote was not a directive to Republicans to compromise or work with Democrats to ""get things done."" We're in this situation precisely because too many things did get done (i.e. onerous legislation, executive actions, etc.). Did Democrats negotiate with Republicans in drafting and passing the Affordable Care Act? Absolutely not, nor were they obligated to. To the victor go the spoils, or at least the ability to drive the agenda.
\
The message was simple: The current policies of our president, governor and the Democratic Party, as a whole, have failed. Voters expect the implementation of Republican (i.e. conservative) principles to restore prosperity to all Americans. This country was built on the ideas, innovations and hard work of the individual. We need to assure that these values are encouraged, not punished, as is the case in our current regulatory and tax climate. And while government has an important role to play in any democratic society, its current role must be reduced in order for America to prosper.
\
Therefore, as the politicians measure the curtains, allow me to suggest an initial agenda.
\
Nationally, the Republican Congress must secure the border, rein in spending, repeal the Affordable Care Act and either authorize full-scale military action to quell any Islamist threats to America in Syria, Iraq or elsewhere in the Middle East, or remove all military resources from the region. The express purpose of war is victory. We need to restructure or abolish rogue administrative agencies, secure voting rights for all American citizens and ddress the Federal Reserve's role in the economy.
\
In Maryland, the governor must reduce spending and begin the repeal of certain taxes and fees. He can start with something as symbolic as eliminating all toll increases, and move on to roll back the gas tax and eliminate the rain tax. He can restructure and reduce the bureaucracy, returning agencies such as the Department of the Environment and the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation to an advisory role, not a police role in which they harass businesses with excessive fines and regulations. He can fast-track drilling for oil and natural gas and the development of the Cove Point export facility. Energy independence, creating high-paying jobs and expanding the tax base are laudable goals, and within reach. He can focus on infrastructure that facilitates a wide range of commerce. He can eliminate the proposed Purple and Red lines, and instead, modernize the port. He can commission, not study, the Route 301 bypass and a Bay Bridge from Calvert County to Cambridge. A majority of Marylanders voted to stop the continual misallocation of ransportation tax revenue; the funds are available.
\
I understand the limitations of dealing with the Democratic legislature. However, the governor has broad constitutional authority with respect to spending, appointments and the mission of state agencies. I expect results.
\
On a county level, we can rein in education spending, moving teachers into the classroom and out of administrative offices. We can expand charter schools and provide property tax credits for parents who choose nonpublic school options. We can lower the property tax rate and enact a permanent cap. We can resolve the public-sector and union structural pension issues. We can push for the repeal of the rain tax, the revenue from which benefits certain special interest groups. Instead, we can offer tax incentives to land owners for environmental improvements that have a tangible effect on our environment.
\
Every election is an opportunity. If the Republicans fail to resolve the issues of the day, they will have squandered the opportunity and should be replaced. The campaign is over. It's time to govern.

201,"Loss of lead-paint grant reveals city mismanagement\The hardest part of managing a government is deciding how best to allocate limited taxpayer funds among critical needs. It isn't making sure that dedicated funds are spent correctly and on time.\Or at least, it shouldn't be.\Unfortunately, last week we found out that Baltimore is losing federal funding specifically designed to help remove toxic lead paint from city houses due to mismanagement of its most recent grant (""City loses lead-paint funding,"" March 1).\The need for this program is evident, with thousands of Baltimore homes containing lead paint. The money for it had been allocated, with $4 million being budgeted by the federal government last year alone. But what was missing was the ability to manage the money correctly. This failure not only costs the city needed funds but will ensure that too many, including children, remain in harm's way.\That alone should be unacceptable to us all.\But as bad as this clear mismanagement is, what is more outrageous is the city's unwillingness to simply admit there was a mistake. Instead, they point the finger at past administrations. However, the grant was not pulled because of past problems but because of current ones.\Baltimore's citizens deserve to be certain that services that are promised and paid for are delivered. It is clear the city needs to implement additional controls over how it manages its funds and more public disclosure of how those funds are spent.\HUD has tagged Baltimore as a ""high-risk"" grantee for additional lead abatement funds. Unfortunately, because of the city administration's management failure, it's the people of Baltimore who are at ""high-risk.""\Otis Rolley, Baltimore The writer is a candidate for mayor of Baltimore.\An easy fix for Baltimore's towing mess\It is clear from the facts revealed by the federal corruption investigation into kickbacks related to Baltimore towing operations that the present system is broken and needs to be fixed. In place of the current medallion system, which arbitrarily limits competition and creates an environment that breeds corruption, the city should have a system that is open to any company that can document that it meets certain equipment and operational standards and can post a performance bond or meet certain liability insurance coverage limits.\Baltimore should establish clear standards and collect a fee from the companies applying to be authorized towers. The city should not set the base prices or mileage fees that companies charge, but the company should be required to disclose those fees and how they will be calculated. The companies would then be free to charge whatever fee they deem appropriate, provided that the fee is publicly listed.\At the scene of an accident or a disabled vehicle, the police officers should have a preprinted list of all of the companies that meet the established standards and lists the fees that the company will charge for a tow. The list would be presented to the vehicle owner, together with a disclosure signed by the owner or driver acknowledging the fact that the list was supplied and verifying that the responding police officer made no attempt to steer the owner or driver to a specific company.\The list could be published in the newspaper and be made available online. Opening up the system and requiring that fees be published would help reduce towing fees by injecting competition into the system, which would go a long way toward correcting the inefficiencies inherent in the type of closed system that currently exists.\Fixing this problem is easy. Overcoming the cozy relationship that the medallion companies have with city officials is tough.\Joseph T. ""Jody"" Landers III, Baltimore The writer is a former city councilman and is a prospective candidate for mayor.\How to raise the gas tax\I agree completely with letter writer Dennis Larkin (""There couldn't be a worse time to raise the gas tax,"" March 4) that there couldn't be a worse time (when the price of gas is going up) to raise the gas tax. The best time would be when the price is going down - add 1 cent per gallon for, say, every 5 cents the price falls.\If the taxman didn't tell us, nobody would notice.\Mike Brown, Columbia\O'Malley's wind farm: too expensive, inflexible\Gov. Martin O'Malley's proposal to require Maryland utilities to buy electricity at above-market rates from wind turbines located in the Atlantic Ocean may create a nice green credential for an aspiring national politician, but it would be bad for Maryland (""O'Malley wind plan draws questions,"" March 4).\The proposal would require every Marylander to pay more for energy than would be the case if utilities could buy electricity on the open market. In effect, it is a tax on energy, with the tax proceeds going to the wind farm developers. If enacted, this proposal would make Maryland a more expensive and less desirable place to live and do business than many other states.\The plan is also bad for environmental policy, as it locks in place a high-priced technology.\The plan is also bad for environmental policy, as it locks in place a high-priced technology. Maryland will be committed to this uneconomic technology, thereby making it more difficult for innovative ways of producing green energy to find a market.\Robert A. McIntire, Towson"
202," District 31 Del. Joan Cadden's name was omitted from a letter that ran in the May 20 issue of The Anne Arundel County Sun.\ The delegate co-wrote the letter, which concerned the Marley Creek improvement project, with District 31 Dels. Charles Kolodziejski and W. Ray Huff.\ Layoffs questioned\ From: Joseph Cosgrove\ Pasadena\ In response to the article in the Arundel County Sun on Friday, May 1, 1992 {""Council members cool to Neall layoff measure""}, the County Council appeared reluctant to pass a bill requested by County Executive Robert Neall that would clear the way for laying off employees in the next few months. Mr. Neall has asked the council to clarify the layoff procedure, essentially prohibiting workers due to get the ax from bumping employees with less seniority in other departments and classifications.\ Defenders of this bill say that it would be placing workers in other departments and classifications they could not handle.\ When new employees are hired, they must be trained, so why not retrain your current work force?\ They say management decisions, such as who works at what jobs, should be left up to the department heads. These so-called ""heads"" are the people who go to school and get a degree, then come in and expect to control the work force. Can they type 50 words a minute? Do they know electrical circuits? Do they know what a water line is? Have they ever opened a manhole? According to the ""book"" they have, but let them go out on the streets and try it.\ Michael Milanowski, the county labor relations director, said that if the council fails to pass the measure, the county would likely consult with its attorneys and proceed anyway with the layoff procedures. Sounds like a dictatorship to me, instead of a democratic system, and I'm sure the American Federation of State and County Employees (AFSCME) has attorneys also.\ As far as AFSCME is concerned, I am sure it is doing the best it can representing its dues-paying members. As a dedicated union person for over 30 years, my motto has always been, ""United we stand, divided we fall.""\ We're all concerned about saving trees, saving fish and protecting wildlife -- but trees don't pay taxes, fish don't pay taxes and animals don't pay taxes. County employees pay taxes, and they vote.\ And as far as subcontracting work out for services, I'd rather have a county employee serve me than some ""rent-a-company.""\ In closing, remember, Mr. Neall, we're all working for the same four reasons, and that's breakfast, lunch, dinner and a mortgage payment.\ Sheriff on the high road\ From: Robert G. Pepersack Sr.\ Sheriff, Anne Arundel County\ Restive: According to Webster's Dictionary, this is defined as ""stubbornly resisting control."" In the latest soap-opera report -- via the media -- this was how I was described. They are right.\ Here's why:\ * Over 80 percent of the taxpayers of our county did not expect me to take over an abandoned and bankrupt Sheriff's Office, accept initial under-funding and simply roll over and play political wimp for the sake of furthering political causes and keeping ""harmony in a political party.""\ * I was voted in by the people. I serve the people with honor. If that is ""restive"" behavior, then maybe more politicians should put the people first. Then maybe the country would not be suffering from political-office-holders flu.\ * The ""bad behavior"" of the sheriff -- as I've been called recently -- is not ill-mannered. I just will not be the county's political soccer ball for aspiring political players.\ * Also, the under-funding issue of the Sheriff's Office -- by the admission of the County Council and the county administration -- now is being called a ""comic gig"" starring Bob Pepersack. Well, as they say, when in Rome, do as the Romans.\ I think the County Council and the county executive should win Emmys for the directing and producing talents in carrying on a single-issue situation -- under-funding -- into a weekly comic sitcom, costing taxpayers thousands of dollars for each show.\ * The question that is long overdue is: Who really holds the Anne Arundel restive personality?\ Let's look at the facts:\ 1. The entire dollar amount that the County Executive started this witch hunt over is one-tenth of one-tenth of 1 percent of the county budget.\ 2. Tiring of not ""gaining control and rewriting the Constitution,"" the under-funding kudzu has been given to the County Council by the administration for behind-the-scenes directing. However, unfortunately, the ""Low-Road Show"" continues, regardless of who is directing.\ 3. It's time that everyone lays their budget, perks, salaries, and productivity on the table. Let's look at how much money the county's officials have spent -- and continue to spend -- on items such as expenditures on the Bay Bridge Walk. Or where, why, how many, and how much do hubcaps cost? The facts show, and the officials have been told, ""The only hubcaps on a sheriff's office vehicle were donated.""\ My career has stayed on the high road. I am very inexperienced in traveling on the low road -- as we have faced for the past month. However, because of my mandate from an overwhelming majority of the good people of this county, I will continue to ""stubbornly resist over under-funding and then be taken to the woodshed for speaking out.""\ I think the time has come for the County Council members and the county executive to join me on the high road and cost-effectively fund budgets and look at the productivity of each county office.\ I'm ready. The people's Sheriff's Office has now rated as one of the best in the state. What about the rest of Anne Arundel government?\ We're working on creek\ From: W. Ray Huff\ Charles Kolodziejski\ District 31 Delegates\ We are writing in response to B. J. Poteet's letter printed in the Anne Arundel County Sun, Sunday, May 3, 1992. Many community leaders have been working to restore Marley Creek. It often takes several years to get this type of project done.\ Marley Creek has never been ignored by your district representatives. We have numerous news articles and correspondence from the Army Corps of Engineers, The Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment. In fact, we have a lengthy report in front of us right now regarding Marley Creek, which we received April 1992.\ The Corps of Engineers has been holding up the project, but through the efforts of Tom McMillen, a lot has recently been accomplished to help resolve the problems. There are certain areas the corps will not let us do, and the report has also recommended that the proposed dredging impacts be reduced by limiting the main channel width.\ The Waterway Improvement Program Proposed Projects for FY 1993 included Marley Creek dredging. A matching funds grant for the project has been approved by the legislature this year. The state and county are under way with their dredging projects. Working on the revisions for the Marley Creek restoration is now proposed. The Marley Creek dredging project has been in the budget for many years.\ The updated review/report is too long to print in the newspaper. However, if an association requests a copy, perhaps another could be made. The recommendations are too lengthy to provide each individual a copy.\ Marley Creek residents have our continuing support in this worthwhile project, which we have never ignored. We have met on-site many times and have constantly approved funding for our district waterway improvements.\ Taxes must be raised\ From: W. Ray Huff\  District 31 Delegate\ Many people have asked me why I voted for the tax package that was proposed for the House of Delegates.\ I stood on the House floor many times protesting some of the taxes that were proposed in this package. Since I was unable to get some of these proposed taxes eliminated from the package and because I did not want to see a ""doomsday"" budget take effect where the state and all of our citizens would suffer tremendously, I voted for two of the three tax bills.\ People often ask me why the state needs more money. The state of Maryland is deteriorating due to the lack of tax money coming into the state. Seventy-five thousand jobs have been eliminated since this recession began. Those people pay about $2,000 a year per person in Maryland state taxes. When people are unemployed, the state's costs increase, not decrease.\ In January 1987, the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent, compared with January 1992, when 7.3 percent of Maryland's population was unemployed. Some of the state's increased costs are due in part to the need for more Medicaid, prison and transportation assistance that these entities need to meet the demands of the Maryland citizens.\ The latest figures reflect that 219,219 Maryland citizens are welfare recipients. The cost of Medicaid has also increased substantially.\ In 1987, 341,529 people received Medicaid benefits to the tune of $904,855,337. The 1991 figures indicate that 40,000 more people were receiving Medicaid benefits totaling $1,480,741,199.\ Maryland also needs to maintain our prison population which is, unfortunately, increasing. The Department of Fiscal Services for the state has estimated that 21,504 people will be incarcerated in Maryland in 1993. This is a 32.2 percent increase from the number of incarcerated people in 1990. This increase is due in part to the fact that the people ask for mandatory sentences for numerous crimes such as drug trafficking and driving under the influence. Therefore, these institutions' population has also increased.\ Additional costs are being incurred by the state to construct items that were not environmentally necessary 10 years ago. For example, in the early 1980s, the state began constructing sound barriers throughout the state to help alleviate some of the state's noise problems. Approximately $70 million has been spent for the construction of these barriers. Before the last increase in the gas tax in 1987, Maryland had 14,317 lane miles of state roads. Today, Maryland has 15,239 lane miles of state roads. All these roads and bridges must be kept clean, maintained and repaired in order that Maryland keep current with the transportation needs of its citizens. In the 1992 budget, $1.5 billion has already been cut from the state's budget.\ As a state, Maryland has so much to offer people. Top-quality transportation services such as our light rail system and well-maintained roads and parks are among Maryland's attractions. However, in order to provide these services and facilities for our citizens, we need money to keep our economy going.\ Two sources of money Maryland uses to keep the economy going are the collection of sales and corporate taxes. The state collected $29,017,432 less in sales tax that was collected before the recession. A decrease of $32.2 million in the amount of corporate tax collected can also be seen.\ Last year, few state vehicles were purchased, and every state bank account was ""robbed,"" including the rainy day fund and the open space fund. If the doomsday budget had gone into effect, Maryland would have definitely lost its triple-A bond rating. This would have cost the state more in interest -- approximately $5 million more per year based on the bond market. Maryland also stood to lose $1.2 million in federal transportation funds.\  However, by enacting the presently proposed budget, we will be putting 2,400 people back to work from the private sector. Putting people back to work is one of the most important things that needs to be done during a recession. I hope you will have a better understanding of why taxes had to be increased after looking at these figures showing the increase in costs to the state.\ Standards for volunteers\ From: Bonnie Conrad\ Pasadena\ In response to the letter from Harriet Heldenfels Yake, president of the Junior League of Annapolis, asking for adult volunteers to work with children, I ask:\ What criterion is used by the Junior League of Annapolis to determine that a volunteer is emotionally, mentally, morally and educationally qualified to work with children?\ Children are our country's most important asset! Too often, volunteer groups become so involved in the idea they are doing good for children. They tend to believe that a person, because that person is good enough to volunteer, is also good enough to work with children.\ I've seen ""bad"" volunteers damage children the group is trying to help because the group is lax in testing, investigating, etc. volunteers to determine if the volunteer is truly qualified to work with children.\ I'm not accusing the Junior League of being lax. I am simply asking to know what it, or any similar group, does to qualify its volunteers and thus protect the children it seeks to help.\ Lighthizer saga continues\ From: Stuart G. Morris\ St. Margaret's\ ""The Lighthizer Years"" (1982-1990) have ended in Anne Arundel County, but continue merrily on at the state level with the heavy pecuniary burden now borne by all of Maryland's taxpayers.\ The shift began with Orville's {Lighthizer} appointment as transportation secretary, followed several hours later by the hiring of seven cronies at an annual tab of $569,376.\ He is nothing if not generous in sharing the public purse.\ Sometime later, following the Dontay Carter disaster at the Motor Vehicle Administration, Lighthizer said he would seek $20 million in the state's next capital budget for computers to check pictures and fingerprints of license applicants.\ Since we are told that an employee issued a license to Carter for a reported $50 payoff, a far less-expensive screening system would be honest workers.\ Doubtless feeling the need for a European vacation after all this fiscal activity, there followed Lighthizer, seven other Department of Transportation {DOT} employees, plus two from Economic and Employment Development (thus avoiding the terrors of loneliness) to Holland, for the ostensible purpose of determining how Amsterdam's Schipol Airport and the port of Rotterdam work together.\ The taxpayers tab for this junket is said to exceed $14,000.\ Are 10 people needed to figure out what the Dutch do well?\ If so, may we inquire how many are involved in changing a light bulb at the Maryland DOT offices?\ Then, on May 1, we were socked with an extra 5 cents per gallon of gasoline, courtesy of Messrs. Lighthizer and Schaefer.\ Rumor has it that they were upset that gasoline prices had fallen below $1 per gallon.\ And yet, in this shifting and uncertain world, it is comforting to know that one thing is changeless:\ That Orville James Lighthizer will continue to fully exploit the public purse.\ Who could ask for anything more?\ We all know the answer to that one!"
203," Hidden Costs Of Recycling\ I am writing in response to the article ""Aberdeen recycling is a double saver"" (April 11).\ It stated that there has been a 36 percent decrease in Aberdeen's trash, and that the reason is greater recycling. I don't think that's a valid assumption.\ First of all, while some people have discovered they can cut trash fees substantially by recycling, others have discovered they can cut bills to zero by dumping their trash surreptitiously. While only a few Aberdeen citizens would do such a thing, that's all it takes to make our vacant lots eyesores.\ Additionally, when people discover on trash day that they don't have the correct sticker, or on grocery day that it is a choice between baby food and stickers (didn't the landlord used to pay for trash removal?), they probably set aside garbage until the next week (look for a story on Aberdeen's growing rat population). Thus March's total is way down, but April's may well bounce back.\ Adding to the factor, for many people, the resolution to aggressively reduce garbage may well go the way of most other noble resolutions.\ But every little bit is great for the environment, right? I wince as I see the trash truck stop for an extra minute or two at each house to check that the correct sticker for each bag's weight is correctly affixed. The recycling truck too has to slow down, so collectors can peer through the translucent blue bags to make sure people haven't cheated by throwing real trash in with their recycling. Are those trucks subject to emission controls? I see an awful lot of air pollution and wasted gas. I've even wasted some gas myself, running to the convenience store for stickers. (Perhaps this is a trick to bail out the state through greater gas tax receipts?) . . .\ I can't believe that this program will save citizens any money in the long run when the costs are so high, not to mention extra hours and pay for trash collectors, additional staff to administer the program, the cost of printing and distributing stickers (which, by the way, end up in the landfill, a small quantity, but extra trash nonetheless). Volunteers are great, but will they stick it out for the long haul?\ Using a pro-rated charge based on water bills, as mentioned in your article by Edward Somody, and originally proposed by Councilman G. DeWayne Curry, is an elegant solution.\ Small households pay less than large households. The people who have installed water-saving shower heads and who turn off the water while they brush their teeth are likely to be the same ones who aggressively recycle, and they are rewarded.\ I'm glad trash for March was down and that recycling is up. . . . But please don't let one article early in the program be your last word on the subject. Come back in a month or two and look hard at the benefits relative to the costs, both direct and hidden.\ Lauren Sheriff\ Aberdeen\ `N.J. Transplant'\ I am writing in regard to the ""New Jersey transplant,"" Theresa Pierno.\ I can't imagine how anyone who has met this remarkable lady in person could believe that she doesn't care about Harford County. I have met Mrs. Pierno, and have found her to be a caring and dynamic personality.\ Mrs. Pierno has made her home in Maryland, has children attending schools here and obviously cared enough about Harford County to become an elected official.\ From what I have observed, Council President Jeffrey Wilson, Mrs. Pierno and their fellow council members have certainly listened and do try to make the right decisions. I try to attend the County Council meetings whenever possible, because I want to be more aware of what is happening in Harford County, because this is my home now, and being a fellow transplant with Mrs. Pierno is an honor. . . .\ Kathy Carmello\ Abingdon\ Fire Volunteers\ The Bel Air Volunteer Fire Company has begun its annual fund drive for 1993. This fund drive is separate from the ambulance fund drive which is held in the fall. Property owners receive in the mail a request for a donation based on the assessed value of the property that is protected by the fire company.\ Bel Air Volunteer Fire Company provides fire and emergency medical services to more than 50,000 people in Bel Air and the surrounding communities. Last year, volunteers responded to 3,460 emergency calls and gave more than 40,000 hours of personal time to train and provide professional and competent emergency services. The fire company responded to emergencies involving property valued at more than $137 million, yet the estimated loss was held to less than $700,000.\ The fire company depends on the community for its support. Since the fire department is volunteer, 100 percent of the donation is directed toward operations, maintenance and replacement of equipment, training and buildings. The fire company emphasizes that regardless of whether or not a donation is made, no one will be denied emergency services. Donations are tax-deductible and further assist the community by keeping taxes and insurance rates low.\ Anyone having questions may contact Thomas Zecha at 848-5151.\ Edward Hopkins\ Bel Air\ The writer is First Assistant Chief of the Bel Air Volunteer Fire Company.\ Neighbors In Need\ A heartfelt thanks to everyone in Harford County who has participated in the Neighbors In Need program in helping those less fortunate.\ The Department of Social Services serves more than 3,000 needy families. Neighbors In Need is not government-funded and strictly functions on contributions. Our Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter holiday programs have an incredible 656 sponsors. Neighbors In Need provides holiday help, furniture, food and financial assistance to individuals in need throughout the year.\ If anyone desires more information concerning the Neighbors In Need program, please call 836-4778. To the citizens of Harford County, a job well done. Thank you for the kindness that was shown to others during the Easter season.\ Joy J. Rich\ Bel Air\ The writer is director of Neighbors In Need for Harford County.\ Fair Conflict Blocks Learning\ I am writing on behalf of the board of directors of Harford County Farm Bureau to express its opposition to the starting of public school before Labor Day.\ This early start will coincide with the Maryland State Fair. There are many children of Farm Bureau members, as well as those of non-members, who participate in the fair. . . .\ We understand that students who wish to participate in the fair can obtain an excused absence. However, you are putting those students and their parents in a position where they must choose between two educational experiences (school or the fair), both of which have great value.\ Our other concern is for those students and parents who are not part of the agricultural community of Harford County. . . .\ Harford County's officials can create all the ""farm programs"" that they wish, but the key to survival of farming in Harford County depends on two things -- economic viability and understanding of agriculture by its citizens and young people.\ Anything less dooms us to suburbia.\ Lee D. McDaniel\ Darlington\ The writer is president of the Harford County Farm Bureau. This is a copy of a letter sent to Harford County Superintendent of Schools Ray Keech."
204," When U.S. Representative Thomas McMillen knocked on the door of a Brooklyn Park home recently, he was puzzled when an 80-year-woman answered.\ ""The voter lists didn't show anyone that old had ever been registered there,"" McMillen, D-4th, recalled Tuesday night while campaigning for state Sen. Philip C. Jimeno, who is engaged in a fierce battle to retain his seat. ""So I asked her, 'How come in all those years you never voted?' ""She said, 'Oh, that only encourages them politicians.' Well, right now, we Democrats need all the encouragement we can get.""\ McMillen was at the Roland Terrace Democratic Club in Brooklyn Park this week rallying support for Jimeno, who is running against Republican Delegate John R. Leopold for the District 31 Senate seat, as well as for the Democratic candidates for House of Delegates.\ The congressman has joined a parade of prominent Democrats -- including Gov. William Donald Schaefer -- stumping for Jimeno, who many consider the underdog against Leopold.\ The election pits Jimeno's populist organization against Leopold's money and relentless style of campaigning.\ An insurance agent and father of two, Jimeno has developed a loyal political following through his community activities as a band parent, Little League coach and officer in his Brooklyn Park neighborhood association.\ Jimeno, 43, was elected to the House of Delegates in 1978, re- elected in 1982 and appointed to the Senate in 1985 when then-Sen. Jerome Connell was convicted of federal income tax evasion. He was elected to the seat in 1986.\ A full-time lawmaker and political consultant, Leopold has been a headache for District 31 Democrats since he stepped off the plane from Hawaii eight years ago. His year-round, door-to-door and roadside campaigns have helped him create a personal appeal apart from mainline Republicans.\ Leopold, 47, who served eight years in the Hawaiian legislature, moved to Anne Arundel County in 1982 after suffering a series of political defeats in the islands. He lost his 1978 bid for governor of Hawaii and a 1980 attempt to return to the Hawaiian Senate.\ But, less than a year after moving to Pasadena, Leopold won a Maryland House of Delegates seat, defeating incumbent Democrat William Burkhead and becoming the only Republican ever elected in the district.\ Now, Leopold's bid for the Senate has Democratic politicians countywide rallying against him.\ ""We've just found that he plays to the crowd and he just isn't responsible,"" said Sen. Michael J. Wagner, a Democrat from nearby District 32. ""He's a master of taking credit for things he didn't do and placing blame where it doesn't belong.""\ ""The Republican Party threw him out of Hawaii,"" McMillen said. ""Now the Democratic Party has a chance to throw him out of Maryland.""\ Once largely blue-collar and dominated politically by a half-dozen Democratic clubs, the district now includes increasing numbers of young, mobile professionals. Still, the issues are the same: taxes and the environment.\ Depending on which community activist you speak to, Jimeno and Leopold both are champions of the environment. Rock Creek activists credit Leopold with bringing the plight of that tributary to the attention of the state Department of the Environment. Other North County activists praise Jimeno for passing new clean air requirements last spring to protect residents from the chemical industries located nearby in Baltimore.\ Both candidates present themselves as fiscally conservative. But, on the stump, Leopold frequently notes that only he opposed Baltimore's new baseball stadium and, in 1987, voted against a 5-cent increase in the gasoline tax, which finances state roads and transportation projects.\ Leopold said he would rather have seen the money being spent on Camden Yards stadium used to construct roads.\ ""He's a foxy, clever politician,"" Wagner said. ""He votes against the gas tax and yet he wants to build roads and bridges.""\ ""(Leopold) talks out of both sides of his mouth,"" Jimeno said. ""He publicly supported projects like the widening of Mountain Road, but then he didn't support the funding for them.""\ Leopold's two major advantages in the campaign are money and name recognition.\ During the last three years, he has campaigned nearly non- stop for county executive. Although he never officially registered to enter that race, he amassed $163,464 in preparation for it and attempted to make his name a household word through public appearances and advertising.\ Last June, when he decided he couldn't defeat former Delegate Robert Neall in the Republican primary, Leopold entered the Senate race and brought his campaign chest with him.\ Several who contributed to Leopold's county executive campaign complained last summer they didn't support his bid against Jimeno, who so far has raised $40,703 to finance his re- election. But Leopold said no one has asked him to return their contributions.\ Jimeno's camp generally concedes Leopold is more widely known.\ Vivian Stockus, a Bodkin Point resident, said she met Leopold three years ago at a Glen Burnie carnival and soon after changed her party affiliation from Democrat to Republican so she could vote for him. Since then, he has knocked on her door campaigning several times, she said.\ ""He's very kind to people,"" said Stockus, a retired employee of Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore County. ""And he's a good listener.""\ Stockus has heard of Jimeno, but said she has never met him and has trouble pronouncing his name. ""How do you pronounce (Jimeno)?"" she said.\ ""He's from Brooklyn Park, isn't he? I don't even know how long he was there.""\ Severna Park resident Steve Beverage, a 42-year-old carpenter and registered Democrat, said he, too, has seen Leopold in the median strip waving to motorists and met the candidate several times during his door-to-door visits.\ ""Phil Jimeno, I've never met,"" Beverage said. ""But Leopold has been right there at my door.""\ ""Campaigning is like studying for an exam,"" Leopold said. ""If you do your homework every day, you don't have to cram the night before.""\ Jimeno agreed Leopold may be a better campaigner, but it's an admission he hopes to turn to his advantage.\ ""I've got a family and a job,"" Jimeno said. ""I simply can't campaign seven days a week. When he's out campaigning in the morning, I'm driving my daughter's car pool to school. That sums it up right there.""\ State House records show Leopold has missed more than 100 votes on 48 separate days during the last four years, Jimeno added. The senator has not missed any in four years.\ ""He's not a full-time legislator,"" Jimeno said. ""He's a full-time campaigner. He's out standing on street corners, knocking on doors.""\ Leopold has dismissed the criticism, saying the number of missed votes is insignificant compared to the thousands he has made.\ To overcome Leopold's advantages, Jimeno said he plans to mobilize his constituent supporters and political allies from outside the district.\ Schaefer is conducting a public opinion poll for him; McMillan and County Executive O. James Lighthizer are helping raise money.\ Rain yesterday afternoon forced Jimeno to postpone a series of mass rallies in Brooklyn Park, Glen Burnie, Pasadena and Carvel Beach.\ Rescheduled today, about 300 of his supporters will line roads in those communities, greeting home-bound commuters with Jimeno campaign signs.\ Tomorrow, the senator said he hopes an equal number will participate in a massive door-knocking campaign.\ ""You have to maximize the resources you have,"" Jimeno said. ""We have people, we have signs.""\ Unlike Leopold, who is running alone and has no volunteer organization, Jimeno also will benefit from the support of his United 31st ticket, which includes incumbent Delegates W. Ray Huff, D-Pasadena, and Charles W.\ ""Stokes"" Kolodziejski, D-Carvel Beach.\ Perhaps the most excitement on the ticket is being generated by its fourth member, political newcomer and delegate candidate Joan Cadden, a Brooklyn Park businesswoman and beautician. A former school board member and vice president of the Greater Brooklyn Park Council, Cadden used a well-organized group of campaign volunteers to win a crowded Democratic primary.\ Cadden, whose campaign volunteers are known for their green polo shirts emblazoned with the candidate's name, has been given the duty of organizing the ticket's door-to-door campaign.\ ""Joan's organization -- I mean in terms of man and woman power - - is a complete plus for Phil,"" said Trevor Kiessling, a delegate candidate who lost in the Democratic primary. ""Joan did such effective door-to-door work, that's an excellent move for them.""\ On the other hand, Republican Evelyn Kampmeyer said the ticket may hurt Jimeno.\ ""Both Delegates Huff and Kolodziejski are weak links,"" said Kampmeyer, one of three GOP delegate candidates. ""And I think the sheriff candidate (incumbent William Huggins) might be a problem too.""\ Although running independently of Leopold, Kampmeyer and the other GOP candidates hope to follow in his footsteps by knocking off one of the incumbents.\ James J. Riley, who changed his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican last summer, may be the strongest of the three GOP challengers.\ A veteran campaigner and retired school teacher, Riley received the most GOP votes in the primary. The Severna Park resident narrowly lost his 1986 bid for a delegate seat, trailing Kolodziejski by only 150 votes in that general election. Kolodziejski ""is still the most vulnerable,"" he said.\ Predicting a severe downturn in the economy, Riley is promising voters to represent ""the economic little person. That's what I am, lower-middle class.""\ ""I like what Riley says,"" said Steve Beverage from Severna Park. ""The economy is going down; taxes are going up. I'm scared to death.""\ Kampmeyer, a retired high school principal, said she's fighting for ""quality education,"" and touts her ability to raise students' standardized test scores by at least 15 points within five years.\ A former member of the Anne Arundel County Board of Social Services, Kampmeyer also said she's working with ""a team of scientists"" -- four private citizens she's asked to help her - - to solve the district's environmental problems.\ Douglas Arnold, an advertising salesman for the Capital/ Gazette newspapers, said education and housing are his key issues. He said he will release position papers on each in the coming weeks, outlining plans to increase parental involvement and provide affordable housing for young families and seniors.\ Credit: SUN STAFF"
205," Over-Population\ Your paper's story on the World Bank's report on development and the environment included the words, ""Alarm is sounded on rising population."" The bank's proposals, however, centered on accommodating the expected rise in population while protecting the environment. The only recommendation directly related to population was better access to education for girls and women in the developing countries.\ Time after time we read reports and comments about environmental degradation, pollution, overwhelmed resources, poverty and possible global warming, but population growth is rarely mentioned in relation to these disastrous trends.\ It is practically impossible to solve problems of this nature while more and more people need more and more opportunities and resources. Population growth is a basic problem that affects all the other problems, and will negate nearly every effort to improve the outlook for people in the poorer countries.\ In spite of the severe population problem the world is facing, President Reagan cut off the United States contribution to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities. Then President Bush, counting his votes and support from the far right, made the unconscionable decision to continue the same policy.\ I hope that The Sun will continue to emphasize population issues whenever that is appropriate.\ Carleton W. Brown\ Elkton\ City Needs\ Your editorial, ""Schmoke Takes on Congress,"" begins well enough. It reports the mayor's position in his meeting with House Speaker Tom Foley, in which he described the critical need to shift Pentagon funds to domestic purposes. But the editorial ends disappointingly by not supporting his request.\ Mayor Schmoke and the other large city mayors need our support. They need support from the media, from public and private community organizations, churches and synagogues and from individuals.\ The mayor is correct in insisting that the ""firewalls"" in the 1990 budget agreement be torn down so that defense funds can be used in an attempt to ""save our cities."" Too many of the programs being suggested by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress are inadequate and fall short of the mark.\ The Baltimore Jewish Council is one organization that has recognized this need and we have asked our congressional representatives to vote accordingly. We would welcome The Sun to come aboard.\ William H. Engelman\ Baltimore\ The writer is president of the Baltimore Jewish Council.\ Women's Lacrosse\ I think that your May 20 editorial, ""Two New Champions,"" was a missed opportunity.\ The crowning of new champions in both the Preakness and the America's Cup are significant sports events, deserving of recognition. However, another championship was also decided during the same weekend and it deserves much greater recognition than you accorded to it.\ I am referring to the achievements of a group of talented young women from the University of Maryland College Park, who ended a brilliant season by capturing the NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship. During the weekend of May 16 and 17, they battled and defeated both the University of Virginia and Harvard University to claim the national title.\ This team deserves greater recognition, not just because they were victorious, but simply because of their efforts. Too often we honor only those who win and forget that the real honor is in making the effort. These women truly have had to balance the rigors of their academic programs with the rigors of collegiate athletics.\ Had a men's team won a national championship, its accomplishments probably would have received greater recognition. I hope that in the future The Sun will make an effort to provide greater coverage of women's athletics.\ Furthermore, at a time when the news concerning college athletics is often negative, I think that every opportunity should be taken to show the many positives of college athletics.\ To the women's lacrosse team of the University of Maryland, I say congratulations on an excellent job. Thank you for an enjoyable and exciting season.\ Timothy Pula\ College Park\ Selfish Women\ Reading the article ""Single Mothers by Choice,"" I am struck by the numerous references to the happiness of the mothers or the special problems confronting the mothers or how motherhood has met the mother's needs.\ Not until the end does the article even address the needs and happiness of the child, with the child quoted saying that male friends of his mother are second best to having a real father.\ No mention is made of the numerous studies which show that children's needs are best met in two-parent families, whatever their socio-economic strata.\ While I would commend any woman who, finding herself pregnant, chooses life for her child, I can see only selfishness in single women who deliberately plan a pregnancy.\ They should not fool themselves about whose happiness they are pursuing. And, we as a society need to convey that single motherhood, while it may at times be the only option, is not an option to be desired.\ The children and society are paying and will continue to pay the price for the proliferation of single-parent families.\ Carol J. Willis\ Ellicott City\ Highways Needed\ Your ""Beating Gridlock"" editorial of May 7 and the May 12 reply by David L. Winstead, chairman of the Maryland Transportation Commission, are to be applauded for their advocacy of more planning for our transportation needs and the need to reduce congestion on our roads.\ However, we are concerned that many of our state's leaders in government and business still believe that mass transit is the only answer to our current transportation problems.\ If the truth be known, mass transit in Maryland is used by fewer than one-tenth of the state's citizens, yet it has enormous capital and operating costs that are only going to increase.\ These costs are so large that, according to the Maryland Department of Transportation, mass transit will comprise half of its fiscal 1993 operating budget -- more than $300 million.\ Our greatest fear is that the Maryland Department of Transportation will forgo highway improvements that can ease congestion to meet the funding needs of mass transit. And, in fact, Maryland mass transit's needs continue to divert funds targeted to help preserve our highway system.\ For the next two years, 20 percent of the recent gas tax increase will cover operating costs of the Washington Area Mass Transit Administration. Because of this, needed road improvement projects will not go forward as planned.\ In our opinion, the funding of mass transit cannot come at the expense of the Maryland state highway system. To do so amounts to economic suicide for the state.\ Why? Because just about everything bought or sold in Maryland spends some time on our roads before reaching the store shelves. If Maryland's highways are not maintained and improved, the cost of living and doing business in this state will go up, discouraging businesses, their owners and employees from living and working in Maryland.\ Mass transit can move people, but not their goods and services.\ We do not advocate the building of roads just for the sake of construction. We suggest a balanced approach to multi-modal (transit and highway) planning, not one that builds mass transit at the expense of our highways' legitimate needs.\ Finally, Maryland can no longer afford to finance the operation of two urban public transit systems at the gas pump. In our opinion, the gas tax is a user fee paid for by those who use the highways. Alternative funding for mass transit must be found.\ Bob Latham\ Glen Burnie\ The writer is executive director of Marylanders for Safe and Efficient Highways.\ Elks Lodge\ This concerns Roger Simon's scurrilous and possibly slanderous May 17 column about private clubs and a fraternal order, Elks Lodge 622 in Annapolis.\ Many readers here have inferred that he knows nothing about those clubs and even less about the Elks.\ The boisterous, bawdy conduct he described would never be permitted at the Elks Lodge, which is frequently host to members' wives and female guests.\ Furthermore, none of the private clubs indicated would tolerate such unacceptable conduct. He would have to look elsewhere in Annapolis for instances of that character.\ Despite Mr. Simon's slanted and sour opinions, shared by your editorial writers to some degree, in all likelihood most people believe that we Americans have the right of free association.\ If the city ordinance disguised as a civil rights bill could be put to referendum, it would be overwhelmingly defeated.\ Ample justification can be made for the existence of single gender organizations, such as the many fraternal/sororal groups, some of which enjoy federal, state and city tax exemption.\ The Annapolis law restricting the issuance of liquor licenses to private groups only to those that admit to membership without regard to gender was initiated by a small minority of far-out liberals, aided and abetted by the so-called American Civil Liberties Union.\ These zealots would have the city empowered to regulate the membership policies of any private group seeking a liquor license. That smacks of totalitarianism.\ While a convincing argument for the law might be made in the case of business and civic organizations, as well as recreational clubs (yacht, golf, tennis, etc.), it is unreasonable to have city government dictate membership regulations to fraternal or sororal organizations. It may also be unconstitutional.\ It is abundantly obvious that the initiators of the ordinance have singled out certain groups which they aim to destroy. One has to wonder which group will be next on the hit list.\ Gil Crandall\ Annapolis"
206,"
Local businesses typically pull out the boxing gloves to fight a new tax or regulation that's bound to be proposed each year during the legislative session.
\
But they may not need to put up as much of a front in Annapolis this year.
\
As companies contend with a recession, dwindling sales and cutbacks in spending, state officials and business leaders said they don't expect new taxes in 2009.
\
""You don't want to kick the business community when it's down,"" said Del. Ron George, R-Arnold, who also owns jewelry stores in downtown Annapolis and Severna Park. ""If you mention taxes, fees or regulations, they are saying, 'No, not this year.' ""
\
Sen. John Astle, D-Annapolis, vice chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he too doesn't see any interest in increasing taxes.
\
""Proposals that would add additional burden on businesses are not going to go anyplace,"" he said.
\
That's good news for Anne Arundel businesses that were hammered with a bevy of new taxes passed as part of a November 2007 special session plan to close the state's roughly $1.5 billion deficit.
\
Last year, businesses faced income, titling, tobacco and corporate tax increases last year as well as a rise in the state sales tax.
\
""We understand from leadership that there is not an environment in either house right now to increase taxes,"" said Karen Syrylo, CPA and state taxation consultant for the Maryland Chamber of Commerce in Annapolis. ""We are hearing that (tax) proposals are not going anywhere.""
\
Shaun Adamec, spokesman for Gov. Martin O'Malley, said the taxes, coupled with budget cuts and spending reductions, have helped the state deal with its structural deficit. Mr. O'Malley also eliminated more than 1,500 state positions, mostly through attrition, since he took office, he said. These measures helped Maryland avoid being in a structural deficit on top of poor economic conditions the way California is, he said.
\
As the state faces a $2 billion deficit this year, Mr. O'Malley is looking to make sure the budget cuts he makes, and that the General Assembly votes on, are ones that not only maintain the core mission of each state agency, but also fall within the guidelines of balancing the budget, he said.
\
""The priority is obviously not to put any undue burden on businesses,"" Mr. Adamec said.
\
Legislators are holding back on new taxes as the state and county deal with rising job losses.
\
According to the latest figures from the state Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, the county's unemployment rate stands at 4.5 percent as of November 2008, up from 3.9 percent in September.
\
With job losses spiking, the state needs to be careful of placing any additional burden on businesses, said Sushant Sidh, principal of Capitol Strategies, an Annapolis lobbying group whose clients include Erickson Retirement Communities and Verizon.
\
""If it costs more money, it's going to cost more money to retain jobs,"" he said. ""We have to protect jobs now, first and foremost.""
\
Bob Burdon, president and chief executive officer of the Annapolis and Anne Arundel County Chamber of Commerce, said he senses a cooperative spirit between the public and private sector this year.
\
""Taxes are pretty much going to be off the table,"" he said. ""That's critical for both us and businesses. We depend on consumer activity for our livelihood.""
\
Forming an agenda
\
Although taxes may be off the table, now is not the time to sit back and relax, Mr. Burdon said, adding that there still will be an ""element of vigilance"" this session. Even as talk of raising the state gas tax increases, Mr. Burdon said the chamber would probably not support the measure. ""Trying to increase any tax is just not a good idea,"" he said.
\
Meanwhile, the chamber has outlined its agenda for the 2009 General Assembly session that includes promoting tourism, a balanced tax and regulatory environment and access to affordable health insurance, among other issues.
\
The chamber advocates expanding the commercial sector percentage of the assessable tax base in Anne Arundel from 17 percent to 23 percent, Mr. Burdon said. ""It goes right to the heart of land use,"" he said. ""You want to encourage businesses not only to relocate here but also expand here.""
\
He said the chamber also supports putting sunsets on any mandates so the General Assembly can come back and review the mandates again.
\
""They should be reviewed periodically,"" he said. ""As time goes on, needs change.""
\
The chamber is also taking a firm stance to support a Senate bill filed last week called the Anne Arundel County Tourism and Economic Development Promotion Act of 2009.
\
Sponsored by Mr. Astle, the bill would mandate that the Annapolis and Anne Arundel County Conference and Visitors Bureau receive 25 percent of the county's share of hotel tax revenue, up from the 7 percent it has in the past.
\
The Anne Arundel Economic Development Corp. would receive a 7 percent share of the hotel tax revenue.
\
Mr. Burdon said providing a dedicated source of funding for the two agencies is crucial. The agencies were created under former County Executive Robert Neall to help pull Anne Arundel out of an economic downturn in the 1990s, he said.
\
""Those two entities proved their worth during that time,"" he said.
\
Mr. Astle said the bill will help the area stay competitive and provide much-needed marketing dollars. Annapolis and Anne Arundel are already in competition with other states, he said, noting that New Jersey is advertising with signs in Prince George's County.
\
""Even in a time of downturn, people still have discretionary money and they want to do some traveling,"" he said. ""If we can get this money to market, hopefully we're going to be filling up Annapolis and Anne Arundel County with visitors who are going to be spending money."" {Corrections:} {Status:}

LEGISLATORS DON'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH INTEREST IN ADDING ANY FEES
"
207,"Maryland senators peppered the governor's acting transportation secretary with so many questions Monday night that his confirmation hearing will be delayed for a week.\A Senate panel voted to bring back Pete K. Rahn for another round next Monday, and in the process held up the nominations of four other Cabinet members put forward by Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. \For twice as long as any other Hogan nominee, senators quizzed Rahn on his background and plans for the agency and its high-profile mass transit projects. They even questioned the way Hogan introduced him a month ago, as the ""best highway builder in the entire country."" \Rahn assured them the title did not define him. \""I'm not just a highway guy. I'm a transportation guy,"" Rahn said. \Rahn's nomination comes at a time when Hogan has proposed shifting more money to highways and ending automatic increases to the gas tax, a move that Democrats say could threaten several billion dollars in transportation projects in the pipeline. \Hogan is opposed to tying the increases to inflation and argues elected officials should have to vote every time a tax goes up. \Prospects for Hogan's gas tax plan are slim, as top Democrats who control the legislature say they are unlikely to repeal it. \They questioned Rahn at length about his views on major projects such as the Red Line in Baltimore and the Purple Line in the Washington suburbs. Hogan has suggested the state may not be able to afford them. \Rahn told senators that ""we're trying to figure out how we can deliver these projects,"" saying he requested a review of how to build the projects for less. \Sen. Catherine E. Pugh, a Baltimore City Democrat, said she wanted to impress upon Rahn how important such projects -- particularly the Red Line -- are to the city's economic development. \Sen. Jamie Raskin, chair of the executive nominations committee, said he has received a lot of information from fans of Rahn, who served stints as a transportation secretary in New Mexico and Missouri, and from his critics. \The critics, Raskin said, cite a road project in northwestern New Mexico from 1997. Rahn helped create one of the country's first public-private partnerships and financed it with what was at the time a novel plan to borrow money against the promise of future federal funding. \The contract went to a subsidiary of Koch Industries that had never built a highway before. A clause in the warranty ultimately left the state on the hook for millions in repair costs \Rahn said afterward that he expected questions on that project. \""It was controversial because it was new,"" he said. \Lawmakers also had more questions for Ben Grumbles, Hogan's nominee for secretary of the environment, who also will return next week. Grumbles and Rahn will be joined by three other nominees: Rona Kramer for the Department of Aging, Michael Gill for the Department of Business and Economic Development, and Kenneth C. Holt for the Department of Housing and Community Development. \Hogan's spokesman Doug Mayer dismissed the significance of the delay. \ecox@baltsun.com \twitter.com/ErinatTheSun\Credit: The Baltimore Sun"
208,"Mass transit systems need to be as cost-effective as possible; there's never been much doubt about that. But to make cost-effectiveness the primary criterion by which any proposed new bus and rail systems are judged is a short-sighted and perhaps even costly mistake.\That error - committed by the transit-averse administration of President George W. Bush - was rectified last week. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood announced that the federal government is going back to a policy of looking at a broad range of factors, including a start-up project's impact on economic development, the environment and land use, when deciding whether it should be funded.\That could prove exceedingly helpful to the Baltimore area, where transit advocates are hoping construction on the east-west Red Line, the 14.5-mile light rail system from Woodlawn to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, could be started as early as 2013. Economic development is one of the project's best arguments.\But perhaps even more important, the decision should allow the Maryland Transit Administration to re-think one of the agency's more regrettable choices. In order to shave about $70 million from the Red Line's cost, planners opted last year to delete one of the tunnels originally slated to go under Cooks Lane, leaving the system with a mile-long single-track segment.\Baltimore light rail riders know full well what single-track means. When trains going in opposite directions have to take turns sharing track, the system slows down considerably, and if any problems arise on that segment - a breakdown or signal failure - there's no alternative available to re-route trains.\That's why the MTA invested so much to double-track Baltimore's existing light rail in recent years and why the Cooks Tunnel savings wouldn't produce any real savings at all. On the books, the proposal may look more cost-effective, but the MTA was probably going to have to eventually build a second tunnel anyway (no doubt at a cost well above the projected $70 million).\Of course, that doesn't mean Maryland can spend willy-nilly on the Red Line and expect it to be built. Neighborhood groups in Canton and along Edmondson Avenue want tunnels, but even with the Obama administration's policy change, they remain cost-prohibitive.\And while the Red Line may now be judged sufficiently cost-effective to qualify for funding, the route to securing that money is far from obstacle-free.\Not only is the federal government's commitment to paying for transportation in flux these days (Congress and the Obama administration have yet to devise a suitable source of revenue), but Maryland also can't afford to build much of anything without an increase in the gas tax or something equivalent to refill the state's depleted Transportation Trust Fund.\The Red Line is one of three mass transit projects Maryland needs to fund. Add together the cost of the two in the Washington region (the Purple Line from New Carrollton to Silver Spring and the Corridor Cities Transitway along I-270 to Clarksburg), and Maryland is looking to invest nearly $4 billion in transit, for which the state and federal government would split the cost 50-50.\That's a tall order, particularly at a time when political leaders have little interest in raising taxes. But failure to invest in adequate public transportation is bound to prove costly, too. While the recession has momentarily rocked Maryland's economy, traffic gridlock could be even more destructive in the long term.\Readers respond\I still think it's a terrible idea to have surface tracks on Boston Street. The Red Line should be running underneath Eastern Avenue.\Sonofboh\Even surface tracks on Fleet and/or Eastern would be a big improvement since it would significantly enlarge the population that the Red Line would serve. Let the whining NIMBYs on Boston Street miss out on the benefits.\Ichy\Eastern Avenue is a better route, overall, because the line can go straight through to Highlandtown, Greektown and Bayview. There could be a huge improvement to those areas, making them much more desirable places to live.\The major drawback is that it leaves Canton out.\Yuca"
209,"Republican Corey Stottlemyer concedes that state Sen. Ron Young was once a visionary leader who, as mayor of Frederick, helped a sleepy city become a thriving hub of business and culture.\But that's all in the past, Stottlemyer says. \""He's always talking about things he did when he was mayor of Frederick,"" says Stottlemyer, 38, an economist in his first campaign for office. \""I'm running against his four years as state senator. I see him not as the leader he once was, but as a follower. He's not pushing new ideas."" \Young, 73, says that line of argument is hogwash. He points to bills he's introduced seeking to promote zero-energy homes, ban employers and coaches from demanding social media passwords, and to require the state to keep a database of animal abusers. \""I'm running against a young guy who is trying to say I'm old and out of touch, which is garbage,"" Young says. ""It won't sell. I introduced more than 100 bills in the four years I've been there."" \Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller sent an aide to campaign with Young to see if he still had the vigor to win. Young, a former ultramarathon runner, says he jogged while door-knocking and wore the aide out. ""I still have the energy to serve the community,"" he says. \Young is perhaps the best-known politician in Frederick County, the patriarch of what's become a political dynasty: Youngs have collectively served more than 50 years in elected office, and boast four candidates this election cycle, including his son, Blaine, the Republican candidate for Frederick County executive. \The General Assembly's 3rd District, where Young is a one-term state senator, isn't a Democratic stronghold, which gives Stottlemyer and the state's Republican Party hope. Young has one of four state Senate seats the state GOP thinks are ready for a Republican takeover. (The others are held by Democrats Jim Brochin in northern Baltimore County, Roy P. Dyson in Southern Maryland and Jim Mathias on the Eastern Shore.) \Young's district has 4,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, but GOP voters are known to turn out in higher numbers there, which worries Young. And for 12 years it was represented by tea party conservative Alex Mooney, whom Young defeated in 2010. \Stottlemyer believes he can take out Young. ""I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think I had a good chance of winning,"" he says. \Young, who was mayor of Frederick for 16 years and the state's ""Smart Growth"" chief under Gov. Parris N. Glendening, says Stottlemyer is making the same mistake as Mooney in arguing that Young has grown stale. \He recalls a debate in which Mooney made an issue of his age. ""I said, 'Do you have a problem with older people?' The whole audience broke out laughing,"" Young said. ""He forgot who votes. It's the last time he brought that up."" \Stottlemyer, who was a regional director for Republican Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.'s campaign for governor in 2006, filed to run for office less than a week before the deadline. He is outgunned financially, with only $2,000 in his campaign account compared to $58,000 for Young. He acknowledges it's perhaps an uphill battle. \""It's a low-budget campaign,"" Stottlemyer says. ""There's no one who has higher name identification in Frederick County than Ron Young. I mean, let's face facts."" \But he's quickly picked up supporters -- some of whom are angered at something that Young or a family member has done. \Steven Holman, 29, and Antonio Bowens, 24, say they're supporting Stottlemyer because they believe in his approach to public life, but also because Young's wife, Karen, supported building of a third Wal-Mart in Frederick. \""We need new people and new ideas,"" says Holman. ""Corey shows an openness to look at all sides of an issue."" \Joe Parsley is so incensed that Young voted for the state gas tax increase that he posted large sign outside his Shell station pledging to vote against him. \""We need people with conservative principles who care about small businesses and hold the line on tax increases and spending,"" Parsley says. ""I think Corey is that person."" \Parsley agrees with Stottlemyer that Young's best days are behind him. ""Ron Young has been a great asset to the city in the past,"" he says. \""Right now all he is doing is rubber-stamping what [Gov. Martin] O'Malley, Miller and the leadership in Annapolis are putting out. He's not looking out for local Frederick. He wouldn't have voted for this gas tax if he was."" \Young defends his vote in favor of the tax increase, saying the funds are needed for transportation improvements. \""When I was mayor, I cut the tax rate seven times,"" he says. ""In the General Assembly, if you vote against the budget, you don't get anything to bring back to your district. I want to bring things back to my community."" \He says he still has unfinished business in the Senate. \""Unlike what they're trying to picture me, I've been very independent,"" Young says. \He also says he has voted for what he believes is right, even if some in his district may not have agreed with his position. ""I stood up for things ... like same-sex marriage and the Dream Act,"" which allows some immigrants in the country illegally to pay in-state college tuition rates. ""I would rather be right with history,"" he said. \He points to his support for Frederick's zero-energy homes -- houses that generate as much solar electricity as they use -- as an idea he wants to encourage throughout the state. \Jamie Shopland, the president of the Young Democrats of Frederick County, says it's ideas like those that make Young as relevant in Maryland politics as ever. \""Senator Young is the only candidate in the race who has a long record of standing for issues that young people care about including protecting social media privacy, funding our public education system, and finding incentives to protect our environment like zero-waste-energy housing,"" she says. \lbroadwater@baltsun.com \twitter.com/lukebroadwater \Ronald N.

210,"Democratic leaders in Annapolis have compiled a ""to do"" list for the next three months that includes raising taxes and changing the definition of marriage. Some also want to close off big chunks of Maryland to development and open even more casinos in the state.\Any one of these proposals would be off-putting to many lawmakers in most years -- indeed, some ideas have been passed along like a plate of limp vegetables from one session to the next. But during the 90-day session that begins Wednesday, pressure from many different directions is expected to spur the governor and General Assembly to take action. \To borrow from the late Gov. William Donald Schaefer, it is likely to be a Do it Now! legislative session. \Reasons for that vary but include the lackluster economy, quirks to the electoral calendar and, some suggest, Gov. Martin O'Malley's national political ambitions. \O'Malley has said this is the year for a massive public works program to create jobs -- particularly construction positions. The state's employment picture improved in the past three months, but economists still predict that 2012 job growth could be ""anemic."" \Leaders are looking to the state's backlog of transportation and school construction projects to in effect provide a jobs program. Paying for it is expected to involve raising the state's 23.5-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline. It has been unchanged since 1992. \The proposal could bring to the table allies who normally wouldn't be on the side of a governor seeking to raise revenue. Leading business groups such as the Maryland Chamber of Commerce and Greater Baltimore Committee have long argued that the state needs to raise and spend more money to meet its transportation needs and reduce congestion. \The governor has support from the General Assembly's presiding officers. ""I'm going to pass a tax increase,"" Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller said in an interview. ""It doesn't poll well, but leaders lead and it's one of the ways we're going to put people back to work."" \House Speaker Michael E. Busch called raising the gas tax a ""tough initiative,"" but said he also wants an aggressive capital plan that would put Marylanders to work. \""The question is,"" Busch said, ""is there another revenue source that can replace that? Anything we can do to get people to work in the construction trades will be very helpful."" \Lawmakers know they can take advantage of 2012 as a sweet spot of the four-year election cycle: The newly elected rank and file became acquainted with each other during their first session last year and are more comfortable now. They may feel the odds are good that they can take unpopular positions and voters will forgive (or forget) by 2014 when senators and delegates are on the ballot again. \This year, ""there is more of a probability that taxes will be increased,"" said Roy Meyers, a political science professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. There will be ""less interest"" for raising taxes as one gets any closer to the next election. \The state is about $400 million short for needed upgrades to 67 sewage plants, creating what Democratic leaders are calling an urgent need to increase the $30 annual ""flush tax"" -- an annual fee that is added to household water bills to pay for cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay. \Del. Maggie McIntosh, the Baltimore Democrat who chairs the House Environmental Matters Committee, predicts an increase in the fee will be approved. Over the summer, she led a panel of 28 ""stakeholders"" including developers, environmentalists, and state and county planners to examine how Maryland would meet clean water mandates. The group recommended raising the flush tax to $90 over three years. \""That has provided us a blueprint for meeting our water quality goals that have been set by EPA,"" McIntosh said. If the General Assembly doesn't raise the fee, McIntosh signaled, she's prepared to send the unpaid bill to local governments. \Another revenue generator that some leaders want addressed now is gambling. Miller says the state just isn't getting enough money from its current slots casinos, and he wants to see an expansion. Such a change would have to be approved by voters, so supporters need to do it now to get it on the 2012 ballot -- or wait for 2014. \Miller would like to see the state allow a sixth gambling casino and wants it to go in his native Prince George's County. He has suggested Rosecroft Raceway or the National Harbor development as two possible sites. Such a change could bring in more revenue to the state, but would encounter resistance from current license holders worried about losing market share. \The Senate president referred to the state's casino owners as ""entrepreneurs"" and offered them two carrots: a reduction in the 67 percent state tax rate on their revenue and a change in law to permit table games like poker, baccarat and blackjack. ""Hopefully we'll come up with a comprehensive bill,"" Miller said. \Busch, however, dismissed expanding gambling to another site as a ""fringe issue"" in the session and predicted that his chamber would not focus on it. \Also tied to the election calendar is same-sex marriage. Leaders want to pass it now or shelve it until the next four-year term, which starts in 2015. The reason: The item is so contentious that lawmakers assume it will be petitioned to referendum. They would rather that happen in 2012 and not in 2014 when they're up for re-election. \Governor O'Malley's agenda is expected to include a suite of liberal policies on the environment, including two proposals that failed last year and were reworked over the summer: curbing the use of septic systems and creating an off-shore wind farm. \""We had a dry run, if you will,"" Richard Hall, the state planning secretary,said of the initial septic system bill. Lawmakers rejected O'Malley's sweeping proposal to ban septics for virtually all new developments, saying it would effectively halt growth in rural areas. Requiring new projects to have public sewer systems makes them prohibitively expensive, critics said. \Over the summer a task force including lawmakers came up with a more nuanced approach that would split the state into four zones, with some rural areas carrying more stringent restrictions on septics than others. Proponents say the time is right to make a decision, as critics have had their say. \O'Malley has also signaled that he'll make another push this year for an off-shore wind farm in waters near Ocean City. The governor wants to move quickly on wind so Maryland will be in the vanguard of a new industry. He envisions Maryland-based manufacturing jobs one day creating parts for wind farms up and down the East Coast. \Republicans have a different take on the governor's motives. They say the aggressive environmental agenda is part of a broader plan to bolster O'Malley's standing nationally among progressives and to make him a more attractive candidate for president in a 2016 Democratic primary. \""This is about national policy,"" said state Senate Minority Leader E.J. Pipkin. ""The citizens will be paying his taxes when he is running for national office. Some of us are not going to let that happen."" \Pipkin, who represents the Upper Eastern Shore, argues O'Malley wants to show liberal opinion leaders across the country that he can pass a state version of their national agenda, getting a Maryland gas tax increase where Democrats in Congress could not, demonstrating ""green"" credentials by building an off-shore wind farm, and stimulating the economy with public works. \Some Democrats point out that expecting action on leading initiatives for 2012 does not necessarily mean passage. Asking the rank-and-file to make tough vote after tough vote will not be easy. \""How many times can you go to the well to lean on people?"" asked Del. Dereck Davis, a Prince George's Democrat and chairman of the House Economic Matters Committee. "" 'I need you for gay marriage,' 'I need you for wind.' \""It will be a phenomenal accomplishment on O'Malley's part if he is even able to get half of it done,"" Davis said. \annie.linskey@baltsun.com \twitter.com/annielinskey \michael.dresser@baltsun.com \twitter.com/michaeltdresser \Agenda for General Assembly session \ASSEMBLY Gas tax A blue-ribbon commission recommended a 15-cent increase to the gas tax, which has not been raised since 1992. Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller has said he'd be more comfortable with a 10-cent increase. \Economic stimulus Gov. Martin O'Malley, House Speaker Michael E. Busch and Miller have all talked about spurring the state's construction industry with a larger-than-usual capital budget. A gas tax increase could pay for some of these projects. \Same-sex marriage O'Malley said he will make legalizing gay nuptials part of his legislative agenda this year. The bill passed in the Senate last year but was pulled from the House floor after a lengthy debate. Maryland would be the seventh state to allow single-sex marriages. Washington, D.C., also allows them. \'Flush tax' A commission on water quality recommended tripling the $30 annual fee Marylanders pay on their water bill. The money would largely go toward upgrades at sewage treatment plants. \Limiting septic systems O'Malley wants to curb sprawl and pollution into the Chesapeake Bay by making parts of the state off-limits for septic systems. The governor wanted a near ban last year, but has come up with a less sweeping approach this session. \Off-shore wind O'Malley has suggested he will propose a new framework to bring off-shore wind power to Maryland. The program would copy incentives for the solar industry and require utilities to provide a set amount of energy created by turbines. \Gambling expansion Proposals include expanding gambling options to include table games and adding a new casino in Prince George's County. \Legislative redistricting On the 45th day of the session, late in February, the governor's proposed map for new General Assembly districts becomes law if neither chamber fiddles with it. Though the draft plan has left some members feeling sour, there's little chance that O'Malley's plan will be rewritten."
211,"Commuter bus riders in Columbia say they feel as if they have been sucker-punched.\Initially heartened by an O'Malley administration that promotes mass transit, many who spoke at a public hearing last week say they were blindsided by the state's plan to eliminate service to Baltimore and trim other routes in Howard County, starting Jan. 12.\Ridership has spiked on the imperiled Routes 310 and 311, and commuters say they feel that by using mass transit, they are doing exactly what Gov. Martin O'Malley has urged to help the environment, reduce congestion and save gas. Others say they have no alternatives and could be forced to leave jobs or drop out of classes at Howard Community College.\""I feel that somebody took the map of Howard County and put Wite-Out over Columbia, as if we don't exist,"" Arlysse Furlow of Columbia said during a Mass Transit Administration hearing Tuesday. ""We vote. We really vote.""\About 200 people packed Owen Brown Interfaith Center.\""If we can have gambling, why not a transit system?"" Regina Bellina of Hanover asked examiner Simon Taylor.\County transportation planners say that up to 600 residents could lose bus service if the reductions go through. Because of lower gas tax and vehicle titling revenues, the MTA is proposing eliminating the two routes that connect Baltimore and Columbia, and the 320 route that serves the U.S. 1 corridor to Laurel. Other cuts would affect MARC train service and eliminate seven trips on bus route 929 and one trip on route 995 to Washington. No service would be offered on holidays, including the days after Thanksgiving and Christmas.\The only remaining bus to Baltimore would leave from Long Gate Shopping Center in Ellicott City, and commuters said those vehicles are already nearly full.\Route 310 has an average of 235 passengers a day, a nearly 54 percent increase since last year. Route 311 has had a 42 percent increase to 219 passengers a day, according to state figures.\Most speakers said they would voluntarily pay higher fares, though an MTA handout said that option was rejected because of the national economic woes. Fares now cover only 40 percent of the cost of the service.\County Council member Mary Kay Sigaty, a west Columbia Democrat, suggested ""looking at an increase in the gas tax,"" which has not been raised in 15 years, as a way of bolstering faltering state revenue dedicated to transportation. She said her fellow Democratic elected officials urged her not to bring that up.\Three members of the House of Delegates, two state senators from Howard and another council member came to the hearing to express strong opposition to the proposed service cuts. County Executive Ken Ulman appeared later to reinforce the message.\Ulman and others noted that the county acted quickly six months ago after the summer gas price spike, adding 30 parking places at the crowded Snowden River Parkway park-and-ride lot at Route 175, only to be faced with losing service.\""I thought it was a great example of government doing what it should be doing,"" Ulman said. ""This really struck me very hard.""\Del. Frank S. Turner said he would play ""bad cop"" to Ulman's ""good cop,"" by subtly threatening the MTA and O'Malley.\""Our delegation has a lot of members on appropriation committees and in leadership roles,"" he said. ""There is another way.""\Some of the strongest appeals voiced Tuesday came from riders who said they have no options.\Mona G. Tsoukleris of Clarksville, an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy in Baltimore, said she has retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease that prevents her from driving.\""I first reacted to this with shock, then with anger, and then disbelief and fear,"" she said, her voice quavering. ""I'm very emotional about this.""\Tsoukleris said she works up to 70 hours a week and has no other way to get to her job.\""I'm looking at forced retirement in January,"" she said. ""I'm begging, let me keep working.""\Others said they work at Johns Hopkins Hospital in East Baltimore, the Veterans Administration downtown and other places where parking a car is expensive and difficult.\John Hill said he moved from Columbia to Washington two years ago to care for his elderly father and rides to Columbia daily for work. He said he would have to quit his job if routes are cut as planned on several Washington runs.\Jean Ryan of Silver Spring said she rides to Baltimore's VA hospital. She said she has lived in three other countries that have superb transit systems and hoped things were beginning to change in the United States.\""Don't cut back. Add,"" she said. ""We need to figure out a new way to fund the MTA.""\Bev Thomas suggested that Johns Hopkins might help subsidize the bus from Columbia, and others thought that private firms might step in if the state bows out.\Katherine Donahue, a student at Howard Community College, said reducing runs on Route 995 to Columbia would end her college experience because she has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and can't drive.\""If this is cut, it would be devastating to me,"" she said.\Opposition also came from the League of Women Voters, the Howard County Citizens Association and Transportation Advocates, a private group in the county.\The state is accepting additional written comments through Dec. 26. Comments should be sent to Glenn Litsinger, MTA Office of Consumer Information, 6 St. Paul St., Baltimore. E-mail comments would be sent to commuterbus@mtamaryland.com or marc@maryland.com with ""Hearing comments"" as the subject heading.\proposed cuts\MTA bus routes:\* Eliminate Routes 310, 311 and 320.\* Eliminate five weekday trips on Route 929 to Washington and two more from Columbia to Silver Spring on Saturdays\* Eliminate one round-trip on Route 995 from Clarksville and Ellicott City to Columbia and Washington, including the stop at Oakland Mills Village Center.\MARC train service:\* Eliminate two night trips each way on the Penn line, leaving Baltimore at 8:40 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. and leaving Washington at 10:05 p.m. and 11 p.m.\Credit: larry.carson@baltsun.com"

Gas taxes
\
I have to laugh at this, because if I don't, it will just make me angry.
\
The gas tax goes for transportation projects? What projects?
\
We all still fight traffic every day. I can only assume that the money is not going to the roads.
\
Interstate 695 has been under construction for as long as I have been driving. Our roads are a mess. What we need is for our government to stop wasting money.
\
I don't think any of those in government are doing enough for the public on electric rates, gas prices and our huge property taxes.
\
Maryland is eventually going to be for only wealthy people. But our government officials sit in their cushy homes, drive their expensive cars, and have a great retirement package and great health insurance.

Gas prices
\
An article (The Capital, April 27) had a few interesting points made by two of our officials concerning the high gas prices.
\
Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., the story said, ""is considering a temporary cut in the gas tax as a way to soften the blow of the rising gas prices."" That sounds as if the governor is accepting that rising gas prices will happen and nothing can change them, thus giving the public no hope of a change.
\
This type of leadership scares me. How about you?
\
Putting a Band-Aid on the gas problem does not end the financial burden on the public in the long run, but may allow some of the public to believe that steps are being taken and efforts are being made.
\
More interesting was a statement from state Attorney General J. Joseph Curran. He told the public he would keep an eye on gasoline price and is responding to complaints from the citizens, but there is little he can do because Maryland does not have a law against price-gouging.
\
We are already doing the job of keeping an eye on gasoline prices, and we are not getting a salary for it.
\
Our representatives should do what is necessary to make a law. The laws Maryland currently has did not always exist either. They were made because someone stood up to a problem, addressed it in the proper forum, submitted the necessary paper to the right department of government, and then had it voted on by our representatives.
\
Many laws have been made and continue to be made to protect the general public, and a law against gasoline price-gouging is necessary and needs to be made now.

Stop for buses
\
It was the closest call yet!
\
At 6:30 a.m. on March 24, school bus No. 48, which was going south, stopped - with its red lights flashing - at Birdsville Road (Route 424) at Dodon Road.
\
Just as children were poised to cross, a small dark car going north screeched to a stop a couple feet from the front of the bus. Worse yet, a white panel truck with ladders on top swerved around the car on the shoulder. Then the car and the truck sped by the bus.
\
Please, does anyone care? Does anyone have suggestions as to what to do before children are mowed down?
\
Once, when I drove my granddaughter to school, I wondered why so many chose to drive. Now I see that it would be safer than getting on a school bus.
\
All day, every day, drivers fly around the curve at Dodon. But at least when we are pulling out in our cars, we have a fighting chance. Our children don't.

'Caged Bird'
\
I was required in the seventh-grade to read Maya Angelou's ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."" This marvelous book stretched my mind compassionately beyond my comfortable ""caged bird"" surroundings to the realities of grinding poverty and rampant racism.
\
Yes, the rape scenes upset me. But this is an opportunity to discuss in controlled environments - the classroom and parent-child conversation - the fact that some people do horrible things, and silence does not protect victims or prevent atrocities.
\
Would you keep your teens from reading ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" to hide from them the reality of the Holocaust and other genocides?
\
Also, parents and teachers can keep alive their feeling of hope by pointing to the brilliant, accomplished, open-hearted woman Ms. Angelou has become.
\
As to becoming ""excited"" by the rape of a frightened little girl: That's just sick.

Censure Bush

U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., is right in calling for the censure of President Bush. Mr. Bush has clearly violated the law by ordering wiretaps of U.S. citizens without warrants.
\
Anyone who is unclear about this only needs to go read the law. It couldn't be clearer - President Bush broke the law.
\

"
213,"With Democratic lawmakers in Maryland largely unaffected by the Republican tide that swept the rest of the country, and no one facing re-election for another four years, the General Assembly is looking forward to a busy legislative session.\Gov. Martin O'Malley and the legislature will spend much of the 90-day session that begins Wednesday in Annapolis grappling with the $13 billion state operating budget - and the $1.6 billion gap in it.\But they'll also take up hundreds of policy issues, some of them so contentious that they could end up on the ballot during next year's presidential election.\Stalling revenues and a growing deficit are prompting talk of raising taxes. Maryland lawmakers will consider a range of legislation on immigration, from an Arizona-style crackdown to offers of in-state tuition for students without papers. The prospects for legal recognition of gay marriage appear to have improved. And with just two of five approved slots locations open, legislators are likely to tweak the state's gambling program.\The gas tax\Maryland hasn't raised its 23.5 cents-per-gallon gas tax in nearly two decades. The state Transportation Trust Fund, which the tariff supports, is dwindling.\Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller is among the leaders in Annapolis who support raising the gas tax. Opposition is expected from Republicans, and the question of what to do with the new revenue could provoke fights even among supporters.\Miller and other Democratic legislators say a gas tax increase would enable them to stop diverting money from the general sales tax to the transportation fund. Greater Baltimore Committee President Donald C. Fry described such a move as ""just a behind-the-door way of adding more money to the general fund.""\But Del. Sheila E. Hixson, chairwoman of the Ways and Means Committee, hinted that a gas increase would go toward day-to-day state operations.\""As we have in the past, we can borrow from the Transportation Trust Fund,"" the Montgomery County Democrat said.\Slots\More than two years after Maryland voters passed a measure legalizing slot-machine gambling, three of the state's five approved casino locations remain undeveloped, and lawmakers are expected to review proposals to make the program more enticing to developers.\Some gambling revenue is designated to prop up the state's beleaguered horse racing industry - which also could be the subject of legislation this year.\Orioles owner Peter G. Angelos has revealed a bid to buy the closed Rosecroft racetrack in Prince George's County in a proposal that includes putting slots there.\When slots-enabling legislation passed in 2007, Prince George's leaders objected to gambling, so none of the five state sites is located in the county. Miller, who represents part of Prince George's, expects the state Senate to back new slots locations and hopes local leaders will be receptive.\""When they see these budget cuts and no tax increases, I hope people would be broad-minded enough to realize that change is important,"" he said.\Voters would get the final say.\Other possible fixes include allowing more entertainment and dining options at the casinos, and reducing the state's 67 percent take of slots profits to attract bids for the licenses in Baltimore and at Rocky Gap in Western Maryland, sites that have failed to attract qualified bidders.\And a plan to legalize table games, debated last year, could be raised again.\""People are going to want to push for full gaming,"" said House Speaker Michael E. Busch, an Anne Arundel Democrat. ""There's a lot on the table when it comes to gaming.""\Gay marriage\The future looks a shade brighter for same-sex couples who want to be married in Maryland. Democratic gains in the state Senate, and the election calendar, give sympathetic (but nervous) lawmakers reason to push for gay marriage sooner rather than later.\The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee has gained two votes in favor of gay marriage, changing a key dynamic, according to Morgan Meneses-Sheets, executive director of the gay-rights group Equality Maryland.\""We've been stuck in the Senate committee,"" she said. Senate Minority Leader Allan H. Kittleman, a Howard County Republican, is trying to broker a compromise, saying that he'll introduce a bill to allow civil unions.\Miller opposes gay marriage but said he would oppose any attempt to filibuster the issue if it gets to the Senate floor.\While the Senate moved to the left after the November elections, the House of Delegates added six Republican members. By Meneses-Sheets' count, the new House committee assignments leave gay-marriage advocates one vote short of passage.\""We're in a position where we're fighting for those last few votes,"" she said.\Opponents of gay marriage say the numbers don't add up for passage in either chamber.\""It is so hard to predict how people in the end are going to vote,"" said Mary Ellen Russell, executive director of the Maryland Catholic Conference. ""Undoing an institution that has been the foundation of our society is something people will think long and hard about doing.""\The Assembly probably would not have the last word on the issue: A bill that passes this year or the next would be tossed to the electorate as a ballot initiative in 2012. President Barack Obama will likely be on the ballot then, along with Maryland's congressional delegation, but state lawmakers do not have to worry about re-election until 2014.\Vulnerable members in the Democratic-heavy body would prefer not to share a ballot with an issue that, in other states, has driven up conservative turnout. Or, as Busch put it: ""The legislature will be less enthusiastic about putting something on the ballot if they are up for re-election.""\Immigration\With a decade's worth of congressional efforts to overhaul immigration having ground to a halt, state legislatures across the country are attempting to take matters into their own hands.\In Maryland, Del. Patrick L. McDonough, a Baltimore County Republican, has promised 16 bills that would crack down on illegal immigrants. At the other end of the debate, Sen.-elect Victor Ramirez, a Prince George's County Democrat, is drafting legislation that would help immigrants receive in-state tuition. Miller said the proposal might be limited to community colleges.\One of McDonough's measures would explicitly prohibit colleges from giving in-state tuition to immigrants. Another measure would require proof of citizenship to vote. All of the proposals, McDonough said, have been approved in other states.\""What's important to me is the rule of law, the citizenship we have and its value,"" McDonough said. ""This is a sanctuary state, and it's getting worse.""\Alcohol tax\In previous sessions, lobbyist Vincent DeMarco has led a group of disabled people around the state capital pushing for a dime-a-drink tax on alcoholic beverages that would benefit their health care. The General Assembly last increased the tax on wine in 1972; the levy on distilled spirits hasn't risen since 1955.\The tax portion of the concept is gaining momentum, but it is unclear that the disabled would benefit.\Miller said DeMarco ""needs to be realistic"" about where revenue from a higher levy on alcohol taxes would go. ""If we raise it, it'll be because it's the right thing to do,"" Miller said.\In the House, Hixson said she's interested in raising the tax, but when asked whether the revenue would be dedicated to the disabled, she said: ""We will not be doing that.""\An increase in the tax on alcohol could add $207 million to the general fund, according to a legislative analysis.\The state's alcohol lobby contends that the sour economy is already hurting bars and liquor stores. They view the idea as a tax on the sort of struggling small businesses that O'Malley has pledged to protect.\Wine shipping\Lovers of hard-to-find wines are already toasting the 2011 session, because House and Senate leaders say they are likely to pass legislation allowing wine to be sold by mail in Maryland.\But there is a dispute brewing over who would be allowed to ship wine into the state. Many agree that vineyards should be permitted to mail cases of wine, but the alcohol lobby wants to draw the line there and prohibit liquor stores from mailing. Such an arrangement would keep many wine-of-the-month clubs beyond the reach of Marylanders.\""I think there will probably be a bill,"" said Sen. Joan Carter Conway, the Baltimore Democrat who chairs the Senate committee that oversees the issue. ""Will it be the bill [advocates] want? We do want to accommodate the constituents. ... We don't want to put the retailers in Maryland out of business.""\Conway was far less enthusiastic about changing the state's corkage rules to allow Marylanders to take their own wine to more restaurants.\""That is crazy,"" she said. ""It doesn't make sense to me.""\Drunken or distracted driving\Heading the list of transportation-related issues expected to come before the legislature is a proposal to require those convicted of drunken driving to install devices to prevent them from starting their vehicles if they have consumed alcohol.\MADD Maryland and other advocates vow to renew a struggle that went down to the final hours of the 2010 legislative session before a bill that would have made the so-called ignition interlock devices mandatory for even first-time offenders died in the House Judiciary Committee.\While the issue is returning, so is the lawmaker most responsible for the legislation's demise last year. Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph F. Vallario Jr. pushed for a compromise that would have required interlock devices for first-time offenders only if they were found to have a blood-alcohol level higher than the legal limit of .08 percent, but could not persuade MADD to go along.\MADD appears no more interested in cutting a deal this year.\""Not all compromise is progress,"" said Caroline Cash, executive director of MADD Maryland.\Cash said advocates could seek to use the issue of interlock devices to address what they see as a weakness in drunken-driving laws: the ability of suspects to refuse to be tested. She said advocates might propose to make ignition interlock installation mandatory for those who refuse tests.\Lawmakers could also tighten rules restricting the use of cell phones and other electronic devices while behind the wheel. Del. James E. Malone Jr., the Baltimore County Democrat who chairs the House subcommittee on highway safety, said legislators will seek to close a loophole in the state's texting-while-driving ban that allows motorists to read messages.\He said the committee might also consider whether the cell phone ban adopted last year as a secondary offense - which is insufficient in itself to trigger a traffic stop - should be made a primary offense.\But Robert McKinney, president of the Maryland Highway Safety Foundation, which pushed for the cell phone measure, said the organization is leaning toward waiting another year to give Marylanders time to get used to the law.\Energy\Look for sparks over offshore wind energy and Marcellus shale gas drilling. Environmentalists hope to boost prospects for wind turbines off Maryland's coast by requiring utilities to agree to buy electricity from them. State law requires utilities to get 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2022, and the O'Malley administration has made developing offshore wind a priority.\But securing financing for such costly projects is a major hurdle, so advocates want the General Assembly to require utilities to guarantee offshore wind power a market by signing 25-year contracts to buy 3 percent of their electricity from the turbines. Labor leaders are expected to join environmentalists in this push, pointing to state estimates that a one-gigawatt project could support up to 4,000 manufacturing and construction jobs while being built, with 800 permanent jobs needed to run the facility.\Hundreds of property owners in Allegany and Garrett counties have signed leases to allow drilling for natural gas in shale deposits on their land for a share of whatever fuel is found. The state Department of the Environment has been considering a request to drill for shale gas in Garrett County for more than a year, and more requests are likely if state regulators give it a green light.\Del. Heather Mizeur, a Montgomery County Democrat, has vowed to seek a legislative moratorium on drilling until state regulations are strengthened to prevent exploration for gas from polluting streams and contaminating residents' wells, as has been alleged in other states. Western Maryland legislators have signaled that they'll oppose such a move.\Chesapeake Bay\Efforts to accelerate cleanup of the bay are likely to be handicapped this year by the state budget crisis, but some lawmakers hope to reduce pollution by limiting homeowners' use of fertilizer.\Lawn services are regulated to reduce runoff, and the nutrient content of fertilizer sold in home-and-garden stores has been slashed through voluntary agreement with the industry. But proponents say there is room for further reductions by spelling out when and how fertilizer can be applied by individuals - barring application when it's raining or during late fall, for instance.\Environmentalists, who could receive support from unlikely allies in the building industry, also plan to renew efforts to make Maryland's communities deal with their runoff. Advocates intend to revive a bill that died last year that would require all Maryland counties and municipalities to raise funds for retrofitting storm drains, installing rain gardens and other measures to capture and filter rainwater that flushes pollution into streams and, ultimately, the bay.\All of the state's localities have the authority to levy storm-water pollution fees, but only a few do. The costs of retrofitting storm drains and reducing runoff in communities statewide is estimated at $10 billion to $20 billion. The O'Malley administration did not support the bill last year, and it died in the Senate amid opposition from local officials. The administration has indicated it would support mandating storm-water fees in a year or two if localities fail to act to fund pollution-control measures.\Pensions\Scaling back the state's ballooning pension costs is among O'Malley's priorities. He hasn't said how he will do it, but he has taken some options off the table.\He opposes the idea of creating a 401(k)-style retirement arrangement. ""Rather than privatize the system, I think we have to make a sustainable defined benefit for the long term,"" O'Malley said.\He also won't propose shifting the costs of teacher pensions to local governments - at least this year. That announcement won him a standing ovation from anxious local leaders at a pre-session meeting with the Maryland Association of Counties, but he could just be delaying the pain: He said he wants to tackle systematic changes before having a ""conversation"" about making a shift.\A pension sustainability commission chaired by Democratic former House Speaker Casper R. Taylor Jr. has proposed several ideas: increasing the number of years before an employee becomes eligible for a pension and health care; pegging cost-of-living increases to investment returns rather than inflation; and reducing other benefits.\Patrick Moran, director of the Maryland chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, has vowed to fight ""tooth and nail"" against any proposed changes to the package of benefits for retired state workers.\The state teachers union is pushing the idea of delaying - Annapolis-speak for killing - wholesale changes to the plan. David Helfman, executive director of the Maryland State Education Association, called the pension commission's work ""offensive"" and ""rushed."" He said lawmakers who support reducing benefits would hear ""loud and clear"" from his members.\Campaign finance\Fresh from the November elections, a group of lawmakers and election lawyers convened by Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler is proposing 25 changes to the state's campaign finance rules.\The panel is calling for tighter state regulations on giving by political slates and limited-liability corporations, two-oft criticized ways employed by donors to circumvent the intent of contribution limits.\Members of political slates may transfer unlimited amounts of money to one another. The so-called LLC loophole enables donors to evade limits by giving through multiple limited-liability corporations.\Gansler's panel is also recommending that lawmakers take a look at the limits of $4,000 per candidate per election cycle and $10,000 per donor per cycle, which have remained unchanged since 1991.\Busch has said he believes legislators will make another run at campaign finance reform in the coming session. But both Busch and Miller have been cool to Gansler's panel because they were not consulted about which lawmakers to include.\Baltimore Sun reporters Michael Dresser and Timothy B. Wheeler contributed to this article.\Other issues on the agenda\Health exchange: Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown will lead O'Malley administration efforts to create a framework for a health insurance exchange, a step necessary before the federal health care overhaul can be carried out in the state.\Abortion: The recent high-profile case of New Jersey Dr. Steven C. Brigham performing illegal abortions in Maryland opens the door for tighter regulations. Also, the arrival of Dr. LeRoy H. Carhart, a specialist in late-term abortions, sparked outrage from abortion opponents.\Charter schools: Look for efforts to make it easier to open charter schools, including erasing a requirement that local school boards sign off on their creation charters.\Invest Maryland: O'Malley will push a bill to create a $100 million venture capital fund for investment in high-tech and biotech companies. The money would come from insurance companies paying taxes in advance at a discount.\Redistricting: Busch and Miller say the task of redrawing the state's eight congressional and 188 legislative districts based on the 2010 Census will wait until after the session. They expect a brief special session next summer.\Credit: The Baltimore Sun"

\
Your readers would benefit from the knowledge that there is an alternative to displaying a roadside memorial on public roads or rights of way. The Internet-based National Memorial Registry (www.NationalMemorialRegistry.com) offers the opportunity for any individual to dedicate a memorial location to a loved one, free of any charge.
\
Many individuals need to experience the grieving process through the display of a roadside memorial. All too often, local jurisdictions are regulating this practice.
\
Some are limiting the time a memorial can be displayed. Others are banning them. Some jurisdictions have regulations regarding the placement of memorials, but local enforcement is not done - often by choice, to help the grieving family.
\
This same Web site has a database on many states, cities and countries regarding their current and past positions - and, if available, current legislation - on the placement of roadside memorials.

Crownsville site
\
We have been aware that something would be done to the site of the former Crownsville Hospital Center.
\
We were confident that wisdom would prevail. We were confident that the missions accomplished by the nonprofit organizations that use the site would play an important part in the decisions of both the county and the state. Meeting the needs of the most needy is surely an important part of government.
\
It is truly a windfall when citizens step up to the plate to fill the gap. It certainly is obvious that this saves tax dollars as well as providing extremely important services to the community. These services bring back to the community persons who are then able to be taxpaying and responsible citizens.
\
The nonprofits do not occupy all of the site. Isn't it possible to allow them to use their small portion of the hospital land? The nonprofits would be a wise investment for the taxpaying public.

Annapolis Roads
\
I find somewhat amusing the amount of money the Annapolis Roads homeowners' association has spent to ""save the woods."" Yet it remains a powerless HOA, unable to enforce or draw up rules or regulations to fight the blighting of properties in its own community.
\
It has been written up multiple times in your newspaper for its fights with developers and churches. Yet there is no mention about the multiple blighted properties and the frustrated residents who can only turn to the county for possible help, and then wait out the process.
\
I'm the first to admit I don't want to live in a community under the iron fist of an HOA. And I did vote to fight a huge development that would have changed the landscape of the neighborhood.
\
However, when your taxes go up 110 percent in three years, you would expect an HOA that spends over $3 million on saving trees to at least do something to keep vehicles off the middle of lawns. It could also prevent broken boats and unusable campers from occupying back yards, and keep the general condition of houses from deteriorating to the point that housing values are brought down.
\
I wish the Annapolis Roads HOA spent more time trying to clean up its neighborhood internally, rather than finding new groupings of trees to spend millions on.

Hope House
\
I am one of many patients in a wonderful community here at Hope House, a nonprofit rehabilitation center in Crownsville.
\
We are trying to recover from addiction, a disease that is plaguing humanity. Hope House is an amazing place with a knowledgeable and inspiring staff.
\
Hope House is in crisis, though. It needs funding.
\
As indicated by its name, Hope House offers hope to those who don't have the money to exit a life full of despair.
\
I have been in other treatment programs when I was younger. They were like country clubs. Hope House isn't fancy, but its program and professional staff are among the finest in the field. Treatment isn't about what you spend. It is about what you receive.
\
God has shone his light on me at Hope House. If you could see fit to shed a ray of light on this extraordinary place, maybe the doors could stay open for the suffering souls still out there.

Whither Jones?
\
Forty years ago a friend told me a story about John Paul Jones that I can neither verify nor defend. But it is more intriguing than the possibility that the wrong body is in the crypt at the Naval Academy (The Sunday Capital, April 16).
\
My friend said that he had a great-uncle who served on board the ship that was used to return Jones' body to America at the beginning of the last century. This great-uncle claimed that there is nobody (as in no body) in the crypt at the academy.
\
The crew and officers of the ship decided that the only fitting and proper tribute to the father of the United States Navy would be burial at sea, and they acted accordingly. Subsequently, an empty coffin was interred at the Naval Academy crypt.
\
Obviously, if any of the anthropological examinations of Jones' body, as described in the article, were performed in America, then the burial-at-sea story must be false. But I still like it better.
\
Commemorating the life, service and contributions of John Paul Jones to our country, as has been done at the academy, should be the important issue. Whether he is buried at sea, at the academy or in France, this great naval hero should be allowed to rest in peace.

Red-light cameras
\
The letters concerning red-light cameras (The Capital, April 10), one against and one for the cameras (the latter from Russ Rader, the media director of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Arlington, Va.) have me thoroughly disgusted with our society.
\
The only reason the state has collected so many dollars from people who think they can beat the system is that those people are the guilty ones and should pay.
\
I just hope none of these people who are complaining lose a loved one because of a red-light runner. I was blessed that a member of my family narrowly escaped death when a pickup truck went through a red light and crashed into the car.
\
So I have no pity for you people who complain and have to pay. Yellow lights are to make drivers stop, and not to make them step on the gas!

Tax burden
\
All the hearings about looking out for taxpayers, at all the levels of government, are a little ironic.
\
Take a family of four with a combined income of $100,000 a year.
\
Here's its spending: $6,000 for groceries; $1,500, pharmaceuticals; $3,000, electricity; $4,500, oil; $1,200, cable TV; $600, telephone service; $3,000, clothes; $1,200, cell phones; $6,000, health care; $3,000, entertainment; $6,000, cars; $2,000, miscellaneous; $10,750, mortgage.
\
The total: $48,750.
\
Now this is where I get worried. Here is that family's tax load: $30,000 for federal taxes; $8,000, state tax; $4,000, county tax; $2,250, sales tax; $6,000, property tax; $1,000, gas tax.
\
The total: $51,250.
\
I know some people's numbers might be different, but you get the message.
\
I worry about the cost of government far more than about the costs of the other things in our lives. The marketplace will keep those prices down, but there is no competition for government.
\
Vote only for those who promise tax cuts and smaller government.
\
Maybe it's time these government bodies started figuring out how they can save the taxpayers money by downsizing or merging to keep prices affordable, as they do in corporate America.
\
Do we really need three levels of departments of the environment or three levels of departments of education? Or multiple levels of any of the other departments that repeat themselves at every level of government?

215,"The gas tax's 'toll on America' is too heavy\I read with astonishment your editorial calling for a 15-cent increase in the federal gas tax, to 33.4 cents per gallon (""The toll on America,"" Dec. 5). \This is on the heels of Gov. Martin O'Malley's hike in the state gas tax, which will go up every year because it's tied into the Consumer Price Index. By the end of this decade, Maryland's gas tax could be pushing 50 cents per gallon. \The Sun trots out all the usual reasons for supporting this new tax: ""The federal gas tax hasn't been raised since 1993,"" and an increase is needed to build and maintain new roads and bridges, it will help the economy and, the best one, other industrial nations tax their people more -- so we should too. \Correct me if I'm wrong, but has The Sun ever seen a tax it didn't support? \How about having the federal government stop sending billions of our tax dollars to prop up foreign countries -- especially the ones that hate us? \I am so sick of the liberal, progressive, socialist rulers of this state bleeding us dry little by little, while The Sun keeps preaching that it's all for our own good. \Mark Wilson, Fallston \Impact statement needed for Cove Point LNG project \I was astonished by Dominion Transmission executive Diane Leopold's recent commentary downplaying the need for an environmental impact statement regarding a proposed liquid natural gas plant near Cove Point residential neighborhoods (""Dominion Transmission: Cove Point LNG project environmentally sound,"" Dec. 4). \Ms. Leopold blithely proclaims that Dominion will ""clean the air of other smog-producing emissions by paying companies for their reduced emissions of pollution, as permitted by federal and state law."" Her logic is as twisted as it is offensive to residents of Cove Point, who are going to end up on the smoggy end of this deal. \Where are all these companies that will be reducing their emissions so Dominion can pollute our air -- are they even in Maryland? Dominion has no right to trade our quality of life to anyone at any price, nor do the Calvert County commissioners. \The residents of Cove Point stand in solidarity with our friends and neighbors in places like Dimock, Pa., who have been left with decimated property values and unsafe drinking water by an unregulated fracking industry. \We stand united with our neighbors in Myersville, Md., who are fighting to keep a Dominion gas pipeline compressor station from being built perilously close to an elementary school. \An environmental impact statement is definitely needed by Cove Point residents and all our neighbors on the East Coast who will be impacted by this massive, industrial gas export project. \Sue Allison, Lusby \Legalization is the best way to reduce the risks of pot \In response to Nancy Starr's recent letter, those of us who advocate for a regulated, aboveboard cannabis market do not argue that the use of marijuana by adults is without potential risks or that it cannot be abused by some people (""Don't legalize pot,"" Nov. 30). \But acknowledging the potential risks does not justify the substance's continued criminalization. In fact, just the opposite is true. \There are numerous adverse health consequences associated with alcohol, tobacco and prescription drugs, all of which are far more dangerous and costlier to society than cannabis. \It is precisely because of these consequences that such products are legally regulated and their use is restricted to specified consumers and settings. \Similarly, a regulatory framework that allows for the legal, licensed commercial production and sale of cannabis to adults, and restricts its use among young people, is the best way to reduce the risks associated with the plant's use -- especially when coupled with a legal environment that fosters open, honest dialogue between parents and children about cannabis' potential harms. \By contrast, the current criminalization of cannabis only compounds these risks. \Paul Armentano, Washington, D.C. \The writer is deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. \Md. liquor laws outdated \Betty Buck missed a great opportunity with her commentary (""The failed experiment of Prohibition,"" Dec. 5). While there are plenty of things learned from Prohibition, her offering revealed none of them. \Whether her organization has anything to do with it or not, Maryland is a repressed state where retailers (and consumers) are forced to pay excessive prices because of the system of middlemen she calls the ""collaborative system between producers, distributors and retailers"" and the ""transparent supply chain."" \How this layer of middlemen helps to make the product safer, or in her words to ""ensure that consumers are of legal drinking age,"" is a mystery. \We will have the gold standard she describes when the free market is allowed to work properly. Stay thirsty! \J. Tarleton\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
216,"Make the petition process easier, not harder\Your report on moves to change state referendum procedures repeatedly refers to ""electronic signatures"" (""Petition process under scrutiny,"" Jan. 9). That is a misnomer. \It would be nice if in the 21st century we were allowed to petition our government in a modern way. But in fact the voter must sign a physical piece of paper with a pen. The only part of the process that can be interpreted as ""electronic"" is that the petition form itself is created individually, with the name and address fields filled in with information extracted from the state's voter registration database. \That procedure did not evolve in a vacuum. It was created because the state was invalidating an exorbitant number of signatures for minor reasons -- such as leaving out a middle initial -- when previously such restrictions had not been applied. \It is difficult to walk up to a voter on the street who can recall information precisely as is recorded in the state's files. Personalizing a petition form merely improves accuracy and assists in the state's onerous validation process. \The brouhaha over the governor's and others' rebellion against citizens' having the effrontery to challenge new laws results from its application to the referendum process. Lost in the dust is the fact that third parties must come up with 10,000 petition signatures merely to be recognized by the state -- and the same stringent rules are applied to these petitions, too. (The 10,000 signatures are required despite the fact that a third party may have more than that number of registered members.) \In the case Libertarian Party of Maryland and Maryland Green Party v. Maryland State Board of Elections, a state circuit court judge ruled that the signature requirements were in fact overly restrictive. He was using common sense, but the Maryland Court of Appeals overruled him in a unanimous decision that was clearly politically driven. \Electronically generated petitions are merely a consequence of how difficult it is to meet the state-mandated requirements. What is really needed is a revision of the petition laws in a way that enhances, rather than diminishes, the rights of Maryland citizens. \Robert E. Glaser, Owings Mills \The writer is secretary of the Maryland Libertarian Party. \A gas tax is unfair to everyone \The gas tax is just about the most regressive tax that exists in a place like Maryland, where living in a safe community with good schools means one must live in the suburbs (""Va. takes the lead,"" Jan. 10). \Taxing the gasoline that people need to work, to acquire higher education, to seek medical care and to buy food makes as much sense -- i.e. none -- as paying for: \*K-12 education by charging parents tuition equal to the cost per child, with higher fees for parents of special needs children since they are so much more expensive to educate than other children; \*Police services by charging a fee to each victim of an accident or crime; \*Firefighting by charging a fee per fire or accident or per life saved; \*Snow removal by charging property owners a fee per foot of property frontage. \Paying for highways and supporting public transportation with a gas tax makes no more sense than funding other essential public services through user fees. \It is grossly unfair to the poor, the unemployed and to middle income citizens who are least able to pay it and who are most likely to be deterred from seeking better employment and higher education because of the added cost. \The proposal of the Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell to eliminate the gas tax shows a genuine recognition of how fundamental gasoline is to life in America. Maryland would do well to eliminate the gas tax and fund transportation with an income or capital gains tax increase instead. \Anita Heygster, Pasadena \The long-term costs of fracking are unknown \The Sun deserves praise for its thoughtful arguments in support of legislation requiring careful study before extracting natural gas through hydraulic fracturing is permitted in Maryland (""No study, no fracking,"" Dec. 26). Your editorial succinctly outlined the key players and the legislative timetable this debate involves. \The enormous advertising budgets devoted to promoting natural gas, and the hype regarding its economic benefits should indeed make us wonder whether the long-term costs of fracking are being downplayed. \The truth is that no one knows what those long-term costs are. Well casings gradually fail over time, toxic fracking fluids diffuse underground, climate-clobbering methane leaks into the air and none of these things can be repaired with money. \Recent history has witnessed many unfortunate cases of chemicals whose use or release into the environment was banned only after unforeseen damaging effects. This study will help to raise public awareness of the trade-offs we face in pursuing fossil fuels by ever more extreme methods. \D. Travis Gallagher, Potomac\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
217,"
Soaring gas prices have pushed Marylanders out of the driver's seat and ultimately could lead to cutbacks in road construction.
\
According to figures released this week, Maryland drivers drove 700 million fewer miles between November 2007 and May 2008 than in the same period last year.
\
And the less gas people guzzle in the state, the less tax money goes into Maryland's Transportation Trust Fund to design, build and maintain roads.
\
For the month of May, the state's vehicle-miles declined 4.2 percent, or 200 million fewer miles than in May of last year.
\
May's drop comes during a month that traffic usually rises because of the Memorial Day holiday and the start of the summer vacation season. But not only are people cutting back on their own driving, they are increasingly using fuel-efficient vehicles, carpooling and taking mass transportation, which may be good for the environment but puts fewer pennies toward roadwork.
\
Maryland Department of Transportation Secretary John D. Porcari said with less collected gas tax, the state's Transportation Trust Fund revenue has taken a hit and will force the department to prioritize just the projects necessary toward maintaining the existing transportation infrastructure.
\
All Maryland Department of Transportation activities are supported by the trust fund, including debt service, maintenance, operations, administration and capital projects.
\
Examples of projects this money funds are interchanges, road-widening and lane additions.
\
""Some of the trends that you see at the national level - some of the biggest declines since World War II nationally - are happening in every state, including Maryland,"" Mr. Porcari said. ""That will have some impact on our capital program.""
\
The state's Consolidated Transportation Program includes $10.6 billion for capital transportation projects over a six-year period. In the current fiscal year, the state transportation department has budgeted $1.9 billion to spend on highway, transit, port, airport and Motor Vehicle Administration projects.
\
Because less money is funneling into the state's transportation fund, Mr. Porcari said the department will be selective in how it schedules projects in the capital program, making maintenance of the current transportation system the top priority and all other projects ancillary.
\
But some kinds of projects will not be touched by the cutbacks at all.
\
Among those projects are bridge rehabilitation and replacement needs, as well as other safety projects that have separate funds that will remain stable, he said.
\
Anne Arundel County has two major bridge projects listed on the state's six-year CTP: the bridge over Bacon Ridge Ranch on Defense Highway and the bridge over CSX Railroad on Route 732.
\
MDOT spokesman Jack Cahalan said the Bay Bridge also will not be affected by funding shortfalls because, although it is part of the federal highway system, the bridge is owned and operated by the Maryland Transportation Authority. The tolls collected at seven locations around the state fund all of the Bay Bridge's maintenance.
\
""The bottom line is that toll revenue, not federal dollars, are used to maintain and improve the Bay Bridge,"" Mr. Cahalan said. ""The state of federal funding should not impact the Bay Bridge.""
\
Mr. Porcari said the department does not yet know how much less revenue it will have available to spend in the coming year but will have a better idea in late August when analysts compile financial data.
\
David Roose, the director of the state's Bureau of Revenue Estimates, said the gas tax is holding basically flat from last year. Typically, the tax grows 1 to 2 percent a year, he said.
\
The state received $756 million in gas tax revenue in fiscal 2007, and the original estimate for fiscal 2008 was $764 million.
\
Today, for every gallon of gas purchased in Maryland, customers pay 23.5 cents in state and 18.4 cents in federal taxes.
\
But motor-fuel tax contributes to only 19 percent of the money flowing into the Transportation Trust Fund.
\
Another major source of revenue come from motor vehicle titling taxes, which makes up 20 percent of the fund. Additionally, the lagging economy has inevitably driven down vehicle sales across the country, with 3 million less cars sold nationally compared with last year. It accounts to just one more setback for all transportation needs, with Maryland being no exception.
\
The other 61 percent of the fund's revenue comes from federal aid, MVA registration and fees, corporate income taxes, transit fares and fees, bonds, and sales and use taxes.
\
Despite the current dilemma state transportation officials face, Mr. Porcari said there are no signs of a gas tax hike on the near horizon.
\
""We don't have any plans to do that,"" he said. ""The General Assembly approved a big increase for transportation funding in the last session. It's time for our federal counterparts to do that same.""
\
With all Americans scaling back the distances they're driving, the scope of the problem can be extrapolated to the federal level.
\
The federal highway trust fund, which relies on per-gallon taxes that don't rise with price, faces a multibillion dollar shortfall next year, down from a surplus of more than $10 billion just three years ago.
\
According to Federal Highway Administration data released Monday, Americans drove 9.6 billion fewer miles in May 2008 than in May 2007, the third-largest monthly drop in the 66 years the data has been collected.
\
If revenue dips too low on the state or national end, that may make future projects difficult to fund, with the cost of steel having risen 35 percent and liquid paving asphalt having climbed 105 percent just in the past six months.
\
Mr. Porcari, however, believes it's important to look at this trend with a long-term perspective.
\
""What's healthy in the future is less driving,"" he said. ""It may cause some short-term pain on revenues, but the larger picture is to have a more sustainable and maintainable transportation infrastructure.""

221," AS MARYLAND legislators convene today in Annapolis, it bears repeating what their first order of business is: Confronting the $1.8 billion budget deficit for this year and next.\ Delegates and senators must solve immense financial problems without making government more dependent on gambling, without disrupting critically important programs and without killing valuable momentum achieved in recent years on public secondary and higher education, crime-fighting, environmental protection and many other fronts.\ The General Assembly ought to begin by scheduling hearings on an array of revenue sources - yes, tax proposals. A surtax on the wealthiest income-tax payers or broadening the sales tax are alternatives that should be carefully considered.\ Hearings on revenue-raising alternatives should begin immediately even as Gov.-elect Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. prepares to offer his own budget-balancing proposal: slot machines at the racetracks. Once legislators see their options, they should kill the slots legislation. Government must be paid for by all the citizens.\ The Assembly will not be successful unless it balances the budget in a responsible way - and accomplishes a number of other objectives in areas from health care to law enforcement. For those who follow the Assembly's activities - and everyone should - here's a checklist of essential actions:\ Environment - Protect the Glendening administration's Smart Growth incentives. Look for creative ways to maintain state land- preservation funds and increase funding for Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts by improving wastewater and sewer systems.\ Public safety - Maintain and increase drug treatment funding ($25 million) for Baltimore, where progress against illegal drug sales has helped reduce violent crime. Provide more money for residential drug treatment programs. Include funding for DNA testing.\ Health care - Provide sufficient funding for community mental health clinics. Approve a fee to be added to insurance policies to provide $18 million for trauma surgeons. Reject the proposed for- profit conversion and sale of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. Continue funding for lead paint abatement.\ Death penalty - Take action on the findings of a commission that studied the equitability of the death penalty. Preliminary reports suggest the study will say race plays a nefarious role in deciding who lives or dies in Maryland's criminal justice system, and that's unacceptable.\ Education - Fully fund the Thornton Commission's recommendations. Provide sufficient higher-education funding to continue the University System of Maryland's momentum toward national status.\ Transportation - Proceed with the Intercounty Connector highway in Montgomery County. Approve a gas tax increase. Proceed with a study of the Baltimore regional transportation system.\ Economic development - Continue the state's commitment to Baltimore's biotech park ($7 million) and to the west-side project ($5 million). Maintain or increase the value of the historic preservation tax credits.\ A state as wealthy as Maryland - one with a progressive tradition of caring government - should be able to handle these needs. But it will require a legislature of will and vision."
222," If there is a theme for the 1991 General Assembly session that begins a 90-day stand in Annapolis today it is the government's lack of money. The state is deep in the revenue hole, putting a crimp in every agency agenda. That could make this an unhappy meeting for lawmakers, who must face the public's wrath for decimating popular services or for raising taxes to keep these programs going. It is a no-win situation.\ Gov. William Donald Schaefer is in a similar bind. He plans to support a hefty gas-tax increase to keep the state's road-building and mass-transit priorities on schedule. But he may have to forgo tax reforms recommended by the Linowes commission. That means major cuts in existing programs to balance the budget. Mr. Schaefer won't win any popularity contest this year.\ Forty-six new lawmakers will bring some fresh ideas to the State House. Within leadership ranks, both House Speaker R. Clayton Mitchell and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller have made changes in their top lieutenants, though the two chambers remain quite different: the disciplined House follows the speaker's lead; the unpredictable Senate retains its independence. Cooperation with the governor may be fragile and sporadic.\ Abortion, which nearly strangled the 1990 legislature, will again be debated. This time leaders want no repeat of last year's near-disastrous filibuster. They have promised rapid votes in both houses on bills to liberalize state abortion law.\ Campaign and ethics reforms, often non-starters in the past, stand a good chance this year, thanks to the overzealous fund-raising tactics and legislative activities of some lobbyists. A bill closing loopholes in the Open Meetings Law also could receive favorable attention.\ A proposal controlling local growth already has led to protests. Counties fear a state takeover of local zoning; officials in Annapolis fear a continuation of the rampant scattershot growth patterns that threaten Maryland's environment and government's ability to pay for costly infrastructure.\ Insurance matters will draw much attention. A no-fault insurance plan for drivers faces troubles in the Senate. Plans to help uninsured Marylanders get health coverage could fare better.\ Another attempt to ban assault rifles is likely, and may succeed with the governor's help. But an effort to legalize off-track betting may have been dealt a fatal blow by the money and legal problems of harness-track owner Mark Vogel.\ With the governor's fiscal cupboard as empty as it has been in a decade, there won't be much joy among lawmakers. And if more revenues have to be found to continue the state's road and bridge repairs it could, indeed, turn into a taxing General Assembly session."
223,"CORRECTION: An article on Wednesday's front page about state transportation funding incorrectly described an interchange at Fort Meade to be rebuilt for $29 million. It is the interchange at Route 175 and Route 295. The Sun regrets the errors.\Gov. Martin O'Malley plans to announce $1.5 billion in new state funding for the Baltimore Red Line and more than a dozen other transportation projects in the area today, officials said, outlining for the first time how the state's gas tax increase will be tapped to improve local infrastructure and mass transit here.\O'Malley also plans to discuss the state's interest in attracting public-private partnerships to help fund the Red Line project, and a Dec. 7 start date for weekend MARC train service between Baltimore and Washington, which has never been offered before. \In a statement, O'Malley described the transportation spending as ""making the modern investments a modern economy requires"" to educate, innovate and rebuild the state. \The state Department of Transportation said the funding, which O'Malley is scheduled to announce alongside Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and other officials at the West Baltimore MARC station this afternoon, would create about 13,000 jobs and ease congestion as busy arteries are widened or improved and mass transit systems are prioritized. \Rawlings-Blake said the new funding ""says that the state is serious about being a partner with Baltimore"" to improve connections between transportation options. \""They're putting their money where their mouth is,"" she said. ""They're recognizing that for the state to be strong, Baltimore has to be strong, and it has to be strong as a connected city."" \The gas tax, approved earlier this year by the Maryland General Assembly, is expected to dramatically change the environment for transportation construction in the state, reversing a trend of diminished ability -- and ambition -- when it comes to the state's taking on major projects. \The gas tax and other fees are expected to provide $4.4 billion for transportation projects over six years. \The Democratic legislature approved the higher gas tax and new fees -- expected to provide $4.4 billion for transportation projects over six years -- over the objections of Republicans who viewed the hikes as too steep for consumers. \Transportation Secretary James Smith said the new transportation funding makes clear the benefits of the gas tax. \""What's happening is people are actually seeing what they're getting for this money. There is a direct correlation between the projects that are being announced and the money that is being raised,"" he said. ""And I do think people have a kinder attitude when they don't think the money is going down a black hole."" \Sen. James ""Ed"" DeGrange, who chairs the Senate transportation budget subcommittee, agreed. \""That's what we all wanted to see when they were proposing the increase in the tax: 'What are we going to get for those dollars?'"" the Anne Arundel County Democrat said. ""And I guess this is the effect of it. A lot of those projects are coming off the back burner."" \In all, 17 projects are to be announced for the city and Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard counties. \Plans include $20 million for streetscape improvements in downtown Hampstead in Carroll; $43 million to improve intersections along access routes to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Harford; $29 million to rebuild the interchange between Route 29 and Interstate 295 at Fort Meade in Anne Arundel; $48 million to widen Route 29 in Howard; and $86 million to widen Interstate 695 between Route 40 and Route 144 in Baltimore County. \Another $246 million is to be spent on replacing the Baltimore Metro's fleet of 100 railcars and 15 miles of signaling systems, and $12 million is to go toward the operating costs of the Charm City Circulator. \More than a third of the new funding -- $519 million -- is to be spent on construction on the Baltimore Red Line, a $2.6 billion, 14.1-mile light rail project to cut through the heart of downtown Baltimore, connecting Woodlawn in the west with Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center to the east. In May, officials announced $170 million for the project's right-of-way acquisition and final design. \The state is to begin considering proposals from private industry for certain aspects of the project, including track and signal operations and maintenance of some facilities and assets, such as railcars. \Officials said they do not plan to seek public-private partnerships to pay for the Red Line's major infrastructure, such as tunnels, underground stations and stormwater management systems. \Hundreds of contractors have expressed interest in bidding on the project in recent months. The Federal Transit Administration, which is expected to foot part of the transit project bill under its New Starts program, encourages public-private partnerships. \The state has said it plans to use a public-private partnership to build the Purple Line in the Washington suburbs. \Smith said the level of public-private partnership for the Red Line has not been determined, but it will be a much smaller percentage of the project than the Purple Line because the underground system planned for Baltimore is more complex. \""Tunnel boring isn't something that generally works with a developer,"" he said. \Donald C. Fry, president and CEO of the Greater Baltimore Committee, said the interest shown by hundreds of companies at a forum on Red Line public-private partnerships suggests private industry is clamoring for a way to benefit from the project. \""In cities where there have been new transit locations,"" Fry said, ""that's where a significant amount of development occurred."" \Companies have already applied to help build the Purple Line in Montgomery County. \""If you look at the industry landscape across the country, it's no secret that our infrastructure is in crisis,"" said Jessica Murray, a spokeswoman for the Alexandria, Va., construction firm Skanska. ""The reality is, if you don't have a private company come in and build it, it's probably not going to get done."" \Murray said projects such as the Purple and Red lines give infrastructure companies with access to capital, such as Skanska, profitable deals with a promised revenue stream, and allows governments to build infrastructure it couldn't otherwise afford. \""It's a way for it to work for everybody,"" she said. ""We can come in and design and build the best operating system possible. We can bring in maintenance and facilities people that will make sure everything is operating at top shape."" \DeGrange, the transportation budget subcommittee chairman, said public-private partnerships can allow a state to build necessary infrastructure and spread the cost -- but should be undertaken cautiously. \""The devil is in the details, always, to see exactly what the total cost is going to be over the entire contract, and what the benefits are going to be,"" he said. ""You have to be careful how you are mortgaging the future."" \Nearly $100 million in new funding will allow the Maryland Transit Administration to expand MARC train service to include nine round trips Baltimore and Washington on the Penn Line on Saturday and six on Sunday, to buy two new locomotives and to offer two additional daily weekday round trips on the Camden Line. \Del. James E. Malone Jr., a Baltimore County Democrat and chair of the House transportation subcommittee, said the Dec. 7 start to weekend service would provide opportunities for people to travel between Baltimore and Washington and spend money, especially during the holidays. \""I'm very ecstatic about that,"" he said. ""It will be great for people to be able to use it on the weekend, for people who want to go downtown to do Christmas shopping, downtown to see all the different Christmas lights, all the different functions, all the different shows."" \krector@baltsun.com \twitter.com/rectorsun \New transportation projects in the Baltimore region \$519 million: Initiate construction of the Red Line ($170 million for rights of way and final design was announced in May). \$246 million: Replace Baltimore Metro's fleet of 100 railcars and 15 miles of signaling systems. \$86 million: Construction funds to widen the outer loop of Interstate 695 between U.S. 40 and Route 144 in Baltimore County. \$60 million: Construction funds to improve traffic flow on Interstate 695 at Leeds Avenue and replace two bridges in the same area in Baltimore County. \COMPLETE LIST, PG12 \Transportation projects in the Baltimore region \$519 million to initiate construction of the Red Line ($170 million for right way and final design was announced in May). \$246 million to replace Baltimore Metro's fleet of 100 railcars and 15 miles of signaling systems. \$86 million in construction funds to widen the outer loop of Interstate 695 between Route 40 and Route 144 in Baltimore County. \$75 million in construction funds to build a new Kirk Bus Division transportation and storage building in Baltimore City. \$60 million in construction funds to improve traffic flow on Interstate 695 at Leeds Avenue and replace two bridges in the same area in Baltimore County. \$52 million for MARC Commuter Rail improvements to purchase 10 new diesel locomotives and add 2 weekday round trips on the Camden Line. \$48 million in construction funds to widen Route 29 northbound in Howard County. \$46 million to operate MARC weekend service to Washington on the Penn Line, with 9 round trips on Saturdays and 6 round trips on Sundays. \$43 million in construction funds to improve key intersections along access routes to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Harford County. \$29 million in right-of-way funds to reconstruct the existing interchange between Route 175 and Interstate 295 near Fort Meade in Anne Arundel County. \$29 million in construction funds to make safety improvements on Interstate 695 at the Harford Road interchange in Baltimore County. \$20 million in construction funds to provide streetscape improvements to Route 30 Business in Hampstead in Carroll County. \$12 million in operating assistance through 2019 for the Charm City Circulator in Baltimore City. \$8 million in construction funds to build a sound wall along Interstate 95 near the Lawyers Hill community in Howard County. \$7 million in construction funds to provide streetscape improvements to Route 755 in Edgewood in Harford County. \$3 million in right-of-way funds to widen Route 140 at Painters Mill Road in Baltimore County. \$2 million in planning funds to study improvements to reduce traffic congestion along Route 50 over the Severn River Bridge in Anne Arundel County.\Credit: The Baltimore Sun"
224," Partnerships with bottlers aid Md. schools\ In a whirlwind of political cries that something must be done to manage the epidemic of obesity, the editorial ""Soda under siege"" (Jan. 12) called for bans on the sale of certain beverages in high schools. Unfortunately, it is impossible to pick a ""poster child"" for the obesity problem, and this move would do little to decrease obesity rates among students.\ Childhood obesity presents a serious and complex problem. While there is no easy answer, the most important things children and adults can do to achieve a healthy lifestyle are to eat a balanced diet and get at least 30 minutes of physical activity a day.\ Schools are second only to parents as care providers. That is why schools must play a more constructive role when it comes to student health. Sadly, national statistics show only 25 percent of students in kindergarten through Grade 12 receive daily physical education, and schools spend only five hours per academic year on nutrition education.\ The real solution to the obesity problem is daily physical education and more nutrition education for every school-age student. As a society, we have got to get children and adults to log off the computer, turn off the television, get up off the couch and get moving.\ Maryland schools have developed successful partnerships with the local bottling companies. These partnerships support academic programs and important after-school activities at a time when many schools lack the funding necessary to provide a well-rounded education for their students.\ Local educators, in consultation with parent and community groups, determine what beverages are offered in vending machines and how the proceeds will be spent. These partnerships offer students a wide variety of beverage choices, including bottled water, teas, juices, diet beverages and sports drinks.\ And the extra revenue allows schools to meet a wide range of needs including scholarships, books, computers, video equipment, security systems, prom needs, sports equipment and clothing for needy students.\ Ellen Valentino\ Annapolis\ The writer is executive vice president of the Maryland Soft Drink Association.\ Sugar isn't cause of hyperactivity\ Sugar does not ""exacerbate hyperactivity"" as the editorial ""Soda under siege"" (Jan. 12) claims that it does. Many studies have shown that sugar doesn't negatively affect children's behavior. This misconception persists partly because it is repeated so often.\ High-sugar, low-nutrient foods such as soda can displace nutrient- rich foods children need and can contribute calories that, if not used, will be stored as excess body fat. And fermentable carbohydrates such as the sugar in fruit and cooked starch can also promote cavities.\ There are good reasons to limit children's consumption of empty- calorie foods such as soda, but hyperactivity isn't one of them.\ Peggy K. Yen\ Baltimore\ The writer is a nutrition consultant.\ Gov. Ehrlich is doing what the voters want\ It's hard to not be amused by the Democratic members of the General Assembly (and Sun reporters) who criticize Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. for his lack of accomplishments during last year's session (""No `free pass' given for Assembly session,"" Jan. 14).\ But without resorting to major tax increases, Mr. Ehrlich was able to balance a state budget that was drowning under the weight of the accomplishments of the last governor and past sessions of the General Assembly. If the governor does nothing more during his first term than continue to rein in the tax-and-spend desires of the Assembly, his popularity will remain at its high level and help ensure him a second term.\ Mr. Ehrlich is doing exactly what a majority of Maryland voters elected him to do.\ Todd Eberly\ Columbia\ The wrong nominee for the environment\ I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.'s nomination of Kendl P. Philbrick to head the Maryland Department of the Environment.\ From what I read in Tom Horton's column ""Philbrick working to learn the ropes,"" (Jan. 9), it appears Mr. Philbrick possesses no experience working on environmental issues and programs.\ As nitrogen pollution in the Chesapeake Bay continues to increase, destroying an economic resource valued at billions of dollars, can we say we've picked the right person for a job of such paramount importance?\ If not, this reflects poorly on Maryland's leadership.\ Will Weiskopf\ Catonsville\ Maglev can lead us to a cleaner future\ The Sun's news item ""Mayor to discuss maglev with Chinese official today"" (Jan. 12) was both right on time and on target, and is about one idea on which Mayor Martin O'Malley and Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. can work together for the good of all citizens.\ If this maglev project is a success, I would propose that a second line be built between Baltimore and Ocean City to reduce automobile traffic in that corridor as well.\ The Germans had synthetic fuels in 1945, and the technology for water and electric power vehicles has been available to us since 1964. Yet the United States continues to rush into the future clinging to the technology of two centuries ago, the outdated internal combustion engine. As a result, we go to war in Iraq for oil and despoil our Alaskan lands by drilling for more oil.\ Science and technology made this country great, but we are resting on our laurels at peril to our environment.\ Blaine Taylor\ Towson\ Is pushing gas tax bad for business?\ The Sun's article ""Business leaders urge gas tax rise"" (Jan. 15) didn't mention just what businesses these leaders represent.\ Please make the names of these operations available so that I can make sure that they don't get another dime from me or other like- minded Marylanders.\ Russell Reed\ Woodstock\ Better ways to solve prescription problem\ James K. Glassman writes that the solution to other countries getting their prescription drugs at lower prices than Americans do isn't to negotiate lower prices for Americans - it's to jack the prices up for everyone else (""No more free ride,"" Opinion * Commentary,"" Jan. 11). Here's a better solution: End all subsidies to drug manufacturers.\ Outlaw all advertising of drugs to the general public, returning the control over medicine to doctors, where it belongs. Allow anyone - a trade group, a business, a state or even a country - to negotiate its own price for medicines without restrictions. That's not called ""price controls."" It's called ""volume discounts"" - and it's how companies such as Wal-Mart and The Home Depot got so big.\ And end this nonsense of dragging out patent expirations in courts, as the drug companies do again and again to try to squeeze a few more dollars out of the public.\ William Smith\ Baltimore"
225," Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the House and the Senate, distinguished Americans here as visitors in this chamber as am I, it is nice to have a fresh excuse for a long speech.\ When Presidents speak to the Congress and the nation from this podium, typically they comment on the full range of challenges and opportunities that face the United States. But this is not an ordinary time and for all the many tasks that require our attention, I believe one calls on us to focus, to unite and to act, and that is our economy. For more than anything else, our task tonight as Americans is to make our economy thrive once again.\ Let me begin by saying that it has been too long -- at least three decades -- since a President has come and challenged Americans to join him on a great national journey, not merely to consume the bounty of today but to invest for a much greater one tomorrow.\ Like individuals, nations must ultimately decide how they wish to conduct themselves -- how they wish to be thought of by those with whom they live, and, later, how they wish to be judged by history. Like every individual man and woman, nations must decide whether they are prepared to rise to the occasions history presents them.\ We have always been a people of youthful energy and daring spirit. And this historic moment, as communism has fallen, as freedom is spreading around the world, as a global economy is taking shape before our eyes, Americans have called for change -- and now it is up to those of us in this room to deliver for them. `Nation needs new direction'\ Our nation needs a new direction. Tonight, I present to you a comprehensive plan to set our nation on that new course.\ I believe we will find our new direction in the basic old values that brought us here over the last two centuries: a commitment to opportunity, to individual responsibility, to community, to work, to family and to faith. We need to break the habits of both political parties and say there can be no more something for nothing, and admit, frankly, that we are all in this together.\ The conditions which brought us to this point are well known. Two decades of low productivity and stagnant wages; persistent unemployment and underemployment; years of huge government deficits and declining investment in our future; exploding health care costs, and lack of coverage for millions of Americans; legions of poor children; education and job training opportunities inadequate to the demands of this tough global economy. For too long we drifted without a strong sense of purpose or responsibility or community, and our political system so often has seemed paralyzed by special interest groups, by partisan bickering and by the sheer complexity of our problems. `We can do better'\ I believe we can do better, because we remain the greatest nation on earth, the world's strongest economy, the world's only military superpower. If we have the vision, the will and the heart to make the changes we must, we can still enter the 21st century with possibilities our parents could not even have imagined and enter it having secured the American dream for ourselves and for future generations.\ I well remember, twelve years ago Ronald Reagan stood at this very podium and told the American people that if our debt were stacked in thousand dollar bills, the stack would reach 67 miles into space. Well, today, that stack would reach 267 miles.\ I tell you this not to assign blame for this problem. There is plenty of blame to go around -- in both branches of the government and both parties. The time for blame has come to an end. I did not seek this office to assign blame. I come here tonight to accept responsibility; and I want you to accept responsibility with me. And if we do it right by this country, I do not care who gets the credit for it. `Four fundamental components'\ The plan I offer you has four fundamental components:\ First, it shifts our emphasis in public and private spending from consumption to investment, initially by jump-starting the economy in the short term and investing in our people, their jobs and their incomes in the long term.\ Second, it changes the rhetoric of the past into the actions of the present, by honoring work and families in every part of our public decision-making.\ Third, it substantially reduces the federal deficit, honestly and credibly, by using in the beginning the most conservative estimates of government revenues, not as the executive branch has done so often in the past using the most optimistic ones.\ And finally, it seeks to earn the trust of the American people by paying for these plans first with cuts in government waste and inefficiency; second, with cuts, not gimmicks, in government spending; and by fairness, for a change, in the way the additional burdens are borne.\ Tonight, I want to talk with you about what government can do, because I believe government must do more. But let me say first that the real engine of economic growth in this country is the private sector.\ And second, that each of us must be an engine of growth and change. The truth is that, as government creates more opportunity in this new and different time, we must also demand more responsibility in return. `Priority is to create jobs'\ Our immediate priority is to create jobs, create jobs now. Some say, well, we're in a recovery and we don't have to do that. Well, we all hope we're in a recovery. But we're sure not creating more jobs. And there is no recovery worth its salt that doesn't put the American people back to work.\ To create jobs and guarantee a strong recovery, I call on Congress to enact an immediate package of jobs investment of over $30 billion, to put people to work now, to create half a million jobs: jobs to rebuild our highways and airports, to renovate housing, to bring new life to rural communities, and spread hope and opportunity among our nation's youth.\ And especially, I want to emphasize, after the events of last year in Los Angeles, and the countless stories of despair in our cities and in our poor rural communities, this proposal will create almost 700,000 new summer jobs for displaced, unemployed young people alone this summer.\ And tonight I invite America's business leaders to join us in this effort, so that together we can provide a million summer jobs in cities and poor rural areas for our young people.\ Second, our plan looks beyond today's business cycle, because our aspirations extend into the next century. The heart of this plan deals with the long term. It has an investment program designed to increase public and private investment in areas critical to our economic future.\ Over the long run, all this will bring us a higher rate of economic growth, improved productivity, more high-quality jobs and an improved economic competitive position in the world. In order to accomplish both increased investment and deficit reduction -- something no American government has ever been called upon to do at the same time before -- spending must be cut and taxes must be raised. The spending cuts I recommend were carefully thought through in a way to minimize any adverse economic impact, to capture the peace dividend for investment purposes and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to more investment. The tax increases and the spending cuts were both designed to assure that the costs of this historic program to face and deal with our problems will be borne by those who could readily afford it the most.\ Our plan is designed, furthermore and perhaps in some ways most importantly, to improve the health of American business through lower interest rates, more incentives to invest, and better-trained workers. Because small business has created such a high percentage of all the new jobs in our nation over the last 10 or 15 years, our plan includes the boldest targeted incentives for small business in history.\ We propose a permanent investment tax credit for the smallest firms in this country with revenues of under $5 million.\ That's about 90 percent of the firms in America, employing about 40 percent of the work force, but creating a big majority of the net new jobs for more than a decade. And we propose new rewards for entrepreneurs who take new risks. We propose to give small business access to all the new technologies of our time, and we propose to attack this credit crunch which has denied small business the credit they need to flourish and prosper.\ With a new network of community development banks and $1 billion to make the dream of enterprise zones real, we propose to bring new hope and new jobs to storefronts and factories from South Boston to South Texas to South Central Los Angeles.\ This plan invests in our roads, our bridges, our transit systems and high-speed railways and high tech information systems. And it provides the most ambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with state and local government of our time, to put people to work and to preserve the environment for our future. `Insist on fair trade rules'\ Standing as we are on the edge of a new century, we know that economic growth depends as never before on opening up new markets overseas and expanding the volume of world trade. And so we will insist on fair trade rules in international markets as a part of a national economic strategy to expand trade, including the successful completion of the latest round of world trade talks and the successful completion of a North American Free Trade Agreement, with appropriate safeguards for our workers and for the environment.\ At the same time, and I say this to you in both parties and across America tonight, all the people who are listening, it is not enough to pass a budget or even to have a trade agreement. The world is changing so fast that we must have aggressive, targeted attempts to create the high-wage jobs of the future. That's what all our competitors are doing. We must give special attention to those critical industries that are going to explode in the 21st century, but that are in trouble in America today, like aerospace.\ We must provide special assistance to areas and to workers displaced by cuts in the defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocations.\ And again I will say we must do this together. I pledge to you that I will do my best to see that business and labor and government work together -- for a change. `Tackle health care crisis'\ But all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail -- let me say this again; I feel so strongly about this -- all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail unless we also take this year -- not next year, not five years from now, but this year -- bold steps to reform our health care system.\ In 1992 we spent 14 percent of our income on health care, 30 percent more than than any other country in the world, and yet we were the only advanced nation that did not provide a basic package of health care benefits to all of its citizens. Unless we change the present pattern, 50 percent of the growth in the deficit between now and the year 2000 will be in health care costs. By the year 2000 almost 20 percent of our income will be in health care. Our families will never be secure, our businesses will never be strong, and our government will never again be fully solvent -- until we tackle the health care crisis. We must do it this year.\ The combination of the rising costs of care and the lack of care and the fear of losing care are endangering the security and the very lives of millions of our people, and they are weakening our economy every day. Reducing health care costs can liberate literally hundreds of billions of dollars for new investment and growth and jobs. Bringing health costs in line with inflation would do more for the private sector in this country than any tax cut we could give, than any spending program we could promote. Reforming health care over the long run is critically essential to reducing not only our deficit but to expanding investment in America. `We can do better'\ Later this spring, after the first lady and the many good people who are helping her all across the country complete their work, I will deliver to Congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform that finally will bring costs under control and provide security to all of our families so that no one will be denied the coverage they need, but so that our economic future will not be compromised either.\ We'll have to root out fraud and overcharges and make sure that paperwork no longer chokes your doctor. We'll have to maintain the highest American standards and the right to choose and a system that is the world's finest for all those who can access it.\ But first we must make choices. We must choose to give the American people the quality they demand and deserve with a system that will not bankrupt the country or further drive more Americans into agony. Let me further say that I want to work with all of you on this. I realize this is a complicated issue, but we must address it.\ And I believe if there is any chance that Republicans and Democrats who disagree on taxes and spending or anything else could agree on one thing, surely we can all look at these numbers and go home and tell our people the truth. We cannot continue these spending patterns in public or private dollars for health care for less and less and less every year. We can do better. `Investment in children'\ Perhaps the most fundamental change the new direction I propose offers is its focus on the future and its investment which I seek in our children. Each day we delay really making a commitment to our children carries a dear cost. Half of the two-year olds in this country today don't receive the immunizations they need against deadly diseases. Our plan will provide them for every eligible child. And we know now that we will save ten dollars later for every one dollar we spend by eliminating preventible childhood diseases. That's a good investment no matter how you measure it.\ I recommend that the Women, Infants and Children's nutrition program be expanded so that every expectant mother who needs the help gets it.\ Head Start, a program that prepares children for school, is a success story. We all know that it saves money, but today it just reaches barely over a third of all the eligible children. Under this plan every eligible child will be able to get a head start.\ This is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do. For every dollar we invest today, we'll save three tomorrow. We have to start thinking about tomorrow. I've heard that somewhere before.\ We have to ask more in our schools of our students, our teachers, our principals, our parents. Yes, we must give them the resources they need to meet high standards, but we must also use the authority and the influence and the funding of the Education Department to promote strategies that really work in learning. Money alone is not enough; we have to do what really works to increase learning in our schools.\ We have to recognize that all of our high school graduates need some further education in order to be competitive in this global economy. So we have to establish a partnership between businesses and education and the government for apprenticeship programs in every state in this country to give our people the skills they need.\ Lifelong learning must benefit not just young high school graduates but workers, too, throughout their career. The average 18-year-old today will change jobs seven times in a lifetime. We have done a lot in this country on worker training in the last few years, but the system is too fractured. We must develop a unified, simplified, sensible, streamlined worker training program so that workers receive the training they need regardless of why they lost their jobs or whether they simply need to learn something new to keep them. We have got to do better on this. `National service'\ And finally, I propose a program that got a great response from the American people all across this country last year, a program of national service to make college loans available to all Americans, and to challenge them at the same time to give something back to their country, as teachers or police officers or community service workers; to give them the option to pay the loans back, but at tax time so they can't beat the bill, but to encourage them instead to pay it back by making their country stronger and making their country better and giving us the benefit of their talents.\ A generation ago, when President Kennedy proposed and the United States Congress embraced the Peace Corps, it defined the character of a whole generation of Americans committed to serving people around the world. In this national service program, we will provide more than twice as many slots for people before they go to college to be in national service than ever served in the Peace Corps. This program could do for this generation of members of Congress what the Land Grant College Act did and what the GI Bill did for former congressmen. In the future, historians who got their education through the national service loan will look back on you and thank you for giving America a new lease on life if you meet this challenge.\ If we believe in jobs and we believe in learning, we must believe in rewarding work. If we believe in restoring the values that make America special, we must believe that there is dignity in all work, and there must be dignity for all workers. To those who care for our sick, who tend our children, who do our most difficult and tiring jobs, the new direction I propose will make this solemn, simple commitment: by expanding the refundable earned income tax credit, we will make history; we will reward the work of millions of working poor Americans by realizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you've got a child in the house, you will no longer be in poverty.\ Later this year we offer a plan to end welfare as we know it. I have worked on this issue for the better part of a decade and I know from personal conversations with many people that no one -- no one -- wants to change the welfare system as badly as those who are trapped in it.\ I want to offer the people on welfare the education, the training, the child care, the health care they need to get back on their feet but say after two years they must get back to work, too, in private business if possible, in public service if necessary. We have to end welfare as a way of life and make it a path to independence and dignity. `Strengthen our families'\ Our next great goal should be strengthen our families. I compliment the Congress for passing the Family and Medical Leave Act as a good first step.\ But it is time to do more. This plan will give this country the toughest child support enforcement it has ever had. It has time to demand that people take responsibility for the child they bring into this world.\ And I ask you to help to protect our families against the violent crime which terrorizes our people and which our communities apart. We must pass a tough crime bill.\ I support not only the bill which didn't quite make it to the president's desk last year but also an initiative to put 100,000 more police officers on the street, to provide boot camps for first-time, non-violent offenders, for more space for the hardened criminals in jail.\ And I support an initiative to do what we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. I will make you this bargain: if you pass the Brady bill, I'll sure sign it.\ Let me say now -- we should move to the harder parts.\ I think it is clear to every American, including every member of Congress of both parties, that the confidence of the people who pay our bills in our institutions in Washington is not high. We must restore it. We must begin again to make government work for ordinary taxpayers not simply for organized interest groups, and that beginning must start with real political reform. I am asking the United States Congress to pass a real campaign finance reform bill this year.\ I ask you to increase the participation of the American people by passing the motor voter bill promptly.\ I ask you to deal with the undue influence of special interests by passing a bill to end the tax deductions for lobbying and to act quickly to require all the people who lobby you to register as lobbyists by passing the lobbying registration bill.\ Believe me, they were cheering that last section at home. I believe lobby reform and campaign finance reform are a sure path to increased popularity for Republicans and Democrats alike because it says to the voters back home, this is your House, this is your Senate, we're your hired hands, and every penny we draw is your money. `Live within our means'\ Next, to revolutionize government, we have to ensure that we live within our means, and that should start at the top and with the White House.\ In the last few days, I have announced a cut in the White House staff of 25 percent, saving approximately $10 million. I have ordered administrative cuts in budgets of agencies and departments, I have cut the federal bureaucracy, or will over the next four years, by approximately 100,000 positions, for a combined savings of $9 billion.\ It is time for government to demonstrate in the condition we're in that we can be as frugal as any household in America. And that's why I also want to congratulate the Congress. I noticed the announcement of the leadership today that Congress is taking similar steps to cut its costs. I think that is important, I think it will send a very clear signal to the American people.\ But if we really want to cut spending, we're going to have to do more, and some of it will be difficult. Tonight I call for an across-the-board freeze in federal government salaries for one year. And thereafter during this four-year period, I recommend that salaries rise at one point lower than the cost-of-living allowance normally involved in federal pay increases.\ Next I recommend that we make 150 specific budget cuts, as you know; and that all those who say we should cut more be as specific as I have been.\ Finally, let me say to my friends on both sides of the aisle, it is not enough simply to cut government. We have to rethink the whole way it works. When I became president, I was amazed at just the way the White House worked in ways that added lots of money to what taxpayers had to pay -- outmoded ways that didn't take maximum advantage of technology and didn't do things that any business would have done years ago to save taxpayers' money. `New spirt of innovation'\ So I want to bring a new spirit of innovation into every government department. I want to push education reform, as I said, not just to spend more money but to really improve learning. Some things work and some things don't. We ought to be subsidizing the things that work and discouraging the things that don't. I'd like to use that Superfund to clean up pollution for change and not just pay lawyers.\ In the aftermath of all the difficulties with the savings and loans, we must use federal bank regulators to protect the security and safety of our financial institutions but they should not be used to continue the credit crunch, to stop people from making sensible loans.\ I'd like for us to not only have welfare reform but to re-examine the whole focus of all of our programs that help people, to shift them from entitlement programs to empowerment programs. In the end, we want people not to need us anymore. I think that's important.\ But in the end, we have to get back to the deficit. For years, there's been a lot of talk about it but very few credible efforts to deal with it, and now I understand why, having dealt with the real numbers for four weeks. But I believe this plan does. It tackles the budget deficit seriously and over the long term. It puts in place one of the biggest deficit reductions and one of the biggest changes in federal priorities from consumption to investment in the history of this country at the same time over the next four years.\ Let me say to all the people watching us tonight who will ask me these questions beginning tomorrow as I go around the country and who've asked it in the past, we're not cutting the deficit just because experts say it's the thing to do or because it has some intrinsic merit. We have to cut the deficit because the more we spend paying off the debt, the less tax dollars we have to invest in jobs, in education and the future of this country.\ And the more money we take out of the pool of available savings, the harder it is for people in the private sector to borrow money at affordable interest rates for a college loan for their children, for a home mortgage, or to start a new business. That's why we've got to reduce the debt, because it is crowding out other activities that we ought to be engaged in and that the American people ought to be engaged in.\ We cut the deficit so that our children will be able to pay for a home, so that our companies can invest in the future and in retraining their workers so that our government can make the kinds of investments we need to be a stronger and smarter and safer nation.\ If we don't act now, you and I might not even recognize this government 10 years from now. If we just stay with the same trends of the last four years, by the end of the decade the deficit will be $635 billion a year, almost 80 percent of our gross domestic product, and paying interest on that debt will be the costliest government program of all. We'll still be the world's largest debtor, and when members of Congress come here they'll be devoting our 20 cents on the dollar to interest payments, more than half of the budget to health care and to other entitlements, and you'll come here and deliberate and argue over 6 or 7 cents on the dollar, no matter what America's problems are.\ We will not be able to have the independence we need to chart the future that we must, and we'll be terribly dependent on foreign funds for a large portion of our investment.\ This budget plan, by contrast, will by 1997 cut $140 billion in that year alone from the deficit, a real spending cut, a real revenue increase, a real deficit reduction, using the independent numbers of the Congressional Budget Office. `You can laugh, Republicans'\ Well, you can laugh, my fellow Republicans, but I'll point out that the Congressional Budget Office was normally more conservative in what was going to happen and closer to right than previous presidents have been.\ I did this so that we could argue about priorities with the same set of numbers; I did this so that no one could say I was estimating my way out of this difficulty; I did this because if we can agree together on the most prudent revenues we're likely to get -- if the recovery stays and we do right things economically, then it'll turn out better for the American than we say. In the last 12 years, because there were differences over the revenue estimates, you and I know that both parties were given greater elbow room for irresponsibility. This is tightening the rein on the Democrats as well as the Republicans. Let's at least argue about the same set of numbers so the American people will think we're shooting straight with them.\ As I said earlier, my recommendation makes more than 150 difficult reductions, to cut the federal spending by a total of $246 billion. We're eliminating programs that are no longer needed, such as nuclear power research and development.\ We're slashing subsidies and canceling wasteful projects. But many of these programs were justified in their time and a lot of them were difficult for me to recommend reductions in -- some really tough ones for me personally. I recommend that we reduce interest subsidies to the Rural Electric Administration. That's a difficult thing for me to recommend, but I think that I cannot exempt the things that exist in my state or in my experience if I ask you to deal with things that are difficult for you to deal with. We're going to have to have no sacred cows except the fundamental, abiding interest of the American people.\ I have to say that we all know our government has been just great at building programs. The time has come to show the American people that we can limit them, too, that we can not only start things, but we can actually stop things. `Responsibilities around world'\ About the defense budget, I raise a hope and a caution. As we restructure our military forces to meet the new threats of the post-Cold War world, it is true that we can responsibly reduce our defense budget. And we may all doubt what that range of reductions is, but let me say that as long as I am president, I will do everything I can to make sure that the men and women who serve under the American flag will remain the best trained, the best prepared, the best equipped fighting force in the world, and every one of you should make that solemn pledge. We still have responsibilities around the world, we are the world's only superpower, this is still a dangerous and uncertain time, and we owe it to the people in uniform to make sure that we adequately provide for the national defense and for their interests and needs.\ Backed by an effective national defense and a stronger economy, our nation will be prepared to lead a world challenged as it is everywhere by ethnic conflict, by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, by the global democratic revolution and by challenges to the health of our global environment.\ I know this economic plan is ambitious, but I honestly believe it is necessary for the continued greatness of the United States. And I think it is paid for fairly, first by cutting government, then by asking the most of those who benefited the most in the past and by asking more Americans to contribute today so that all of us can prosper tomorrow.\ For the wealthiest -- those earning more than $180,000 per year -- I ask you all who are listening tonight to support a raise in the top rate for federal income taxes from 31 to 36 percent. We recommend a ten percent surtax on incomes over $250,000 a year and we recommend closing some loopholes that some people get away without paying any tax at all.\ For businesses with taxable incomes in excess of $10 million, we recommend a raise in the corporate rate, also to 36 percent, as well as a cut in the deduction for business entertainment expenses.\ Our plan seeks to attack tax subsides that actually reward companies more for shutting their operations down here and moving them overseas than for staying here and reinvesting in America. I say that as someone who believes that American companies should be free to invest around the world and as a former governor who actively sought investment of foreign companies in my state. But the tax code should not express a preference to American companies for moving somewhere else and it does in particular cases today.\ We will seek to insure that through effective tax enforcement foreign corporations who do make money in America simply pay the same taxes that American companies make on the same income. `No cuts in Medicaid'\ To middle class Americans who have paid a great deal for the last 12 years and from whom I ask a contribution tonight, I will say again, as I did on Monday, you're not going alone any more -- you're certainly not going first, and you're not going to pay more for less as you have too often in the past.\ I want to emphasize the facts about this plan: 98.8 percent of America's families will have no increase in their income tax rates, only 1.2 percent at the top.\ Let me be clear. There will also be no new cuts in benefits for Medicare.\ As we move toward the fourth year with the explosion in health care costs, as I said, projected to account for 50 percent of the growth of the deficit between now and the year 2000, there must be plan cuts in payments to providers -- to doctors, to hospitals, to labs -- as a way of controlling health care costs, but I see these only as a stopgap until we can reform the entire health care system. If you'll help me do that, we can be fair to the providers and to the consumers of health care.\ Let me repeat this, because I know it matters to a lot of you on both sides of the aisle. This plan does not make a recommendation for new cuts in Medicare benefits for any beneficiary. Secondly, the only change we are making in Social Security is one that has already been publicized: the plan does ask older Americans with higher incomes who do not rely solely on Social Security to get by to contribute more. This plan will not affect the 80 percent of Social Security recipients who do not pay taxes on Social Security now. Those who do not pay tax on Social Security now will not be affected by this plan.\ Our plan does include a broad-based tax on energy. And I want to tell you why I selected this and why I think it's a good idea. I recommend that we adopt a BTU tax on the heat content of energy as the best way to provide us with revenue to lower the deficit, because it also combats pollution, promotes energy efficiency, promotes the independence economically of this country as well as helping to reduce the debt, and because it does not discriminate against any area. Unlike a carbon tax, it's not too hard on the coal states; unlike a gas tax, it's not too tough on people who drive a long way to work; unlike an ad valorem tax, it doesn't increase just when the price of an energy source goes up. And it is environmentally responsible; it will help us in the future as well as in the present with the deficit. `Courage to start building'\ Taken together, these measures will cost an American family with an income of about $40,000 a year less than $17 a month. It will cost American families with incomes under $30,000 nothing because of other programs we propose, principally those raising the earned income tax credit.\ Because of our publicly stated determination to reduce the deficit, if we do these things, we will see the continuation of what's happened just since the election. Just since the election, since the secretary of the Treasury, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and others have begun to speak out publicly in favor of a tough deficit reduction plan, interest rates have continued to fall, long-term. That means that for the middle class, who will pay something more each month, if they have any credit needs or demands, their increased energy costs will be more than offset by lower interest costs for mortgages, consumer loans, credit cards. This can be a wise investment for them and their country now.\ I would also point out what the American people already know, and that is, because we're a big, vast country where we drive long distances, we have maintained far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country. We will still have far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country, and these will be spread fairly, with real attempts to make sure that no cost is imposed on families with incomes under $30,000, and that the costs are very modest until you get into the higher income groups where the income taxes trigger in.\ Now I ask all of you to consider this. Whatever you think of the tax program, whatever you think of the spending cuts, consider the costs of not changing. Remember the numbers that you all know. If we just keep on doing what we're doing, by the end of the decade, we'll have a $650-billion-a-year deficit. If we just keep on doing what we're doing, by the end of the decade, 20 percent of our national income will go to health care every year, twice as much as any other country on the face of the globe. If we just keep on doing what we're doing, over 20 cents on the dollar will have to go to service the debt.\ Unless we have the courage now to start building our future and stop borrowing from it, we're condemning ourselves to years of stagnation, interrupted by occasional recessions, to slow growth in jobs, to no more growth in incomes, to more debt, to more disappointment. Unless we change, unless we increase investment and reduce the debt to raise productivity so that we can generate both jobs and incomes, we will be condemning our children and our children's children to a lesser life than we enjoyed.\ Once Americans looked forward to doubling their living standards every 25 years. At present productivity rates, it'll take a hundred years to double living standards, until our grandchildren's grandchildren are born. I say that is too long to wait. `Our people will be watching'\ Tonight the American people know we have to change. But they're also likely to ask me tomorrow and all of you for the weeks and months ahead whether we have the fortitude to make the changes happen in the right way. They know that as soon as I leave this chamber and you go home, various interest groups will be out in force lobbying against this or that piece of this plan and that the forces of conventional wisdom will offer a thousand reasons why we well ought to do this but we just can't do it.\ Our people will be watching and wondering -- not to see whether you disagree with me on a particular issue but just to see whether this is going to business as usual or a real new day -- whether we're all going to conduct ourselves as if we know we're working for them. We must scale the walls of the people's skepticism, not with our words but with our deeds.\ After so many years of gridlock and indecision, after so many hopeful beginnings and so few promising results, the American people are going to be harsh in their judgments of all of us if we fail to seize this moment. This economic plan can't please everybody. If the package is picked apart, there will be something that will anger each of us and won't please anybody. But if it taken as a whole, it will help all of us.\ So I ask you all to begin by resisting the temptation to focus only a particular spending cut you don't like or some particular investment that wasn't made -- and nobody likes the tax increases -- but let's just face facts. For 20 years through administrations of both parties, incomes have stalled and debt has exploded and productivity has not grown as it should. We cannot deny the reality of our condition. We have got to play the hand we were dealt and play it as best we can.\ My fellow Americans, the test of this plan cannot be what is in it for me; it has got to be what is in it for us.\ If we work hard and if we work together, if we rededicate ourselves to creating jobs, to rewarding work, to strengthening our families, to reinvesting our government, we can lift our country's fortunes again. Today I ask everyone in this chamber and every American to look simply into your heart, to spark your own hopes, to fire your own imagination. There is so much good, so much possibility, so much excitement in this country now that if we act boldly and honestly, as leaders should, our legacy will be one of prosperity and progress. This must be America's new direction. Let us summon the courage to seize it.\ Thank you. God bless America."
226," CHICAGO -- Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton accused Democratic presidential rival Paul Tsongas yesterday of wanting to pound the middle class ""into the dirt"" in a testy debate in which the candidates repeatedly slapped one another on economic and tax policy.\ Mr. Clinton lashed out at Mr. Tsongas after the former Massachusetts senator suggested Mr. Clinton's proposed middle-class tax cut was ""candy"" to voters at a time when the nation needed sacrifice.\ Mr. Clinton, who leads in polls in both states, not surprisingly drew the most fire. He shot back that Mr. Tsongas was the race's ""Santa Claus for the rich,"" offering the wealthy a capital gains tax cut while refusing to give tax fairness to the middle class.\ The debate came just four days before Illinois and Michigan vote Tuesday in primaries that will decide whether Mr. Clinton, the front-runner, sprints away from the Democratic pack.\ The three Democratic candidates sparred over crime and drugs, industrial policy and how best to bring jobs to union workers and inner-city neighborhoods.\ Former California Gov. Jerry Brown repeatedly bid for labor support, criticizing his Democratic rivals and President Bush for supporting a free-trade agreement with Mexico that Mr. Brown said would cost U.S. jobs and exploit Mexico's workers and environment.\ Mr. Brown also accused Mr. Clinton of promoting ""slave labor"" in his right-to-work state during economic development missions to Korea.\ But the sharpest exchange of the night came as Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton escalated their increasingly acerbic economic debate for statewide television audiences in both Illinois and Michigan.\ ""What this country needs is a leader who will say to them, `No more candy, no more Santa Claus,' ""Mr. Tsongas said in a remark clearly aimed at Mr. Clinton.\ Pointing to Mr. Tsongas, Mr. Clinton retorted: ""He wants to continue to pound the middle class and lower middle class into the dirt. . . . He wants to give the rich something and punish the working class."" As evidence, he cited Mr. Tsongas' plan to raise the gas tax 50 cents over the next 10 years and give the wealthy a capital gains tax reduction.\ Mr. Tsongas in Texas last week said the gas-tax money would be used to finance tax credits for energy producers. But in yesterday's debate he said the money would be used for infrastructure that would benefit Illinois and Michigan.\ The free-for-all came during the second half of a fast-moving 60-minute debate broadcast by CBS affiliates in both industrial states.\ Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton quoted Scripture and criticized President Bush for making welfare a ""whipping boy"" as he courted black voters who could prove crucial in next week's Midwestern presidential primaries. He visited a black church outside Detroit and an inner-city school in Chicago\ Mr. Tsongas, touting his endorsement by the Chicago Tribune, stuck to his economic message as he visited with senior citizens in Chicago.\ Mr. Brown, too, stressed economic themes, starting his day outside a Chicago auto parts factory that moved to Mexico.\ ""These people -- good, hard-working Americans -- have been ripped off, have been lied to and their jobs taken to Mexico,"" he declared. ""I am here to stop that.""\ A poll of Michigan voters released yesterday by the Michigan State University Institute for Public Policy and Social Research showed 34 percent of Democrats favoring Mr. Clinton, 19 percent for Mr. Tsongas and 10 percent for Mr. Brown, with 37 percent undecided. The telephone survey, conducted Sunday through Thursday, had a margin of error of plus or minus 7 percentage points."
227," Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. sought the support of General Assembly leaders yesterday for a moderate but incomplete legislative agenda that left lawmakers hungry for specifics about the state's most pressing issues.\ Democratic and Republican lawmakers who met with Ehrlich at the State House said he all but ruled out proposing an increase in the state's 23.5-cent -a-gallon gasoline tax as he outlined measures he hopes to enact this year to protect the Chesapeake Bay, reduce crime and lower the cost of health care.\ ""He said that takes more political capital than we have,"" said Del. Kumar Barve of Montgomery County, the House majority leader. ""Without actually driving a stake through its heart, he ruled it out.""\ Lawmakers said the governor promised to find other ways to meet the state's transportation revenue needs, which a high-profile commission put at $300 million a year.\ That issue, slot machines and a plan to fully fund the Thornton education formula were the three items most conspicuously absent from the wish list the governor outlined yesterday.\ Most of the items in the governor's package had previously been announced. They address issues including malpractice awards, ethics and a new fee to upgrade sewage-treatment plants.\ Matthew Crenson, a political science professor at the Johns Hopkins University, said the agenda is not only middle-of-the-road, but also modest.\ ""There's a lot of white space here,"" he said. ""It's difficult to characterize as liberal or conservative because there's not very much here.""\ Ehrlich's Republican allies expressed optimism that the governor's plans would be adopted by a Democratic-controlled legislature. A year ago, the Assembly rejected much of the legislation proposed by a governor who had taken office weeks earlier.\ Del. Anthony J. O'Donnell, the House minority whip, said Ehrlich is better-positioned than his predecessors to make gains on the environment, community development and other areas.\ ""Many of these areas have been talked about for decades, but scant progress has been made,"" O'Donnell said. ""The difference is that a Republican governor can make it happen, and walk the walk and not just talk the talk.""\ During the meeting, lawmakers asked the governor when he would introduce his slots bill.\ ""He said he was tired of talking about it,"" said Sen. Patrick J. Hogan, a Montgomery County Democrat. ""He did say next week.""\ Hogan, vice chairman of the Budget and Taxation Committee, said he also pressed the governor for an assurance that he would put forward a plan to raise the revenue recommended by a panel headed by former Transportation Secretary William K. Hellmann. Hogan said Ehrlich promised he would.\ ""I hope they get the details soon because we're running out of time,"" said Hogan, a Montgomery County Democrat.\ Ruling out a gas tax increase leaves Ehrlich with only a few items on the ""menu"" of revenue choices prepared by his Transportation Department. Most prominent among them are a rise in registration fees and an increase in the titling tax from 5 percent to 6 percent.\ Montgomery County Executive Douglas M. Duncan said it will be difficult for Ehrlich to come up with $300 million a year without a gas tax increase.\ ""It's just very frustrating. There's no leadership here. There's a transportation crisis in this state, and he's making it worse,"" said Duncan, a potential Democratic challenger in 2006.\ Bob Peck, president of the Greater Washington Board of Trade, said the gas tax could find its way back onto the table before the session's end. ""When you look at the other options, they look at least as politically unpalatable or they don't come close to raising as much money as we need,"" he said.\ Senate Minority Leader J. Lowell Stoltzfus said a registration fee increase could be acceptable to Republicans, especially if the payment schedule is changed so bills are due yearly.\ Drivers of passenger vehicles now pay $81 every two years. The change Stotzfus is suggesting would mean that if the fee were raised $30 a year, as suggested by the Maryland Chamber of Commerce, drivers would have to write a $70.50 check every year.\ Some leading Democrats oppose reliance on the fee because it affects infrequent drivers as much as long-distance commuters and doesn't bring in revenue from out-of-state drivers. They have warned that they will label any large increase in registration fees a ""car tax.""\ During the meeting, Ehrlich received a blunt warning that the majority Democrats in the Senate will not bring any administration- supported revenue bills to a floor vote if he fails to deliver the support of Republican lawmakers. Democrats said that when they supported administration fee bills last year, they were criticized by Republicans for raising ""taxes.""\ The Ehrlich agenda\ Environment\ Establish a Chesapeake Bay Watershed Fund to upgrade 66 large sewage-treatment plans. The $750 million to $1 billion fund would be supported by a $2.50-per-household monthly charge on sewer bills.\ Set up a Chesapeake Bay Recovery Fund, under which nonprofit groups would be asked to support restoration projects.\ Eliminate a requirement that farmers grant a right of entry to state inspectors as part of the state's nutrient management program.\ Crime\ Create a diversion system that would steer more offenders in cases of nonviolent crime to drug and alcohol treatment program.\ Strengthen penalties for witness intimidation.\ Allow the death penalty in cases where a witness or victim in a case is killed.\ Economy\ Extend until 2010 the Rehabilitation Tax Credit Program, which has been credited with sparking a revitalization of older sections of Baltimore and other cities. Commercial credits would be limited to a total of $30 million a year. The credit for each owner- occupied residential project would be limited to $50,000.\ Eliminate a loophole in the corporate income tax law that allows companies to escape taxation by setting up Delaware holding companies.\ Expand the state's brownfields program for the cleanup and reuse of contaminated industrial sites.\ Health\ Limit economic awards in malpractice cases to actual costs to victims and spread payments over time. Create incentives for victims to settle before trial. Limit pain and suffering awards at $500,000, down from the current $635,000 but more than the $350,000 urged by doctors.\ Create a capital bond program to finance federally qualified health centers to provide care for uninsured Marylanders.\ Create a Cabinet-level Department of Disabilities.\ Ethics\ Eliminate the automatic stay granted to lobbyists so that they can appeal to the courts any sanctions imposed by the state Ethics Commission.\ - Compiled by Michael Dresser and Meredith Cohn\ Credit: SUN STAFF"
228,"West side plan would suburbanize historic city district\One needs only glance at the sketch of the proposed Howard Street USA project to see what an affront that project would be, in its present form, to the character of downtown Baltimore (""Parking demands fuel project debate,"" April 1).\""Honolulu Harry"" Weinberg, the worst of absentee landlords, neglected the historic west-side buildings he owned.\Now the Owings Mills-based Weinberg Foundation wants to add insult to injury by demolishing those buildings and many others to inflict on our city the tackiest sort of suburban-style mall.\Do we really want national chain stores on the west side, when that would mean the displacement of homegrown and minority-owned small businesses?\Do we want to attract suburbanites and tourists, when that would mean driving out the people of West Baltimore who patronize those businesses?\What we really need is ""Howard Street Baltimore"" which would be a district of restored buildings housing and serving the area's present merchants and consumers, to whom the area really belongs.\If downtown Baltimore is to become Owings Mills, we might as well move to the suburbs.\John Maclay, Baltimore\It's sad that The Sun has endorsed the Weinberg Foundation's west side renewal plan (""Time to get going on west side revival,"" editorial, April 2). By doing so it is supporting a land-grab that is bound to be a social and economic disaster.\Opposition to the plan is based on a sound belief that the west side can be revitalized by building on its strengths as a multi- cultural shopping district with a fine collection of historic structures.\If we add to this better policing strategies, more promotion of inexpensive loft spaces and investment in small-scale shops, Baltimore could have a west side with the flavor of Georgetown or Philadelphia's Old City historic district.\The Weinberg plan is based on the spurious belief that suburban shoppers will come downtown to spend money at the same Starbucks and Old Navy stores they see at their local mall.\And, as for the notion that young urbanites will flock to the area, there is no proof that they want to shop at a new version of The Avenue at White Marsh.\Most disturbing, however, is the plan's unwillingness to take into account the social implications of gentrifying a multi-cultural, working class shopping district through condemnation and demolition.\Such tactics may leave scars that will never heal.\I hope that The Sun reconsiders its endorsement of the west side plan. We need this newspaper to stand up for reasonable development, not short-sighted schemes.\Richard Chambers Jr., Glen Burnie\City's zoo should remain an oasis of tranquility\I was dismayed to read about proposed changes to the Baltimore Zoo (""Better life for man, beast at heart of zoo plan,"" March 31.) Rather than focus on what makes the zoo unique, planners seem to want to pander to a fast-paced sensibility.\In this age of over-stimulation, it is inappropriate to turn this urban oasis into a theme park.\I try to take my son to the zoo at least once a week. As city dwellers, this is the only place we're guaranteed a safe, tranquil stroll. My son enjoys the fresh air. I appreciate the beautiful, historic elements.\The zoo should use its funds to continue updating this historic treasure. It should improve attractions on its back road and add access to the Waterfowl Lake, woodland pathways and free concerts for children on the front lawn while repairing stone walls and fences.\I consider membership to the zoo one of the best investments we've made. and one of the top reasons I enjoy city living.\Please maintain the zoo's history and dignity.\Patricia Wise, Baltimore\Stop pandering to Cuban exiles\It's tragic that what should be a simple, compassionate, common sense reunion of a 6-year-old with his surviving parent has turned into a political nightmare.\For far too long, the small Cuban exile community has held American foreign policy hostage. Their understandable but increasingly anachronistic anti-Castro obsession has become, in fact, both anti-American and anti-Cuban.\It's also tragic that so few political leaders, including both probable presidential nominees, have the courage to stand on principle and for our nation's best interests on this issue,\If they stopped pandering to this rabid special interest group, politicians might be surprised at how astute they'd look.\Roger C.

To rely on renewable energy sources, such as solar power, is to live in a dream world.\The real culprit in poisoning the atmosphere is fossil fuels -- oil and coal. The risks of conventional fossil-fueled power stations are considerably greater than those of nuclear power plants.\The safety and environmental record of Western, non-Chernobyl nuclear power has been remarkable.\Using more nuclear power will reduce the threat to our security from dependence on imported oil and the threat to our environment from the use of fossil fuels.\Bernard Siegel, Baltimore\Other Jewish groups also embrace same-sex unions\As part of the Leadership Conference of Secular and Humanistic Jews, I applaud the Reform rabbis' decision to affirm same-sex marriage (""Reform Judaism to vote on gay union sanction,"" March 26).\The Reform movement joins not only the Reconstructionist movement, but also the secular humanistic Jewish movement in celebrating and upholding such unions.\In fact, since the Leadership Conference of Secular Humanistic Jews first ordained clergy almost 15 years ago, we have been performing such weddings\Judith Seid, Towson"
229," NO new taxes has been the mantra of the Republican party ever since George Bush said ""Read my lips"" in 1988, then raised taxes and lost the next election.\ But no one says anything about fees.\ Like his GOP colleagues - and virtually all Democrats who want to win an election - Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. promises no new taxes. But he has made fees a big part of getting more money from citizens without uttering the words ""tax increase.""\ With few exceptions, voters seem to give these fees a free ride. ""They are just not on the psychological radar screen like taxes,"" says Donald F. Norris, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\ In raising fees, Maryland is no exception to what experts say is a nationwide trend.\ This year, Ehrlich has proposed increasing car registration fees by $23.50 a year - $36 for sport utility vehicles - to finance road projects. A $30 each year addition to water bills would go for sewage treatment plant upgrades.\ Fishing licenses would cost $8 more, boat registration another $16. Many other increases are hidden in departmental budgets that include requests for permission to increase various fees to raise more income. The Motor Vehicle Administration is looking for $21 million more in unspecified boosts to fees such as those charged for driver's licenses.\ ""This is very common,"" says David Brunori, a professor at George Washington University law school who is head of editorial operations at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit publishing company. ""There has certainly been in the last quarter-century a decided anti-tax bias in state government. There have been some exceptions, but in general political leaders in both parties have [been afraid] to raise broad base taxes - sales, income or property.""\ Fees became an alternative source.\ ""They invented a million and one ways to collect fees, sometimes just to avoid calling them taxes,"" says economics professor Jonathan Hamilton of the University of Florida.\ Florida is considered particularly inventive at coming up with fees as it has no income tax and it would be political suicide to suggest imposing one.\ So, is there a difference between a tax and a fee? Well, yes - and no.\ Economists say that properly levied and administered, fees can bring an efficiency to government that broad-based taxes cannot. ""The appeal of fees is that they are typically tailored toward the cost of providing that specific service,"" says Mahlon Straszheim of the University of Maryland, College Park. ""If the government charged for services based more on the cost of those services, the whole financial system would be more efficient.""\ The idea is that fees can introduce the discipline of the marketplace to the financing of government.\ ""There are two aspects to it,"" says Steve H. Hanke of the Johns Hopkins University. ""The user pays and finances at least in part some of what he uses. ... So those who benefit pay. And the price is used, at least in part, to ration the use of whatever it is the public is using. This eliminates, or at least mitigates, the use of political pull in deciding what services the government offers.""\ He notes things such as water meters and admission at the zoo as examples of user fees that confer the benefit of a free market on a government service.\ But as Christopher D. Carroll of Hopkins notes, to work in this way, the consumer must have some choice - such as in how much water to use or whether to go to the zoo. ""It really depends on whether the things that the government is charging fees for are things people can choose not to do,"" he says. ""If it is things people can't avoid, then basically it is like imposing a tax.""\ Voluntary charges\ Some fee increases proposed by the Ehrlich administration meet this criterion - you can choose whether it is worth the extra money to buy a fishing license. But others probably do not. The addition to the water bill is not voluntary. If you have a car, you have to register it. Those are more like taxes.\ Then there is the aspect whether the fee is going to support the service. The boat-slip charge seems to meet this test - state officials say the $2 million it is expected to raise will go the Maryland Department of the Environment's Wetlands and Waterways Program.\ But it is not as clear for the auto registration fee. It will go to pay for roads. Those costs are not unrelated to registered cars, but it would be a much clearer relationship if the money were going to pay for the costs of reg istering cars.\ In fact, one fee does have a much closer correlation with road costs - the tax added to the price of a gallon of gasoline, which is the primary means of funding road projects. ""The gas tax is clearly a better charge than the vehicle fee,"" says Straszheim of Maryland. ""It is directly related to how much gas you are using so approximately to how many miles are driven and the weight of the vehicle. So there is a very good reason that gas taxes are the centerpiece of road financing.""\ But there is one major difference - raising the gas tax, like the sales tax, or income tax, carries a huge political liability. For some reason, raising something like the car registration fee does not.\ Partly, it is just the name. ""It's called a tax, but you could also call it a fee,"" Straizheim says of the gas tax. ""It is happenstance that it came to be called a tax.""\ The narrowly tailored fees - aimed only at boat owners or fishermen or nursing homes - make it more difficult to raise large- scale opposition.\ ""It's hard to get people excited about fees,"" says Hamilton of Florida.\ Small amounts, less ire\ People also tend to see fees more as nuisance payments than as taxes. ""The dollar amounts of user fees and charges - except maybe college tuition - are small enough that it makes it politically palatable to get away with it,"" Brunori says. ""You increase car registration by $20 or $25 and the individual doesn't have sticker shock over that. They may gripe, but they are not going to be marching around Annapolis.""\ The fact that the fees are seen as paying for a specific benefit work in their favor.\ ""People somehow have this vague impression that they don't know what happened to their income tax payment,"" Hamilton says. ""Even though they have schools for their kids and a million other things, they somehow don't make the connection. But they are delighted to pay into a fund that is going to pay for something specific.""\ Fees also hit the most vocal voters - the wealthy - the least because citizens pay the same to register an old jalopy as a brand new car, or for a fishing license no matter what your income.\ ""Rich people would much rather pay a $30 sewage fee than see a proportional increase in their property or income tax,"" says Hamilton, though he notes that fees are actually more expensive for some taxpayers because, unlike income or property taxes, they are not deductible on federal income taxes.\ Slots as taxes?\ The taxes that get politicians in trouble are either the small ones that people seem to be paying all the time - sales and gas taxes - or the big ones they pay once a year - income and property.\ But the bottom line on fees and taxes is that ultimately it's the government taking your money. The same is true of the other way Ehrlich hopes to raise state revenue - slots.\ ""It is basically a tax,"" says Straizheim of slots. ""It is directing peoples' consumption away from other goods into this activity and then taxing it heavily. And the people betting are by and large the poor and the elderly.""\ Carroll says, ""There is a great line that applies to all debates about taxes"" that helps explain why fees are not as unpopular.\ ""'Don't tax you, don't tax me, tax that guy behind the tree,'"" he recites. ""User fees get the guys behind the trees. That's especially true in the case of hunting licenses, I guess.""\ Credit: SUN STAFF"

Judge shopping
\
Your front-page article on ""judge shopping"" in the District Court (The Sunday Capital, June 27) should be read by every county voter. It is a problem they can help correct in the November election.
\
Judge shopping occurs when a lawyer demands a jury trial on the day of a District Court criminal trial. A jury demand bumps the case up to the Circuit Court. As the article said, if ""the District Court judge is known to give out harsh sentences, attorneys will advise their clients to take it up to the Circuit Court instead.""
\
Don't blame lawyers. Lawyers universally consider our Circuit Court judges to be more lenient than some of our District Court judges and lawyers have a duty to get the best result for their clients.
\
But, as the article said, ""prosecutors complain last-minute postponements and jury trial prayers inconvenience witnesses and lower the public's perception of the judiciary by forcing citizens to come to court several times."" These victims and witnesses, including police officers, feel abused.
\
Your article stated that of ""the average 100 jury trial requests each month, very few actually end up before a jury. Most end in guilty pleas, court trials or dismissals"" in the Circuit Court. There simply are not enough judges to hear that many trials. So prosecutors with missing witnesses or lenient Circuit Court judges are forced to make plea bargains.
\
One solution: Elect a tough judge to our Circuit Court in November. The last judge on the court perceived by lawyers to impose tough criminal sentences retired in 2001.
\
Voters will elect three Circuit Court judges on Nov. 2. I am one of the five candidates on the ballot. Please visit my Web site at goetzke4judge.com for additional information.

Raps council
\
I was disgusted that our County Council gave $1.1 million to the Maryland Economic Development Corp. to finish Compass Pointe Golf Course.
\
The council gave MEDCO this money interest-free, with no guarantee that it would be paid back.
\
MEDCO asked for this free taxpayer money so that its investors won't have to refinance their loan and suffer a loss on their investment.
\
This really disturbs me because, three years ago, MEDCO promised the County Council that this golf course would not cost the county a dime.
\
I am sure MEDCO, along with greedy developers, will be back many more times for more free money.
\
This County Council needs to get its priorities in order. Why should the completion of a golf course take precedence over a fire station on the Annapolis Neck, repairing schools or repairing roads, and many other worthwhile projects?
\
To me, a bunch of people trying to hit a little white ball into a hole in the ground are not that important.
\
The last two County Councils have been nothing but loyists for the greedy developers. They have had a negative impact on our quality of life and have done irreversible damage to the environment.
\
Thanks to the two-term limitation law, we will be getting rid of Councilmen Pamela Beidle, D-Linthicum, and Bill Burlison, D- Odenton, plus County Executive Janet Owens.
\
I hope that in the next election the voters will get rid of Councilmen Cathleen Vitale, R-Severna Park; Ron Dillon, R-Pasadena; Ed Reilly, R-Crofton; and Ed Middlebrooks, R-Severn.
\
I would like to see some good, honest, trustworthy people come forward and start running for public office. I'm sick and tired of having to vote for the lesser of two evils.

Media bias
\
The liberal media have long deliberately put their slant on what they release to the public. The only news you hear about Iraq is bad news and casualty reports. We never hear about the hundreds of schools, hospitals and markets now open and the newfound freedom of speech and religion.
\
Recently, a misguided person wrote about John Kerry, the ultimate decision-maker. No doubt she parroted the headlines of some liberal newspaper and didn't research how Mr. Kerry loied for an 80-cent Massachusetts gas tax, but now claims he opposes taxes. Perhaps she never read about how Mr. Kerry voted for the invasion of Iraq, but now opposes the war.
\
A radio talk show recently reported that when the liberal producer of ""Fahrenheit 9-11"" was asked about his production and its authenticity, he responded, ""Americans are very stupid people."" The inference may be that if they believe this nonsense, so be it.
\
A co-worker of mine was under the impression that the economy was bad because he heard this on the news. When I explained to him all the factors that show the economy is booming, he was surprised. He said this is not what the media reported.
\
It is time for Americans to wake up and think for themselves and not let the media think for them. That's what happened to Germany when Hitler controlled the media. We all know what happened there.

Soldiers' duty

A recent letter writer (Readers' views, July 3) seems not to understand the very nature of our Army. Soldiers may agree or not agree with U.S. foreign policy, but it is their sworn duty to carry out their orders.

If we invaded Iraq because it was a breeding ground to train terrorists, then we have failed miserably. No sane person can possibly think there are now fewer terrorists in Iraq than before the invasion.

I support the troops and I believe their civilian leadership is sorely lacking.

231," ANNAPOLIS -- Ten-year Carroll Del. Lawrence A. LaMotte says the 1992 General Assembly session has been unequivocally the most unpleasant he's experienced.\ The quarrelsome legislature couldn't agree on budget or tax proposals before Monday's conclusion of the 90-day session. It was forced into an extended session to enact a ""doomsday"" budget containing severe reductions.\ The legislature finally agreed on a budget Friday evening, then was called into a special session by Gov. William Donald Schaefer to deal with three tax bills necessary to avoid further spending cuts.\ ""I think we look like fools because we couldn't do it in 90 days,"" said LaMotte, a Democrat.\ LaMotte had expected by Tuesday to be heading back to rejoin his family, catching up on rest and resuming his career as a financial planner. But instead he felt like a man heading for a guillotine.\ ""No matter what we do, we'll be viciously criticized"" by an angry public that has lost tolerance for government, LaMotte said.\ Carroll Sen. Charles H. Smelser, a state legislator for 34 years, says he can't recall a tougher session than this year's. The Democrat serves on the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee, which was responsible for cutting the budget or forming tax proposals to make up for a revenue shortfall.\ ""It was difficult particularly in view of the hours we spent on the budget,"" he said. ""We'd go 8 {a.m.} to 11 {p.m.}.""\ Many Carroll constituents opposed tax increases, said county legislators. Groups that included teachers, PTA activists and advocates for the poor urged the legislators to consider whether their anti-tax votes would result in damaging consequences.\ Carroll's six legislators remained firmly against any new taxes throughout the budget-dominated session. Carroll Dels. Richard C. Matthews and Donald B. Elliott participated on the 26-member House Republican Caucus, which offered a no-tax budget proposal.\ However, LaMotte said he would reconsider his position during a special session, predicting he would be unable to support some budget cuts in good conscience.\ The following is a look at how the legislators focused their efforts during the 90-day session and how they fared on their own initiatives.\ Del. Richard N. Dixon, D-Carroll: Dixon served on the House Appropriations Committee, which whittled down the budget, and chaired a committee on pensions.\ The stockbroker sponsored a bill with the appropriations chairman creating an early retirement incentive program for state employees with at least 25 years of service.\ The bill, which passed, is designed to save money for the state and reduce its work force through attrition.\ He vowed to return with more bills to protect citizens against potential mining damages. A House committee tabled for interim study three of Dixon's bills intended to balance citizens' concerns with competing mining interests and killed another Dixon bill that would have presumed mining companies liable for land depressions near their quarries.\ The General Assembly enacted Dixon's bill which would require the Motor Vehicle Administration to expunge driving violations of certain drivers who maintain clean records for three years.\ Del. Donald B. Elliott, R-Carroll, Howard: One Elliott bill already has been signed by the governor and enacted into law. Intended to save money, it requires the state to recover and redistribute durable medical equipment, such as wheelchairs, from Medical Assistance Program recipients.\ He also succeeded in passing a consumer-protection measure for the hearing-impaired, allowing them to cancel purchases of hearing aids within 30 days for any reason.\ His effort to make it a crime to be a spectator at cockfights passed the House, but was killed in the Senate by a 5-5 committee vote.\ He vowed to continue next year his battle to compel the Department of Human Resources to change the way it handles records of those who are wrongly accused of child or adult abuse. Two bills he sponsored this year didn't pass.\ Del. Richard C. Matthews, R-Carroll: The chairman of the Carroll delegation, Matthews was responsible for shepherding the county commissioners' bills through the legislature.\ His measures to toughen penalties for drunken driving, limit plea bargaining for violent crimes and create a central registry for judges' decisions were rejected by the House Judiciary Committee on which he serves.\ Del. Lawrence A. LaMotte, D-Carroll, Baltimore: LaMotte advised several committees on health insurance legislation, hospital administration and health budget matters. He worked on money-saving revisions for the state's burgeoning Medicaid program, which finances health care for the poor.\ He was disappointed at the negative reception for his growth-management bill, which had tougher compliance provisions than a similar bill introduced by the Schaefer administration. He withdrew the bill.\ Sen. Charles H. Smelser, D-Carroll, Frederick, Howard: Smelser concentrated on the state's operating and capital budgets. He chairs the Senate's Capital Budget subcommittee.\ Upon request, he worked with four other senators who were interested in making deeper cuts in the budget. Some of the impromptu group's recommendations were accepted by the Budget and Taxation Committee, leading to about $50 million in additional cuts, said Smelser.\ Smelser said he perceives that a coalition of legislators from Baltimore City and Montgomery and Prince George's counties are wielding too much influence. They are seeking money and other favors from the state, which could leave smaller counties with less, he said.\ Sen. Larry E. Haines, R-Carroll, Baltimore: Haines' attempt to amend Maryland's constitution by guaranteeing individuals the right to keep and bear arms failed by a narrow vote in the Senate.\ His measure designed to protect home buyers and sellers by requiring that a form disclosing a property's condition be given to prospective purchasers failed in the House after passing the Senate.\ He succeeded in passing a bill intended to save money for counties by changing the way fees for filing certain court documents are collected.\ STATUS OF CARROLL COUNTY'S DELEGATION PACKAGE\ Bill Description of proposed legislation Status (as of Friday)\ HB 395 Make it a misdemeanor to be a spectator at cockfights or dogfights (Elliott)Killed by Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, 5-5\ HB 425Request $500,000 from the state for Carroll County General Hospital's upgrade and expansion (Dixon)Killed by House Appropriations Committee\ HB 892 Require social-service agencies to expunge records of adult abuse investigations within three years (House) or 120 days (Senate) in absence of supporting evidence (Elliott)Full house tabled compromise measure\ SB 738 Prohibit amendments in state's pay plan for employees and job reclassifications, June 1 to June 30, 1993 (Smelser)Died in Senate Budget and Taxation Committee\ SOURCE: General Assembly Legislative Reference Service\ HOW CARROLL'S LEGISLATORS VOTED ON KEY ISSUES IN 1992\ Topic Description of legislation ..

232," GOV. ROBERT L. Ehrlich Jr. has changed the culture of Annapolis. His arrival has made it a far more partisan place, a more divided and more contentious place.\ His determination to assert GOP values - and why not, after 36 years out of the governor's mansion? - makes him the change agent. In some ways, the adjustment will be therapeutic; in others, less so.\ When Democrats were in complete control of both houses and the governor's office, they could concentrate on problem-solving with no political concerns. So what if they were busting the budget. Democratic incumbents usually won. Cooperation between the Democratic executive and legislative branches raised all political boats. With notable exceptions, Republicans weren't even afterthoughts. They cast protest votes, hurled rhetorical grenades and lamented the absence of depth in their candidate pools.\ Then Mr. Ehrlich won. Even that didn't immediately disturb the Democrats. Before last year's General Assembly session, Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. told businessmen, legislators and lobbyists that the Assembly would work with Mr. Ehrlich - because, Mr. Miller said, the new governor had run as a Democrat.\ It was a clever, slightly barbed shot at Mr. Ehrlich's moderate campaign spin. But it reflected the Assembly's traditional desire to do well without controversy, to cooperate, declare victory and go home with the pork.\ But campaigns aren't always good predictors of governing style, tone or philosophy. The Republican governor turned out to be a Republican.\ And he quickly found himself in the vortex of the new partisan climate. The Assembly scotched his slot machine gambling bill, a feat turned by the House. His nominee for secretary of the environment was scuttled by a Senate committee.\ Mr. Ehrlich fired back at the end of the session, vetoing a handful of bills, including two or three tax measures. He had promised to be a bipartisan executive, but that promise ignored an important fact: The Assembly had seldom been partisan. It didn't have to be. Democrats were invulnerable, and they were always more conservative than party labels indicated: They could be more like Republicans when that suited them.\ As a result, Maryland enjoyed a government more fully devoted to pure problem-solving than many realized. That was usually a good thing, but over time, that luxury became a liability, as when a ponderous new commitment to public education put $1.3 billion on the shoulders of taxpayers. That big commitment came after income taxes were cut 10 percent. When fiscal leaders were asked how they would pay the bills, Democrats said cheerily, ""Don't worry. Be happy. We'll figure it out.""\ Then suddenly some of these leaders, including Baltimore's Sen. Barbara A. Hoffman, were gone, voted out in a changing of the guard driven by the aspirations of black voters and by the politicization of redistricting. As they had done with the education aid, the Democrats went too far. The courts took over and drew districts that were actually a challenge for many, including Ms. Hoffman and House Speaker Casper R. Taylor Jr. Both lost.\ Democrats also handed their gubernatorial nomination to someone who had never won a race for anything. So certain were they of victory, they ended up squandering a huge voter-registration edge and giving the State House to Mr. Ehrlich.\ Neither side has fully adjusted to the new reality. Republicans have to learn how to govern. Democrats have to learn about life outside the executive suite.\ The loss of a more constructive atmosphere is lamentable. Though a wealthy state - capable of solving many pressing problems - Maryland faces enormous challenges: a more than $700 million budget deficit, for example. That problem should pull the sides into the conference room, but so far it has not.\ Because he has ruled out increasing the sales or income taxes, Mr. Ehrlich cannot offer the kinds of blandishments that governors wield to get their way. Many will say that's a very good thing. But it increases the likelihood of hardened political lines: If politicians can't bargain for stuff to take home to their constituents, the cost of playing gross political games comes down. Mr. Ehrlich's own GOP stalwarts in the Assembly make things difficult for him because they fear attacks from the anti-tax cabal and resist even a critically important boost in the gas tax.\ Another campaign could actually help with all of this. Before it arrives, Mr. Ehrlich will rummage through the campaign closet for his moderate political wardrobe. He'll have to move back toward the Democratic positions referred to so wryly by Mr. Miller.\ So, in this holiday season, we can contemplate gridlock and hope for a brighter new year - in 2006.\ C.

233," Question of the Month\ June's question asked whether energy production can cure our power woes without doing unacceptable damage to the environment, and how readers would be willing to change their lives to become more energy- efficient.\ Fossil fuels can't power our future\ The Bush administration's answer to our energy requirements relies almost entirely on increased production of fossil fuels and minimizes the importance both of conservation and of using alternative and renewable sources of energy.\ This program is exactly backward. Our total oil reserves are estimated to last less than 100 years. Once they are consumed, there will never be any more.\ Unless we conserve what we have, and hold down the growth of consumption, no amount of drilling will make a difference.\ James M. Beatty St. Thomas, Pa.\ The Earth's limited endowments of oil and natural gas will soon be exhausted. To increase production now, as the Bush administration proposes, will merely hasten the inevitable.. The biblical Joseph urged pharaoh to fill granaries with the surplus of the seven fat years against the lean years to follow.\ A modern-day Joseph might urge that the proceeds from an energy tax that drives the cost of a gallon of gasoline into the $3-to-$5 range be used to expand whatever remains of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That could alleviate the worst of the coming shortages. at least temporarily.\ Prices could be allowed to rise gradually while people adjust to car pools, energy-efficient vehicles, public transportation and reduced distances from home to work.\ Public policy can neither prevent nor long delay the transition to alternative fuels. It can, however limit the collateral damage. Gradually increasing energy taxes would cover the expense as fairly and painlessly as possible.\ Jim Case, Baltimore\ Energy woes? What energy woes? Talk to me when gas hits $5 a gallon. Only then will most Americans change their behavior.\ We continue to enjoy some of the cheapest energy in the world. Unfortunately, the price we pay in no way reflects it's true cost.\ If the companies that provide us with energy were required to do so without damaging the environment, including completely cleaning up after their mistakes, then that would better reflect the true cost of the energy we use.\ Yes, it would require our economy to shift from what we are comfortable with. But we would be moving toward sustainable living, and using efficient market dynamics to make the right decisions.\ Ben Kyger, Ellicott City\ Oil men have so stake in developing alternative energy sources. This nation does.\ Rational minds have long acknowledged that a non-renewable energy source such as oil, will eventually dry up and other energy sources must be developed.\ And there is every reason to believe that our world free enterprise system can and will, if pushed by markets and government, develop environmentally safe and superior alternative energy resources.\ James P. Scherr, Pasadena\ Every penny on the federal gas tax raises about a $1 billion a year. If you drive a car, you can afford a penny a gallon more.\ How about spending $1 billion dollars a year to fund research on energy efficiency, such as reducing the 10 percent loss in all electricity sent over wire, and on renewable energy sources?\ And according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, increasing average fuel efficiency from 24 to 39 miles per gallon over the next 10 years would save 51 billion barrels of oil.\ So don't buy a vehicle that gets less than 27 miles per gallon. Your children will thank you, as they will be able to breathe when they grow up.\ Laurie Taylor-Mitchell, Towson\ Careful research and evaluation will determine the urgency of oil drilling and expanding current energy production. But protecting our environment must remain the most important criterion.\ Bill Arwady, Towson\ The answer to our energy woes is to become self-sufficient, but not by screwing up the environment looking for oil or pressuring OPEC.\ The answers are fuel cells and solar power.\ Fuel cells are already in use, powering a shuttle bus at Los Angeles International Airport, a 553-room hotel in Irvine, Calif. and other buildings,\ In Japan, solar power has been used to air-condition buildings. So why not here? Because gutless politicians kowtow to the oil lobby, which funds their campaigns.\ Our focus as a nation and world leader should be clean energy. Energy that doesn't pollute the air you and I breathe or the water we drink. Energy provided by fuel cells and solar power.\ Let's keep oil where it belongs - in the ground.\ Kevin Estis, Baltimore\ Behavior changes and technological fixes can buy us time for a transition to renewable energy and save individuals money.\ However, I doubt efficiency measures will be widely adopted until financial incentives are greater. Fossil fuels are artificially cheap. When I buy a gallon of gas, the cost of roads, pollution, and health consequences are mostly not included in the price, but borne by everyone.\ Thus I favor a shift from payroll and income taxes to taxes on fossil fuel use or carbon emissions. This would reward and encourage conservation and reduce our trade deficit. Less of our energy budget would go to OPEC and we'd keep more in tax revenue.\ Pam Garrettson, Catonsville\ Fossil fuels such as oil and coal are nonrenewable resources, meaning that they will run out some time. This means using fossil fuels is not a long-term answer to our energy woes.\ And using and obtaining fossil fuels causes air and water pollution, global warming, erosion and destroys natural habitats, regardless of what method we use.\ To live in a more energy-efficient way, I would be willing to carpool more often and use hybrid (part electric, part gas) cars. I would be willing to use safe, efficient public transportation, if it were available to me.\ I would also use renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power and conserve energy at home by doing little things such as turning off the lights and television when I am done using them.\ Kate Dannals, Sparks\ President Bush's national energy policy is a political payback to U.S. energy producers. It prescribes production and consumption while conservation remains an individual's own virtue.\ But why drill in Alaska when an increase of just one mile per gallon in the average fuel economy of the fleet of American cars would more than offset the daily maximum crude pumped from the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge?\ We are locked in an addictive cycle of importing, drilling, burning, greenhouse gas emitting and drilling further.\ As the world's greatest economy, we produce the largest share of greenhouse gases. And we require 330 tons of oil to produce $1 million in GDP, while Europe does the same with 140 tons.\ But apparently, the White House's priorities are all too clear: Feed the addiction.\ A nation wants it cured.\ Michael P. Panopoulos, Timonium\ President Bush's energy policy appears to be a continuation of the oil and automobile industry influence that has shaped our country's since the early 1900s. This is criminal neglect in a country known for creativity and inventiveness.\ Industry interests and greed have too long shaped our country.\ Would it not be more prudent to think about the world of our children's children and begin to build a better country?\ Kenward Barry Karow, Baltimore\ Extremist hysteria blocks sound policy\ The way to reduce high energy prices is to produce more energy, not to consume less. Yes, conservation is a worthy goal, but what is wrong with energy use, per se?\ The extreme environmentalists look at our Western, high-energy lifestyle with revulsion and cry to us, ""Sinner, abstain."" They seem to think there is greater moral worth in living like the average Bangladeshi. It's funny, though, how they never adopt such an impoverished lifestyle for themselves.\ Finding and using energy is not a problem. The politics surrounding it is.\ A large, coal-fired power plant emits about 7 million tons of greenhouse gases per year. In consuming about 3 million tons of coal a year, it generates about 150,000 tons, or about 50,000 cubic yards, of heavy-metal-laden ash. That ash is landfilled, and heaven help us if all that lead, cadmium and arsenic gets in our water.\ A large nuclear fission power plant, in contrast, emits no greenhouse gases and generates about 30 cubic yards of waste a year, of which only a small fraction truly needs special handling. Either deep burial or surface entombment in concrete bunkers on some God- forsaken desert out west would shield people and wildlife from the waste's radioactivity until the radioactivity has dissipated or we find new uses for the waste.\ The environmentalists scream ""radiation,"" but we never see them shed tears over the miners who die mining coal or the people who die from respiratory ailments aggravated by coal or oil smoke. And the politicians fall for their histrionics every time, it seems.\ Our knowledge of the environmental effects of energy production is increasing all the time, as is our knowledge of how to remedy related environmental problems and help nature heal when damage does take place.\ It's time to put our trust in reason and science, not environmentalist shamanism.\ Amos Hale Adams, Pikesville\ `Transit choice' saves energy, time\ Far be it from me to count myself a friend of the Bushies, but I think there is something to be said for avoiding price caps, additional taxes and wrecking the economy to achieve the Kyoto Protocol.\ I propose instead legislation called ""Transit choice,"" which would specify that the same amount of money be spent on mass transit as on accomodating private vehicles.\ If this seems out of line, it's exactly what Gov. Parris N. Glendening proposed to the legislature this year (although he didn't get it).\ What could be more democratic than giving people a credible choice between driving everywhere for everything and letting someone else do the driving?\ Worldwatch Institute reports that 30 percent of all people are too young, old or poor to drive. How many more people would be willing to trade in that $6,000-a-year tin box that we spend too much time in anyway if viable transit systems were available?\ I believe Americans have everything to gain from simply making transportation expenditures equal - including better places to live, less gridlock less pollution, lower taxes and, best of all, the better use of one's time.\ Paul R. Schlitz Jr., Baltimore\ U.S. can produce energy it needs\ If we intend to continue to be a world leader, we cannot continue to rely on growing energy imports. Nor can we conserve our way through continued growth.\ We must develop our natural resources in an environmentally responsible way, while encouraging conservation and efficiency. We must not stifle economic growth because of unfounded claims of environmental destruction.\ We are a country that cares. We will not sacrifice the quality of water, air or life simply for more oil.\ Forget the Kyoto hype and the hysteria: The United States is the greatest friend to the world's environment. However, to remain that friend we must expand our indigenous energy production.\ Jeff Beale, Elkridge\ President Bush's energy policy stresses both increased production and conservation; it does not favor one over the other as The Sun stated.\ History has proven you cannot conserve your way out of a energy crisis. Just ask Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon.\ History has also shown that capping the price of gasoline will not solve the problem either, because price caps do not increase supply and only increase the demand because prices are lower.\ There is no single solution to this crisis, but a combination of solutions that will heal our energy woes. Mr. Bush is headed in the right direction.\ David Goldberg, Ellicott City\ I am, and have been for nearly 30 years, thoroughly disgusted that we learned nothing when the Arabs shut off the oil spigot in the early 1970s. I want the United States to become oil-independent.\ Therefore, I favor U.S. domestic oil drilling at any and all land and off-shore locations where oil can be found, including the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve.\ Harry E. Bennett Jr., Baltimore\ We absolutely can produce ourselves out of this dilemma. There is enough oil and gas in the ground to support this nation's needs for the next 100 years or so.\ Certainly, by that time, we will find viable alternative fuels that can be economically produced and are environmentally friendly.\ Any country that can put a man on the moon, build the Panama Canal, defeat yellow fever, cure polio, win two world wars and produce enough food to feed the world, can certainly drill a hole in the ground and extract oil or gas without spilling it.\ This hysteria over drilling for oil is a politically-generated myth, perpetrated by socialists in government and their pawns, the radical environmentalists, who want to turn technology back 200 years.\ Robert L. Di Stefano, Abingdon\ The president is right that we should both conserve and produce more energy. But conservation needs willingness to use technology available right now.\ We can, for instance, replace incandescent lights with fluorescent ones wherever that is feasible and use air conditioning only on the hottest days.\ But, even assuming more conservation, our growing nation and economy will average at least 1 percent more energy demand each year and our environment must be protected. This can work, through sound science and common sense.\ Replacing coal and gasoline with methane roughly halves the carbon dioxide released per unit of energy produced, but will require lots of gas wells somewhere.\ The environment need not be offended, as evidenced by the way fish do seem to love those Gulf of Mexico oil and gas rigs and by the super-clean Prudhoe Bay installation near a growing caribou herd.\ We can and must both conserve and produce more energy. Otherwise, prepare for worse than California-style economic reverses.\ Edwin M. Talbott, Towson\ I believe we should drill in the wilds of Alaska for much-needed fossil fuel, regardless of what people in organizations such as Greenpeace say.\ We have the technology to allow oil companies to start drilling without disturbing the environment. Let them begin now.\ Louis Eubank, Cub Hill\ The Sun's ""question of the month"" is factually incorrect and should be corrected.\ President Bush's new energy plan does not stress increased drilling for oil instead of conservation. It consists of three elements: increased supply, conservation and infrastructure improvements.\ Kirk Q. Adams, Bel Air\ We can and must produce our way out of our energy woes.\ We face potential damage to the environment, but guaranteed extreme damage to the economy if and when imported oil is cut off.\ We must use our vast resources of clean coal, uranium and oil to be more self-sufficient. We must work on the NIMBYs and those with irrational fear of nuclear power.\ Ernest Michaelson, Hanover\ Most citizens don't know, and therefore can't care about, the energy involved in, say, a refrigerator door being open for five minutes, or a half-hour hot shower or the sun pouring through windows into an air-conditioned house.\ The way to avoid future energy woes must begin with an infusion of energy topics in our schools.\ The goal could be graduates who, later in this century when our population has doubled, will understand that all those nuclear power plants, though imperfect, were necessary to maintain our way of life.\ Nelson L. Hyman, Randallstown\ While the energy crisis is partly the result of our high use of energy, there is no reason why we have to be subject to the oil cartel. The size of the United States alone suggests gas and oil is readily available if we want to find it.\ While people in the environmental protection movement mean well, they have far too much power and the national best interest should be paramount.\ In Alaska, for instance, a sparsely populated state, the search for oil not only makes sense but is necessary. And modern methods of exploration make it possible for underground tunnels to bring oil or gas to one small station from miles around it without disturbing ground-level soil.\ Russell M. Hackney, Baltimore\ The United States can and must produce our way out of our energy problems, without seriously endangering our environment.\ At present, we import nearly 70 percent of our petroleum, which decimates our currency and ultimately will be a major cause of inflation.\ We have the wherewithal to produce energy from waste-to-energy plants and to drill for methane gas in landfills throughout the country. Solar-operated generators, windmill-powered plants and more efficient water power can also produce electricity.\ Of course, the principal source of fuel in this country and the world is fossil fuels.\ And today our oil companies can drill off shore or on land in a very safe, economical and environmentally sound way.\ We can recover oil without creating a problem with modern drilling methods, but people who have never even seen an oil well raise such an objection one would think the world was coming to an end.\ The real answer to all of this is care, consideration and modern engineering - all of which this country has and should put to use.\ Laurence K. Harper, Stevenson"
234,"Sen. Tom Carper equated Senate passage of his transportation measure this week with ""magic.""\But in the end, the spell wore off.\House members voted 272-150 Thursday to reject the Senate version of the highway spending bill Carper successfully had amended earlier in the week. Facing a Friday deadline for keeping federal money for transportation projects flowing, the Senate approved the House version 81-13.\That means funding will be assured through May. Carper had wanted to shorten the bill's time frame to the end of December, figuring that would pressure lawmakers to develop a long-term transportation strategy during the lame-duck session, the most likely time for action.\Carper was the only Senate Democrat to vote against the legislation.\""This marks the 12th time in five years that Congress has resorted to short-term patches for transportation funding,"" Carper said in a Thursday statement. ""Our states, cities and businesses deserve more certainty to plan and execute the projects that will restore our aging transportation system and grow our economy. The millions of Americans we depend on to do this work deserve certainty about whether or not they have a job and families in this country deserve more convenient, affordable and safer commutes.""\Federal money for transportation projects comes from the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed mostly by the federal gas tax. The trust fund has been teetering close to insolvency, and federal transportation officials had said they would begin limiting transportation-related reimbursements to states on Aug. 1.\Carper has worked to find a long-term way to fund transportation projects included in a six-year authorization bill the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed in May. He chairs the committee's Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee and is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which is responsible for funding the authorization measure.\""We demonstrated this week that there is a coalition of the willing that is just as eager as I am to enact a long-term transportation bill before the end of this Congress,"" he said in his statement. ""That coalition includes Democrats and Republicans, business and labor leaders, truckers, motorists, transit riders and even cyclists. During the August recess and after we return to Washington in September, I will continue to work with this broad coalition to ensure Congress does what it is elected to do -- govern and lead by example.""\Carper's amendment also differed from the House bill in how the extension would be financed. The House bill lets companies defer pension payments, thereby increasing their corporate taxes when they report higher profits. Carper's proposal omitted such ""pension smoothing,"" which opponents rejected as a ""gimmick,"" and made other financing changes.\The Senate passed the measure, with Carper's amendment attached, 79-18 on Tuesday.\""This week, we saw magic happen in the Senate,"" Carper said in his statement. ""The institution functioned as our Founding Fathers intended -- we debated, we offered amendments, we worked across party lines.""\But House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had said the House wouldn't accept financing changes from the Senate, and his office seized on a technical drafting error in the measure that resulted in a significant funding gap in the Senate bill.\Carper and his amendment co-sponsor, Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said that the House could easily fix the error and that the House version blows ""an $11 billion hole in the federal budget.""\Rep. John Carney, D-Del., was among 45 Democratic House members who voted in favor of the Senate version, which he said omitted budgetary gimmicks and would force Congress to act on transportation issues.\""We've got to use the time between now and May to find a permanent solution -- we cannot let this extension distract our attention away from the issue of funding our nation's roads and bridges,"" Carney said in a statement.\Contact Nicole Gaudiano at ngaudiano@gannett.com.

238,"After 27 years of service to the community, the county's Chief Administrative Officer, Gerald T. Mason, announced he will retire at the end of June.\The county has appointed current Finance Officer Harold L. Higgins to step into Mason's shoes upon his departure.\""Citizens and government working together is the torch that Jerry passes on to me that I intend to carry and light our way as we continue to go forward."" Higgins said.\County Commissioner Judy Boggs said it's no coincidence both men started as finance officers, pointing to the financial strength of the county.\""We were very happy with Jerry Mason, and that was his position,"" she said. ""It keeps the whole team together and moving in the same direction.""\""I was president of the commissioners when we hired (Mason) to become the county administrator, because the previous one had passed away,"" said County Attorney Sonny Bloxom. ""Jerry has not disappointed us. He's done a fantastic job over the years.""\Snow Hill native Mason joined the county's staff as finance officer in 1986 and stepped into the role of Chief Administrative Officer in 1994, a position he has held since then.\Mason thinks his biggest achievement throughout the years is keeping Worcester County financially strong.\""(It would be) keeping the county's bond rating intact in a significant downturn in the economy,"" he said.\Major projects completed under Mason's watch include construction of the Worcester County Government Center, Animal Control, Recreation Center and Health Department, plus the Charles and Martha Fulton Senior Center.\Mason also was instrumental in constructing the branch libraries at Ocean Pines and Ocean City to serve an incoming older population.\""We've had the good fortune to have times of great feast, where the county had revenue coming in. There was growth with the population moving in, mostly retired, as it is today. These people came from urban areas ... They were used to, and, I believe, expected, county services like libraries and a health department,"" Mason said.\""Today, we have libraries in every town and every major community. Many other places in Maryland do not. And (the libraries) are heavily used. Ocean Pines is one of our heaviest used libraries.""\When Mason started with the county in 1986, times were very different. County government offices weren't computerized, he said, and they didn't even own a fax machine.\""A few years later, we computerized all our tax records and payroll and accounting. That was a major undertaking,"" Mason said. ""I remember our first computer. We thought we were the cat's meow, because it was the size of a massive desk. I nearly cried the day we rolled it out and it went to the dustbin. Now my cell phone has probably got more power than that first computer.""\Mason has seen other major changes in the county during his 27 years besides infrastructure, including the shift in power from the southern part of the county to the north.\""All our population growth went to the north end,"" he said. ""There was somewhat of a change in the power structure, going from dominating in the south end (of the county) back in the '60s and early '70s. That has all shifted because of the population influx that went to Ocean Pines and the Berlin area.""\Mason also saw firsthand the challenges of going from five county commissioners to seven.\""For those of us who were here when we had five -- before that it was three -- you see a different dynamic. Getting seven people to come to grips and agree is more difficult than five, I can tell you,"" Mason said.\""We've got a good set of commissioners who are broad minded, and, I think, leave their Democratic or Republican hat behind, and that's how it should be,"" he continued. ""I've had the good fortune to work for good commissioners over all these years.""\Mason serves on the legislative committee of MACO, the Maryland Association of Counties, and goes to Annapolis every Wednesday to sit on the tax committee.\""We review all the legislation that has to do with revenues and taxes,"" he said. ""The gas tax -- MACO wasn't in favor of that.\""When you're dealing with Annapolis, there are strategies you have to develop. Sometimes you don't object; you try to modify it, make it less painful.""\Today, Worcester County enjoys a reputation around the state as a smart, well-run county. In fact, Maryland's Department of the Environment modeled the controversial SB 236 septic bill after the county's strict development laws. But Mason doesn't take credit for that.\""I don't know if there's any rocket science to it. We just try to comply with what the law is,"" he said.\""Some folks think we sit on our hands and comply with everything that comes out of the state. That's not true. We fight it up to the final vote. But when it's voted and signed by the governor, it's the law of the land. We're law-abiding citizens. We're not going to create a revolt; that's not our job.""\Mason credits a talented county staff for much of his success as Chief Administrative Officer.\""I was nothing more than a coach of a team of all-stars. You had people like Harold Higgins and Ed Tudor and John Tustin. Those are the real stars. It was really a team effort, and I don't want anybody to think any different,"" he said.\While Mason said he will miss the people he's worked with, he and wife Mary Jane are looking forward to hitting the road once his retirement is final.\""We do have a few travel plans,"" he said. ""We drove across the county about seven years ago, and we're looking at doing it again. That's our main focus at the moment. I can see us eventually moving out West, because we have family in Seattle.\""I'm going to miss the people, for sure,"" Mason said. ""You become attached to them. This is going to sound corny, I know.""\ebean@dmg.gannett.com410-213-9442, ext. 14OnTwitter@ elainejbean\ID_Code: A7-304250001"
239,"How many more Newtowns must occur before we act?\How many more Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedies do we have to endure before taking action? \All of us are at risk, whether in a school building, a shopping mall, a church or any public place. We must put maximum pressure on the president and Congress to outlaw semiautomatic weapons and large ammunition clips holding dozens of rounds of bullets. \Also, background checks must be required on everyone purchasing guns regardless of the source, and the penalties for violators must be severe. \Automatic weapons with oversize magazines make large profits for the gun manufactures and their stockholders as well as gun dealers. However, no amount of profit is worth the lives of those victimized by such products. \It is not enough to empathize with the victims and cry at their funerals. It is time to take action to end gun violence in America. \David L. Pollitt, Catonsville \People, not guns, are to blame for school shooting \The headline grabbers want to say the Newtown, Conn., school shooting points up the need for gun control (""Congressional Democrats vow to push for stricter gun control laws,"" Dec. 17). Gun control is not the issue. \It's people control that is the problem. Parents and families have to recognize a problem in their midst and be brave enough to do something about it. If not, the next mass murder could be carried out by someone using a car, a butcher knife or a stock of dynamite. \F. Cordell, Lutherville \Right-to-work laws benefit workers \Having read your editorial on right-to-work laws, I was amused by your use of such comparisons as ""nations don't make taxes optional"" (""Right to earn less,"" Dec. 13). People should have the right to work without having to pay someone else for the privilege. \Years ago, a speaker at a seminar out West commented to a group of CEOs that ""if you have a union, you asked for it."" Which I believe is true. Profit-sharing and other opportunities should be available to all workers. If sales go up, everybody should benefit; if they go down, everyone should get less. \I had the opportunity to work in such an environment for a short time, and I enjoyed it. I didn't get fired but changed jobs on my own and received a check from that fund. \In all my working years I never needed anyone to ""protect"" me, and I certainly wouldn't be happy giving someone money to hold a convention party on my dime. \R. Ails, Joppa \A world without unions would be a terrible place \As a retired union member I'm appalled by America's complacency regarding ""right to work"" legislation (""Right-to-work measures pass in Michigan,"" Dec. 12). What is happening in Michigan could happen everywhere if folks don't wake up. \Belonging to a labor union means more than earning a decent wage. It means job protection, seniority rights, benefits assured by contract and protection from arbitrary termination. I held a job at the same company for 30 years and recognize this would not have been possible had I not been a dues-paying union member. \It would be wise for everyone, union or non-union, to study America's labor history. I doubt working conditions today would be so benign were it not for the labor movement struggles of a century ago. It's time we explored the past and discovered just how dreadful conditions used to be. \I don't think it would be pleasant to put in a six-day work week of 12-hour days. It would be miserable to earn a living in unhealthy and dangerous conditions. And it would be horrible to have your entire livelihood dependent on the whim of a boss. \Agreement organizations have made everyone's existence better. I would hate to live in a world without labor unions. \Rosalind Nester Ellis, Baltimore \How about a gas tax decrease? \It is not surprising that people such as Prince George's County Executive Rushern L. Baker III are calling again for an increase in the gas tax (""Calls for new road and transit funding,"" Dec. 13). Look around at all the other transportation projects that no one except the politicians wanted: the Intercounty Connector (billions of dollars), the Interstate 95 express toll lanes (billions more), the construction at I-95 and Route 24 (millions on top of that). It goes on and on. \The Sun brings up the fact that the gas tax hasn't been raised since 1992, seemingly indicating we need or there should be an increase. No, there should be a decrease. Interestingly, The Sun never mentioned all the fees raised under Gov.

240," Where is Maryland's higher-education lobby? The University of Maryland System has 130,000 students, 9,100 faculty members, 16,000 administrators and other employees, thousands of alumni and parents, and a prominent Board of Regents. These people live and vote in every legislative district in the state.\ Don't forget the many constituents of Morgan State University and St. Mary's College. Add the executives and employees from the hundreds of Maryland businesses which sell goods and services to the state's 13 campuses. What about all the technology companies which need something better than second-rate research universities and a third-world work force?\ Why haven't these groups arrayed themselves into a powerful statewide alliance to protect the interests of higher education in Maryland? Why have we hardly heard a peep from them while our public colleges and universities have taken a budgetary clubbing in the last 12 months?\ Look at what other groups do. When the governor suggested cutting 83 state-police positions, the law-enforcement lobby sprang into action. Headlines blared. Talk shows squawked. Armed state troopers poured into Annapolis and glared down at their legislators from the galleries above the House and Senate chambers. The 11,700 members of the state's Fraternal Order of Police ran newspaper ads opposing any reductions in state, county or city police departments. After listening to the uproar, the governor and the legislature talked it over and agreed to cut somewhere else.\ The state troopers know how to take care of themselves. Apparently, the people in higher education don't. In the last year the system has meekly submitted to five budget cuts, totaling $114 million, or 18 percent, which cumulatively have driven funding below the levels which existed before the ballyhooed 1988 reorganization. The system has cut 597 full-time positions and 766 part-time ones. It will now start to furlough its remaining employees and raise tuitions by 15 percent.\ Students haven't marched on Annapolis. Professors, administrators and employees haven't jammed galleries and hearing rooms. Businessmen from Maryland's knowledge-based industries haven't complained. Alumni haven't objected. The regents haven't said a word.\ Why not? Where are you? Wake up. Our chances of building a nationally renowned university system have just about disappeared.\ Are the regents a bunch of political eunuchs who won't stand up to the governor? Do professors all live in ivory towers? Do the students spend all their time at fraternity parties? Aren't there any political scientists in the system who know how to organize political pressure?\ Maybe a higher-education lobby needs a target around which to rally. OK. Here's something to mobilize the troops.\ Every year the state collects some $200 million in corporate income taxes. But unlike sales taxes and individual income taxes, the corporate tax revenues don't all go into the state's general fund -- the pool of state money which the budgetary process annually divides among health, education, public safety, environment and other programs.\ Instead, the state automatically diverts about 40 percent of its corporate income tax revenues into the Transportation Trust Fund, out of which comes the money for roads, the port, the airport and all other capital, operating and debt service expenses of the Department of Transportation. The gas tax and titling taxes pump over $700 million a year into the fund. But the diversion of corporate tax funds adds a lot -- $85 million in 1990 and $93 million in 1991. Next year, it might reach $100 million.\ Apologists struggle to articulate a rationale for this diversion. They lamely explain that business benefits from a good transportation system.\ Of course it does. So do farmers, workers, rich people, poor people and everyone else. Business also benefits from good schools, first-rate universities and a sound public-health system. But these programs must compete for their appropriations in the annual budget negotiations which divide up the money in the general fund. Transportation enjoys dedicated tax revenue streams.\ No economic, fiscal or rational policy justification exists for the diversion of corporate income tax revenues into the state's transportation system. In fact, no other state does it. Maryland should finance its transportation needs exclusively with dedicated user fees like the gas tax.\ The diversion began in the 1950s when the old Baltimore City Port Authority needed help. It's continued year after year -- not because it has a persuasive argument but because it's backed by a powerful constituency, the transportation lobby.\ Of course, the transportation trust fund now depends on the corporate-tax diversion. If the state stopped it, the fund would go bust. But a rational economic policy would raise gas taxes to fill the gap. Maybe a few economics professors could explain these matters to House Speaker R. Clayton Mitchell Jr., who has personally stopped all attempts to increase the gas tax.\ In the meantime, the political system fires professors, raises student tuition and also cuts back Head Start programs -- all in order to subsidize motorists.\ That's enough political ammunition to arm any self-respecting group willing to fight for its interests. The only question is whether the people who ought to care about higher education in Maryland will, finally, rise to the challenge.\ Tim Baker writes a column on issues of city and state."

Gas tax
\
Your editorial decrying the possibility of a relatively small 10-cent gas tax increase (The Capital, Jan. 7) was very shortsighted. When the price of gas can bounce 10 cents in a week, I do mean a small increase and I do mean shortsighted.
\
You talked about $1 or $2 a week per car to fortify our transportation system as if it were an untenable burden.
\
You rightly pointed out the cynical political position most politicians and anti-taxers take: Raising taxes for any reason is a no-no. But it's disappointing you would endorse the shortsightedness of this position.
\
Almost 10 years ago, our would-have-been president, Al Gore, pointed out that a 50-cent increase in the gas tax was needed to improve our mass transit and start shifting away from our addiction to oil.
\
It may have cost him the election, but he was right. We would have been better off if we started moving away from oil consumption 10 years ago.
\
When is the right time to do what must be done? In your editorial, you said not now. I say that providing alternatives to our cars as gas prices rise - and you know those prices will rise - is a bargain in any economic environment.
\
Will it be any easier when the economy attempts to rev up and gas again shoots toward $4 a gallon? What if the economy can't hum because gas continues to be $4 a gallon and we did not provide alternate paths to prosperity when it was a measly $1.50 a gallon?
\
Don't encourage your readership to be shortsighted.

Secretaries' pay
\
Regarding the story headlined ""Secretaries union files complaint over schools paycheck change"" (The Capital, Jan. 7):
\
Back in the '90s, I was on the committee that phased in a new payroll system for the brigade at the Naval Academy.
\
There are thousands of thoughts, questions and what-ifs that have to be cleared before a decision is made to accept or reject a system that will impact the most important part of the lives of a company's personnel - their paychecks.
\
Although many have to accept the Board of Education's reasons for changing how Unit IV school-based secretaries are paid, I strongly agree with the union and its argument regarding the board's need to comply with the negotiated agreement.
\
You cannot go back on a promise agreed upon in good faith by both parties merely by stating that one must comply with a federal regulation. The board has well-paid legal counsel that should have advised it against such a promise, if counsel knew the board would not be in compliance.
\
If there is noncompliance by the board, after 17 years an auditor somewhere would have or should have questioned this. Has that ever happened?
\
I guess that, when your pay is not directly impacted by decisions you make, it is easier to make decisions that impact others in a negative way.
\
Should this not change back to the negotiated agreement schedule, there will be a huge adjustment for many. It will take serious planning to bank the money while the well is full to be able to still provide when the well is low. The pay does not change, only how it is distributed.

E-ZPass
\
The proposal by the Maryland Transportation Authority, or MTA, to impose a $1.50 monthly service charge on E-ZPass users, and a $21 fee for new transponders, will actually reduce participation in a highly successful program that has been relieving both congestion and the pollution it creates.
\
Our household is one of what I'm sure are thousands of casual users of E-ZPass who use Maryland's toll bridges and roads on average about once a month. E-ZPass makes casual trips to the Eastern Shore or Harford County, for pleasure or shopping, more desirable, aiding Maryland's economy.
\
Adding a monthly service fee would mean paying an $18 yearly toll, whether we used a toll road or not. Time and gas savings aside, it then would make sense to pay cash.
\
This is ironic, since in today's electronic society the E-ZPass system should cost MTA far less per toll than collecting and processing a cash payment.
\
No one likes to pay for a service he doesn't use. This fee would cause many of us to return their E-ZPass transponders. Toll revenue and local economies would suffer because, not wanting to wait in line, we would not travel toll roads as much.
\
And when we did travel, our cars would join those already in the cash-pay line, adding to the congestion and pollution that E-ZPass is supposed to be reducing.
\
Charging a monthly fee for E-ZPass is like charging people to recycle. It will exacerbate the problems that E-ZPass was created to help solve.

Tolls
\
Your editorial headlined ""Recession's tolls"" (The Capital, Jan. 12) stated that trucks contribute up to 39 percent of wear-and-tear and maintenance expenses, so having them pay 30 percent of the tolls is reasonable. I agree.
\
Since we've established that, why do motorcycles have to pay the same tolls as cars? Motorcycles contribute less than half the wear-and-tear that cars do. They are less than half the weight, and their tires are much smaller than car tires. They get better fuel mileage.
\
Where's the equity?

242,"Gas tax hike would hurt Maryland's economy\Once again The Sun is out of touch with economic realities in proposing an increase in the state's gas tax (""Pump up the economy,"" Nov. 25). \First, a gas tax is highly regressive and disproportionately impacts the poor. Second, according to Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot, who (unlike The Sun) actually knows all the financial details of the state, we already have ample tax revenues in Maryland, which is one the highest-taxed states in the nation. \Third, the state needs to focus on creating an environment that encourages private-sector investment and the creation of jobs. Fourth, we know that higher taxes are coming from the federal level, and the state and city piggyback on many of these. \The Sun should analyze the states where private-sector jobs and private investment are growing. I am sure you will note that these are states with lower, not higher, tax rates. \M. Link, Baltimore \The GOP lost because it's out of touch \In a recent commentary, former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. exhorted Republican candidates not to whine about the allegedly liberal media (""How Republicans win in 2016,"" Nov. 25). \Of course, a few lines earlier, Mr. Ehrlich whined about just that, saying: ""Remember that the major media are not exactly even-handed when it comes to candidate foibles. Nine out of 10 journalists vote Democratic. Most possess a left-leaning agenda."" \Why are so many front-line journalists Democratic? \Perhaps it is it simply that when one spends one's life immersed in the real world, as working journalists do, one witnesses the travails and challenges facing a large portion of the American population, and that tends to lead one to adopt what Mr. Ehrlich refers to as a ""left-leaning agenda."" \People who live in close touch with the real world tend to have values similar to the Democrats. Mr. Ehrlich and his GOP cronies have long since lost touch with reality. \John Bonn, Towson \Palin for president? Very funny \I'd like to thank The Sun for the wonderful satire on Sarah Palin's presidential prospects (""For president in 2016: Guess who?"" Nov. 26). \Some readers may have mistakenly assumed that op-ed contributor Charlotte Allen was seriously suggesting that the stunningly unqualified Ms. Palin would make a plausible presidential candidate in 2016. But the author's sly tongue-in-cheek and wink of the eye were everywhere evident to discerning readers. \For example, the list of Ms. Palin's ""qualifications"" for the presidency included: (a) her excellent looks, so much better than the ugly Hillary Clinton; (b) the fact that she is ""tough as nails"" (apart, of course, from bowing out of the governorship of Alaska halfway through her term); and (c) she is charming and affable and doesn't back down (see item b). \Moreover, she is a woman and her son is a veteran; she has a no-name college degree, not some snooty Ivy League diploma; she loves men; and she survived both Tina Fey's mean caricature of her and Katie Couric's sneaky interview questions. \I'm sure everyone was bowled over by this absurd list of non-qualifications and appreciated the great laugh that this ridiculous article produced. But I would have thought The Sun would have stuck to more serious policy discussions on its op-ed page, rather than wasting so much space on what can't seriously have been anything other than silly satire. \Howard E. Bond, Cockeysville \Ron Paul set a courageous example \Rep. Ron Paul gave his farewell address on the House floor on Nov. 14 after serving 23 years in office over a 36-year span. During that time, he fought tirelessly and courageously for us, the people. He couldn't be bought by special interests, and his political pursuits weren't for self-promotion and didn't come from ego. \He was the leading promoter of liberty, peace and prosperity on Capitol Hill. His search for the plain truth of things motivated him to bravely stand in opposition to several of the traditional policies and practices that undermine our full potential as a nation. \Mr. Paul educated us on the importance of sound money and free markets and warned us of the repercussions of the Keynesian economics. He advised against the use of the monetary system as a vehicle to keep the Keynesian machine alive and which ultimately fuels deficits, debt and higher inflation, not to mention the loss of hope in the American Dream for many. \He vehemently lambasted his colleagues for supporting foreign wars of aggression with no declarations. \Mr. Paul may not have been elected to the White House, and his beliefs may not have been adopted by the majority, but trust me, we owe a great deal of gratitude to this man for his unwavering efforts. Thankfully, there were millions of motivated young people who were listening and absorbing his message of liberty. \Philip DeFelice, Baltimore\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
243,"Key to improving schools is quality teachers\As Erica Green reported in The Sun (""Tests to decide staff fate at 5 city schools,"" March 10), five city schools are slated for overhaul if their MSA scores do not improve. Under the punitive system set up by No Child Left Behind, many more schools are set to join them across the country.\Arne Duncan has said that No Child Left Behind has resulted in labeling more and more schools as failing, prompting him to advocate for changes in the law. But whether we change No Child Left Behind or not, the answer to improving schools is to improve the quality of teachers in them.\Teachers need not be young to be good or senior to be bad. There are great teachers across the system that are both young and seasoned. Young or old, we need more quality teachers in our poorest performing schools who will stay and make those schools stronger. Focusing on that project will go a longer way toward school improvement than any reform for our schools.\Jessica Shiller, Baltimore The writer is education director of Advocates for Children and Youth.\Industry: Hydraulic fracturing doesn't pollute ground water\In his column (""Hydraulic fracturing: a tale of corporate power and citizen powerlessness,"" March 8), a University of Maryland Baltimore County political science teacher restates a host of baseless and debunked claims from the anti-natural gas film ""Gasland."" Thomas Schaller - whose professional expertise is electoral politics, not petroleum engineering - should be aware that over the past 60 years, hydraulic fracturing has never impacted groundwater. Independent environmental regulators, top EPA officials, Environmental Defense Fund advisors, the Ground Water Protection Council and others have all confirmed this fact.\The UMBC teacher goes on to claim that the oil and natural gas industry ""rewrote"" the Safe Drinking Water Act in 2005, earning an exemption. The truth is that fracturing has never been regulated under the act - individual energy-producing states have always ably and aggressively regulated this critical technology. About that ""major assist from then-Vice President Dick Cheney"" in passing the bipartisan 2005 energy bill: As a student of American politics, Mr. Schaller and your readers should know that nearly three-quarters of the U.S. Senate - including then-Sen. Barack Obama - as well as 275 members of the U.S. House supported that legislation.\In the column, the writer quotes U.S. Rep. John Sarbanes: ""If hydrofracking is as promising and profitable as the industry claims, the industry should be ready to do it right."" Doing it right ? protecting the environment and groundwater, strengthening America's energy security, creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs ? are the industry's top commitments. That, too, Mr. Schaller, is a fact.\Lee Fuller, Washington The writer is executive director of the Energy in Depth Coalition, which represents natural gas and oil producers.\Bag tax won't stop littering\How entertaining it was to hear on the news recently that the environmentalist wackos who inhabit this state are at it again with a new proposal to charge retail customers 5 cents each for the use of plastic bags at stores. This is a nuisance tax proposal, plain and simple. Its passage would have little to no economic significance or benefit to anyone, save for the state of Maryland.\While it may be true that plastic bags from grocery stores and other retail outlets sometimes end up in waterways, taxing their use for common purchases will not solve this problem. The public simply needs to be made more aware of the necessity to recycle. The people who are tossing these bags around will not stop doing so because they have to pay for them. Apparently, the theory that operates in Annapolis is that any human behavior can be controlled by a tax or a fine. Nonsense!\This is just another example of intrusive, unintelligent government, whose purposes, points of view, and ethics are not aligned with the average citizen of this state. Every single time someone comes up with something like this, I just shake my head and wonder again where common sense went when it left the state of Maryland.\Frank O'Keefe, Perry Hall\If we've got slots, why do we need a gas tax hike?\I just heard on the news this morning that Maryland netted over $10 million in the month of January and $12 million in February from the opening of its two slots parlors. I know part of that money is for education, but why can't Gov. Martin O'Malley and those other big shots in Annapolis take some of that money to put into the Transportation Trust Fund that they raided to balance their budgets? Once you increase the gas tax another 10 cents, there's no going back. With the money from these two slots and the temporary one in Arundel Mills opening at the end of this year, there should be enough money to put into the transportation fund instead of raising the gas tax.\Kay Shultz\Alcohol tax: Do the math\""It's not 10 cents a drink"" screams the red bordered headline of a page-wide ad on the front page of Wednesday's sports section. The ad, placed by opponents of a proposed increase in alcohol taxes, illustrates its point by stating that the price of a 24 bottles of beer would increase $2.41.\Assuming that the math-challenged copywriter graduated from a Maryland school, he or she made a clear-cut case for increased education funding. And 10 cents a drink is fine by me.\Charles C. Yoder, Baltimore"

Environmental activists defeated a last-minute push by some state lawmakers to delay stormwater fees that will pay for Chesapeake Bay pollution projects.
\
On the last day of the General Assembly session, some legislators attempted to put off the new fees until 2015. The measure passed the state Senate but was not considered in the House of Delegates.
\
So, the stormwater fees -- dubbed a ""rain tax"" by some -- will be collected this summer, as scheduled.
\
""The two-year delay was a really bad idea, and I think it's good the House let it linger and go away,"" said Tommy Landers, director of the advocacy group Environment Maryland.
\
Lawmakers who opposed the delay argued Marylanders would eventually have to pay the money in order to cut down on pollution.
\
Sen. Richard Madaleno, D-Montgomery, quoted an old Fram oil filter commercial by saying stormwater is a case of ""pay me now, or pay me later.""
\
But others said the stormwater fee was just one fee too many, considering the state gas tax is going up and the economy is still sputtering.
\
""I believe in the bay ... but people can't do but so much at one time,"" said Sen. Delores Kelley, D-Baltimore.
\
The fees will take effect in July. Each county can set its own fee and decide how to spend it on projects such as restoring streams and turning stormwater holding ponds into wetlands.
\
Anne Arundel County's proposal is for residential homeowners to pay between $34 and $170, depending on their type of home. Businesses would pay based on the amount of impervious surfaces. The goal is to collect more than $26 million per year.
\
The County Council has tweaked the stormwater proposal, capping the amount that businesses would pay after some complained they'd pay tens of thousands of dollars. And payments by churches would be limited to a token $1. A final vote has not yet been taken.
\
Stormwater is one of the more vexing sources of pollution to the Chesapeake Bay, as it is both increasing and expensive to fix. When it rains, the water rushes along paved surfaces, picking up pollutants and dumping them into streams.
\
While environmentalists were relieved the challenge to the stormwater fees failed on the legislature's sine die day, they scored their biggest victory early in the 90-day General Assembly session: approval of a bill designed to boost the chances of a wind farm off the coast of Ocean City.
\
It was a top priority of Gov. Martin O'Malley, who planned to sign the bill on Tuesday.
\
The bill requires utility companies to sell electricity generated from offshore wind farms, and sets up a program for utility customers to pay more to subsidize wind farms after they're built.
\
Other environmental bills passed in Annapolis this year include measures creating a task force to study increasing pesticide reporting and requiring the Maryland Department of the Environment to issue annual reports on sewage spill fines.
\
Another legislation enacted will require the MDE to report on how money is spent from the Maryland Clean Water Fund and establish a small tax credit for recycling oyster shells.
\
Lawmakers also passed a bill on which environmental advocacy groups had sharply divergent opinions.
\
The measure from Sen. Thomas ""Mac"" Middleton, D-Charles, creates a voluntary program exempting participating farmers from new water pollution laws, in exchange for more oversight on how they are fighting water pollution.
\
A coalition of environmental groups opposing the law issued a statement calling it a ""free pass"" for farmers.
\
""The Maryland environmental community overwhelmingly agrees that this legislation is bad policy,"" the groups wrote. ""It contains multiple flaws and threatens the Chesapeake Bay and local waters, as well as the future of Maryland's efforts to manage pollution.""
\
The groups that fought the bill included most of the state's riverkeepers, the Sierra Club, Environment Maryland and others.
\
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, however, supported the bill on the grounds it encourages participating farmers to adopt bay-friendly practices sooner rather than later.
\
Alison Prost, the bay foundation's Maryland executive director, said in a statement that the farming bill is a ""win-win.""
\
Environment-related bills that died during the session include measures putting a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing for natural gas in Western Maryland, increasing penalties for sewage spills and enacting a 5-cent fee on paper and plastic bags.
\
Others that failed would have created a bottle deposit program for recycling bottles and cans, encouraged the governor to hire more Natural Resources Police officers and designated the soft-shell crab sandwich as the state sandwich.

246,"Marylanders are driving fewer miles and using less gasoline. They're buying fewer SUVs and more small cars. The vehicles they are buying are more fuel-efficient and easier on the environment.\Good news? In the long term, certainly, said Maryland Transportation Secretary John D. Porcari. But over the next few years, he said, the consumer reaction to high gas prices could bring severe cutbacks in the amount of money available for highway and mass transit projects.\""What's good for the country in the long term is very painful for transportation programs in the short term - at both the federal and state level,"" Porcari said yesterday.\Maryland transportation officials are crunching numbers from the state comptroller's office that indicate that gasoline and diesel tax revenues are down for each month of the April-June quarter from the previous year. The drop in revenue will likely force the postponement of road and transit projects that would otherwise have been included in the state's draft transportation spending plan, which is to be unveiled in September.\The fuel tax numbers reflect a cutback in the number of miles that drivers are logging on Maryland roads. According to the Federal Highway Administration, Maryland motorists drove 218 million fewer miles in May than in the same month last year. The 4.2 percent decrease exceeded a nationwide 3.7 percent drop that saw Americans driving 10 billion fewer miles than in May 2007. It was the steepest month-to-month drop in the 66 years that the federal agency has been keeping such records.\The negative correlation between gas prices and transportation funding has federal and state officials scrambling to find other ways to pay for road and transit projects.\U.S. Secretary of Transportation Mary E. Peters said this week that the federal government should look into congestion pricing - tolls that increase at peak travel times - and other means to support its programs. Maryland lawmakers approved plans during a special session in November to increase transportation funds and to diversify their sources somewhat. The Baltimore Regional Transportation Board recently decided to dedicate all of the added money that would bring to the city and its suburbs - an estimated $340 million over 20 years - to mass transit.\As it stands, though, gas taxes are the largest single source of funding for state and federal transportation projects.\Each time a Marylander pumps a gallon of gasoline, 18.4 cents goes to the federal government and 23.5 cents goes to the state for transportation projects. Because state transportation projects are largely funded by federal money raised through its tax, the national drop in miles driven represents a double whammy for the states.\The impact of expensive fuel goes further than the gas tax - one of the three main ways that the state collects transportation revenue from motorists.\Porcari noted that vehicle sales in the United States have fallen greatly. With every sale lost in Maryland, the state collects less in titling taxes and registration fees.\Porcari said tax revenue is also affected by the type of vehicles that consumers buy. Sales of light trucks and SUVs are way down, he said, while light and more fuel- efficient sedans are making up a greater percentage of purchases.\That affects titling taxes, which are based on a percentage of the purchase price, because small cars are generally less expensive than the behemoths that ruled the market when gas was cheap. Lighter vehicles also bring in less in registration fees.\Light passenger cars will use less fuel and reap fewer taxes than bigger vehicles for years to come.\""Titling, registration, gas tax, they all get impacted by the change in the types of vehicles that are selling,"" Porcari said. He said drivers' decreasing number of trips will also likely bring a drop in toll collections by the Maryland Transportation Authority, which saw a 3 percent drop in Bay Bridge crossings during the Memorial Day weekend.\Maryland's fuel-related revenue problems have been compounded by soaring costs for building materials, Porcari said. The cost of liquid asphalt, which, like gasoline, is heavily affected by the cost of crude oil, has risen 105 percent over the past six months and has quadrupled since 2004.\Lon Anderson, a spokesman for AAA Mid-Atlantic, said the state's revenue problems could be compounded if Congress does not find a way to replenish the federal transportation trust fund, which will fall below the amount required to keep up its payments to the states next year unless legislators and the president come up with another source of revenue.\""In 2009, it's going to be broke anyway, and that's before we had this contraction of miles driven,"" Anderson said. ""When the next president comes into office, the next president will not have long to contemplate this crisis.""\Porcari said Maryland's transportation system has felt less impact from the revenue fall-off than other states because Gov. Martin O'Malley successfully sought an increase in transportation revenue during the special session . The secretary said he has spoken to counterparts in other states and learned that ""most of them are in far worse shape.""\Sensing political resistance in the face of what were then perceived as sky-high gas prices, the O'Malley administration in 2007 did not seek an increase in the state gasoline tax, which has remained level since the early 1990s even as the price of fuel has more than tripled. The administration primarily relied instead on an increase in the titling tax, which is vulnerable to slowdowns in car sales, and a portion of its increase in the sales tax - less vulnerable to gas prices but still affected by sluggishness in the economy.\Anderson noted that the roughly $450 million a year the administration raised during the special session fell short of the $600 million a year the Transportation Department had said it needed. And he noted that a few months after it approved the new money, the General Assembly tapped the state Transportation Trust Fund for about $75 million to pay for the elimination of an unpopular computer services tax.\Porcari said it is too soon to identify specific projects that might have to be postponed or scaled back because of the decreased revenue. He said maintenance of existing systems and safety projects will take priority, while such projects as road widenings and the acquisition of new railcars might have to be deferred.\""There's no question that lower revenues will translate into fewer projects,"" Porcari said.\michael.dresser@baltsun.com\Credit: Sun reporter"
247," Back in June, the Senate reversed four decades of a no-choicehighway-building policy by passing a five-year, $123-billion Surface Transportation Act that seemed headed to new, higher ground.\ The bill stressed efficient transportation over mindless spending. It expanded mass transit, pedestrian, bicycle and congestion-management options. It said coherent land-use planning was important. It gave states and metropolitan areas new flexibility to control transportation spending in ways that make sense for their areas.\ It all seemed to be too good to be true. And it turns out it was.\ On the House side, powerful Public Works Committee members just couldn't be restrained from packing the nation's big new transportation bill, first of the post-Interstate era, with pork-barrel projects.\ They invited other House members to join the feeding frenzy. Then they weighed the bill down with a 5-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase, chiefly to pay for their pet projects.\ That prompted the Transportation Secretary, Samuel Skinner, to declare: ""We do not need to pluck another nickel from our pockets to pave America with pork."" A presidential veto was threatened, due to the new tax. Action was put off until Congress reassembles this month.\ But even before the committee-approved House bill has reached the floor, there's fear of stalemate and talk of Congress passing instead a one-year reauthorization of current federal transportation spending. New York's Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., chief architect of the more imaginative Senate measure, is dead set against that:\ ""There will be no short-term reauthorization. . . . With the Interstate system finished, there is no absolute need for a federal highway program.""\ The standoff could be resolved by the House agreeing to the measure the Senate passed, 91 to 7. But that means House members forsaking the 500-plus ""demonstration projects,"" to cost about $11 billion, which they stuffed into their bill.\ It features $287 million in projects for the Pennsylvania district of Rep. Bud Shuster, second-ranking Republican on the House Public Works Committee. The chairman, New Jersey Democrat Robert Roe, would get $225 million to finish a Passaic County highway, plus $14.2 million to elevate 14 bridges.\ The political payoff list rolls on and on -- and House members have already flooded their districts with press releases hailing their great ""bring-home-the-bacon"" triumphs.\ What's appalling is that in the interests of pork-barreling, the House not only would fleece the taxpayer with an added gas tax but would vitiate the Senate bill's new features of state and local decision-making, plus its special focus on urban areas and environmental issues.\ ""You get as much productivity out the Senate bill without a tax as you do out the House with a tax,"" notes David Burwell, president of the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy and a leading member of the activist Surface Transportation Policy Project.\ The House bill does make a bow to increased state-local planning and provides billions more for mass transit than Mr. Bush originally proposed. But its five-year cost is $30.5 billion more than the Senate measure and it ends up providing $6 billion less for flexible funding to let metropolitan areas decide their own transit priorities.\ The House version is skewed toward highways, dedicating $40 billion over five years for a big new national system. The Senate agreed to only $7.9 billion for the new national highway system, and only to avoid a veto by President Bush, who's for big new roads.\ What we're seeing is how incumbent-oriented congressional politics so easily make common cause with special interests like the highway lobby, and so easily eclipse individual state and city needs, and the environment.\ Some House members seem openly contemptuous of the idea that states should be given full discretion in deciding their own transportation priorities. ""It's baloney,"" says Representative Shuster, to believe that ""state governments have been anointed from on high,"" that only they ""have the ability and purity to identify the real needs.""\ Great, one can reply, but why should a single congressman like Mr. Shuster have the clout to bill national taxpayers for a quarter-billion dollars worth of road projects in his district? Who says that's where the most need exists?\ The American Road and Transportation Builders Association knew which side its bread was buttered on when it warned: ""If the Moynihan legislation could go through unchanged, half the ability of an individual member to influence approval of these kinds of projects would go out the window.""\ The struggle is a metaphor for the nation's increasing distrust of a Congress that's forever passing programs, failing to monitor them well, flunking the budget-balancing test and then trying to bribe the home folks with pork-barrel goodies.\ State and local officials are no angels either. But they do seem to lack the overweening pride that comes with semi-permanent congressional incumbency with its constant accumulation of new national debt.\ State and metropolitan officials are the ones we expect to make the fine-line, balancing judgments about which kinds of roads and transit facilities are most needed, which make the best use of scarce dollars and which are friendliest to the environment.\ It's high time congressmen got out of the way, to let the state and local folks do their job.\ Neal R. Peirce writes a column on state and urban affairs."

The Citizens Campaign for the Environment hosts its annual Legislative Summit later this month. Attendees will learn about environmentalists' top priorities for this year's General Assembly session. Several lawmakers usually attend the event.
\
The event usually is packed, so get there early to ensure a seat.
\
WHAT: Environmental Legislative Summit.
\
WHEN: 4:30 to 6 p.m. on Jan. 29.
\
WHERE: Miller Senate Office Building, 11 Bladen St. in Annapolis.
\
INFO: www.mdlcv.org.
\
While much of the focus for state lawmakers in Annapolis the next three months will be on hot-button issues -- gun control, the death penalty, the gas tax -- environmental issues also will be debated.
\
Environmental advocates had a banner year in 2012, winning victories on limiting new housing developments with septic systems and paying for fixing stormwater pollution.
\
They're hoping to get even more environmentally-friendly bills passed in 2013, including a high-profile bill on windpower.
\
""There's some cautious optimism that things we're looking to do this year for the environment hopefully will get some traction,"" said Erik Michelsen, who leads the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, a coalition of more than two dozen environmental advocacy groups.
\
Meanwhile, there could be push back from people who are not thrilled with new environmental laws, especially from rural counties where the cost is a concern.
\
""There are going to be many attacks on our programs,"" said Alison Prost, Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. ""It's becoming very real for people the changes they'll have to make for their every day lives.""
\
Here's a look at some of the key environmental issues for the 2013 General Assembly session.
\
Windpower
\
Gov. Martin O'Malley is expected to make a big push to promote windpower off of the coast of Ocean City.
\
The bill has stalled in past years, but a change in membership of a state Senate committee could bolster the bill's chances this year.
\
Sen. Anthony Muse of Prince George's County was moved out of the Senate Finance Committee, which votes on the bill. He's being replaced by Sen. Victor Ramirez, also from Prince George's County. Both are Democrats, but Muse has opposed the wind bill in the past.
\
Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. said windpower will be debated by the full Senate this year. It passed the House of Delegates last year.
\
The governor's wind bill likely will require that a certain percentage of electricity sold in Maryland will have to come from windpower.
\
""It creates a niche that would theoretically provide more incentive for firms"" to develop wind projects, said Michelsen, who is executive director of the South River Federation in Edgewater in addition to his duties with the Citizens Campaign for the Environment.
\
Fracking
\
Energy companies have been eyeing the Western Maryland mountains as a place to drill for natural gas using a controversial technique called hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking.""
\
Part of the Marcellus Shale, a gas-rich underground formation, runs through Western Maryland.
\
Environmentalists are concerned that if done improperly, fracking could contaminate groundwater with substances used in the drilling process.
\
O'Malley issued an executive order in 2011 that created a commission to evaluate fracking's potential effects in Maryland, so the industry has been on hold until the commission's work is complete.
\
Michelsen said it's important to put stronger moratorium in place, at least for now.
\
""This would be a more formal way to make sure it doesn't move forward until it's better understood,"" he said.
\
Del. Heather Mizeur, D-Montgomery, said she'll introduce a bill to put an official moratorium in place until adequate studies and risk analyses are done.
\
""We have more questions than answers that continue to trouble us in Maryland,"" Mizeur said during a press conference earlier this week.
\
Drew Cobbs, executive director of the Maryland Petroleum Council, said it's premature to take any action on fracking. He said it's best to wait until the governor's fracking group makes its recommendations in 2014.
\
""The process is ongoing,"" he said. ""Obviously, certain people just want the answer 'No' under any conditions. But it's premature to do anything until the commission finishes their work.""
\
Anti-fracking activists hit the ground running, holding a demonstration on the first day of the General Assembly session featuring murky-looking well water contaminated by fracking in Pennsylvania.
\
Chesapeake Bay
\
Advocates for the Chesapeake Bay aren't pushing many major bills; rather, they expect to play lots of defense this session.
\
""We are very cognizant of the wins we got last session. We want to defend them,"" said Prost from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
\
In 2012, state lawmakers required local governments to institute some form of a stormwater tax and also set out new guidelines for limiting the use of septic systems in new housing developments.
\
Both have proven unpopular, especially in rural counties, and could be undone through legislation.
\
Chesapeake Bay advocates also will work to protect funding sources for the bay, including the Chesapeake Bay 2010 Trust Fund, which pays for on-the-ground projects.
\
Del. Cathy Vitale, R-Severna Park, has a bill that would make sure that the Maryland Clean Water Fund -- which gets money from fines and permit fees -- would be used more for on-the-ground projects and less for administrative purposes. The Capital reported last year that the majority of the Maryland Clean Water Fund pays for salaries at the Maryland Department of the Environment.
\
Sen. Bryan Simonaire, R-Pasadena, plans to sponsor a bill to increase fines for sewage spills.
\
Bags and bottles
\
Two perennial trash-related issues will get yet another airing in Annapolis this year.
\
One measure would add a fee -- probably a few pennies -- onto each disposable bag distributed by stores. Some of the money would go to environmental programs and some would be kept by the retailers.
\
Another bill would put a deposit on plastic bottles, with the money returned to customers when they take the bottles in for recycling. Bottle deposits are in place in several other states.
\
The goal of both bills is to reduce the amount of trash and litter.
\
""Things like bags and bottles are representative of stormwater runoff,"" said Prost of the bay foundation. ""For every bottle or bag you see, there's sediment, phosphorus, oil that comes with it also.""
\
Pesticides
\
The Pesticide Information Act would require people who sell or apply pesticides to report certain information to the state.
\
The idea is to make sure the state has information on hand if it needs to investigate health, safety or environmental issues that might involve pesticides.

"
249," Recycling bins are back in the State House. The governor rides in a sport utility vehicle that can burn ethanol. Maryland is about to join a handful of states that mandate low-emission cars, and it is closer than it has been in years to prohibiting smoking in bars, abolishing the death penalty and banning assault weapons.\ In ways large and small, Annapolis is showing signs of a leftward tilt just six weeks after Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley succeeded Republican Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.\ But halfway into the General Assembly session, just how liberal Maryland's new government is remains to be settled. Bills that would raise cigarette taxes to expand health care, impose a fee on new development to clean up the Chesapeake Bay and give state unions greater bargaining power are hardly a sure thing, even with a Democrats in control of the legislature.\ Tax increases - likely to be a major topic in Annapolis as lawmakers grapple with expected revenue shortfalls of more than $1 billion a year - have been suggested, but O'Malley has talked about trying first to make state government more cost-efficient.\ Even though all of the leaders in Annapolis are Democrats, they often do not agree on how or when to tackle major issues, and some say the State House has an institutional conservatism.\ ""He's a progressive,"" Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, a Democrat, said of O'Malley. ""I don't mind being progressive. ... But we've got a lot of institutional memory here. It's a philosophy that we stand on the shoulders of the senators who came before us.""\ Maryland's constitution gives the governor tremendous power to set the direction of the state, but Assembly rules give the House speaker and Senate president significant authority over the course of legislation.\ When all three agree, the government can move rapidly. But former House Speaker Casper R. Taylor Jr., a Democrat who is now a lobbyist, said there is usually an institutional tension between the presiding officers that slows things down. That's happening now with the budget, he said, and it's a good thing.\ ""The governor is taking a very effective, comprehensive and deliberate approach to ... the most fundamental issue facing the Maryland state government right now, which is the structural deficit,"" Taylor said. ""That issue should have been addressed years ago, and I include myself in those who should have done something. ... This governor is approaching it the right way.""\ O'Malley has acknowledged that raising new revenues - whether through taxes, slot machine gambling or a combination - will likely be part of the solution. But O'Malley said he wants first to try to streamline government and cut spending. ""We've gotten pretty good at estimating revenues and spending but not at estimating potential savings,"" he said.\ But on other key issues, O'Malley has lent support to causes that Ehrlich, a former congressman, opposed. O'Malley is lobbying hard to repeal the death penalty, which Ehrlich supported. He supports a ban on assault-type weapons, which Ehrlich opposed.\ Ehrlich rejected allowing illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at Maryland colleges; O'Malley supports it. Ehrlich didn't want requirements that would force the state to build environmentally friendly buildings, but O'Malley does. O'Malley wants to mandate higher wages for state contractors, a labor-backed proposal that Ehrlich vetoed.\ On such issues, O'Malley is holding up a green light where Ehrlich signaled lawmakers to stop. But because of the partisan dynamics in Annapolis, Democratic leaders were often spurred by Ehrlich's resistance. Bills such as an increase in the minimum wage and a requirement that Wal-Mart pay more for employee health care got an added boost because they could be used against Ehrlich in the fall election.\ ""They could unite for a common enemy,"" said Del. Christopher B. Shank, the House minority whip from Western Maryland.\ With that partisan dynamic removed by O'Malley's victory, the historical checks and balances of the Annapolis power structure have been on full display so far in this legislative session.\ O'Malley is pushing for death penalty repeal, but Miller is a co- sponsor of a bill to overturn the de-facto moratorium on executions that the Court of Appeals imposed last year.\ House Speaker Michael E. Busch proposed doubling the cigarette tax to $2 a pack to pay for expanded health care. O'Malley and Miller oppose the measure.\ Miller wants to legalize slot machines and to enact a 12-cents-a- gallon increase in the gas tax to pay for transportation projects, an idea that would cost the average motorist about $60 a year. Busch opposes both proposals, and while O'Malley is receptive to a gas tax increase and supports a limited slots program, he wants to delay action until next year.\ The uncertain fiscal situation has meant that many of the changes that liberal groups have been waiting for years to see are still moving slowly, despite the turnover in Annapolis. Legislative leaders, particularly in the Senate, have said they won't consider bills with large ""fiscal notes,"" Annapolis jargon for proposals that would cost money. Issues such as public financing of election campaigns could stall as a result.\ ""A huge plus factor for progressive legislation is Governor O'Malley. He's clearly a friend of working families,"" said Sean Dobson, executive director of Progressive Maryland, which lobbies for causes such as campaign finance reform and pro-labor measures.\ ""The downside is this deficit and the fact that bills with large fiscal notes are getting heightened scrutiny,"" Dobson said. ""If not for the fiscal shortfall, we'd clearly be in a better place than in the past.""\ A bill that would give greater bargaining power to state employee unions is among the priorities of organized labor - among the most influential liberal special interests and a backer of O'Malley and Democrats. The measure would allow state worker unions to collect fees from nonmembers to cover the costs of negotiating contracts that benefit them.\ Even though it is not expected that the measure would cost the state money, it hasn't been scheduled for a hearing in the Senate despite O'Malley's backing.\ ""I hope that legislators understand that it's our form of democracy in the workplace,"" said Royce Treadaway, a Maryland Port Administration employee who testified during the House hearing on the bill. ""I left with a feeling that they understand what we're asking for ... but it's in their hands.""\ On the other hand, environmental legislation is faring well. A measure that sets tough emissions standards for new cars sold in Maryland flew through the Assembly this year and will get O'Malley's signature as soon as the two chambers reconcile differences between their versions.\ Other environmental priorities have leapt to the top of the agenda. A ""green fee"" on new development to pay for Chesapeake Bay cleanup, an idea that was not on many lawmakers' radar at the beginning of the session, got endorsements last month from Busch and O'Malley.\ And environmentalists are confident that other priorities, such as a stormwater management act and a restoration of Program Open Space funding, will succeed.\ Cindy Schwartz, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation voters, said the election of pro-environment candidates as governor, attorney general and comptroller gave the movement a major boost. But environmental initiatives in Maryland, she noted, have never been strictly liberal vs. conservative issues.\ ""It's really about people thinking about the heritage of the state and what they want to leave to their grandchildren,"" Schwartz said. ""Environmental issues really cut across a lot of lines.""\ For example, Ehrlich pushed successfully for the ""flush tax,"" which pays for upgrades to sewage treatment plants with the goal of reducing nitrogen levels in the bay, and eventually signed clean- air legislation. And it's been true so far this year. Many Republicans signed on to the clean-cars bill.\ ""If you look at my district, Anne Arundel County is the 19th- worst county in the nation for air pollution,"" said Sen. Bryan W. Simonaire, a newly elected Republican who voted in favor of the auto emissions bill. ""We have the Chesapeake Bay, the Magothy River and the Patapsco River. If we can reduce the pollution in the bay and the air, that's why I supported it.""\ Debates on some other key measures with a chance of passing are not breaking along strict liberal-conservative lines. The fate of death penalty repeal, for example, rests on Sen. Alex X. Mooney, a Frederick County Republican and one of the more conservative members of the General Assembly. His apparently is the swing vote on the deadlocked Judicial Proceedings Committee.\ A measure that would ban smoking in bars and restaurants owes its momentum not to the changing dynamics in Annapolis but to those in Baltimore. Smoking ban proposals have been floating around in the Assembly for more than a decade, but after Baltimore approved a ban, O'Malley said he'd sign a statewide bill.\ ""I can't tell you how many times when I asked people about the bill down here the question back was, `What's going on in Baltimore?'"" said Eric Gally, a lobbyist working on the ban for the American Cancer Society. ""We knew our best chance to pass it down here was to pass it there. Even so, it's still really tight.""\ Shank, the House minority whip, said he expects that with the renewed energy among left-leaning interest groups and a governor who is encouraging them, more liberal legislation is bound to win passage under O'Malley. It's like soccer, he said, the more shots on goal, the better chance of scoring.\ ""There are still moderate and conservative Democrats who are, hopefully, saving them from themselves,"" Shank said. ""We have, unfortunately, returned to the days of one-party rule. It will be up to them to provide that internal check.""\ andy.green@baltsun.com\ Credit: SUN REPORTER"
250,"It comes as no surprise that Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. are duking it out in this fall's election over their respective records as Maryland's chief executive. Evaluating who did a better job running the state is important. But so is a sense of where either man would lead us during another four (or, in Mr. Ehrlich's case, potentially eight) years in office. Mr. Ehrlich recently released ""Roadmap to 2020,"" a compendium of ideas he hopes to pursue. It is vague in many of the specifics and frequently fails to address circumstances that have changed since he left office. But it certainly beats Mr. O'Malley, who has released no such position papers and whose website says next to nothing about his agenda.\Here, then, are questions we'd like to hear the candidates answer and will be asking them as part of our process of deciding on an endorsement. We also welcome suggestions from readers for things we should include in the questionnaires we'll be sending to Mr. O'Malley and Mr. Ehrlich. To submit your ideas, go to baltimoresun.com/endorsements.\Spending\The state's fiscal projections suggest that unless something changes, spending will outpace tax collections by some $1.5 billion a year for the next several years. And that may not even be the state's worst fiscal problem; unfunded pension liabilities for current and future state government retirees amount to about $17.5 billion, and their unfunded health and other benefits total $15.3 billion.\* Do you support changes in pension benefits like those that have been adopted by some local governments in the last few years, such as requiring employees to work more years? Would you consider moving toward a 401(k)-style defined contribution plan, like those that are now common in the private sector? (Mr. Ehrlich has promised to introduce pension reform but hasn't said what it would entail.)\* Are there state programs that don't work and should be eliminated? Are there others that should be expanded? Which ones?\Taxes\This is one area in which Mr. Ehrlich has said exactly what he wants to do - reduce the sales tax from 6 percent back to the 5 percent it was during his term. But he hasn't said how he'd make up for the lost revenue. Unlike the Republican, Mr. O'Malley has said he can't promise that he won't raise any taxes if he's re-elected, which is an honest concession to the unpredictable financial climate. But they haven't addressed some bigger picture questions about Maryland's taxes:\* Does Maryland's sales tax properly reflect economic activity in the state? The levy applies to goods but not services, which make up an increasing share of the economy. Would you consider expanding the tax to cover services but reducing the rate?\* Does the corporate tax fairly distribute the burden of taxation among businesses? Do you favor or oppose ""combined reporting,"" a system proponents say helps prevent corporations from hiding profits in other states?\Jobs\Mr. O'Malley's economic stewardship during the recession has been a major focus of the race, with Mr. Ehrlich claiming he has failed to prevent job losses and the incumbent saying Maryland has actually fared relatively well compared to other states. But what they, and probably everyone, can agree on is that Maryland needs to generate more jobs.\* What is your vision for Maryland's economy? In what sectors do you believe we can be globally competitive, and what policies will you enact - regulatory changes, tax credits, education or training programs, infrastructure investments, etc. - to encourage their development?\Transportation\As tempting as it might be to pigeonhole the candidates - Mr. Ehrlich as pro-roads and Mr. O'Malley as pro-transit - the real question facing Marylanders is how either would pay for billions of dollars in needed transportation construction and maintenance projects. Mr. O'Malley wants light rail for Baltimore's proposed Red Line, and Mr. Ehrlich wants rapid bus service, but we don't have the money for either. The gas tax has become politically unpopular, and its effectiveness is somewhat diminished in a time of improving vehicle gas mileage anyway. Meanwhile, the state's transportation trust fund has been raided more often than a child's piggy bank to help balance the budget, a strategy both governors employed during economic downturns.\* How should the next generation of transportation projects be financed? Commissions and blue ribbon task forces can make a recommendation, but the buck eventually stops at the governor's desk. What strategy would you endorse?\Environment\There are any number of serious environmental issues facing the state in the years ahead, from climate change and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to regulating animal waste on farms, but the area of keenest interest to Marylanders remains the fate of the Chesapeake Bay. The next governor will face a much greater federal presence in the bay cleanup. Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. Environment Protection Agency has set firm pollution-reduction goals and warned states that there will be consequences if they are not met.\* What specific changes would you make to ensure Maryland meets federal pollution-reduction goals? What priority would you place on funding programs that protect and enhance the Chesapeake Bay and protect or preserve the environment?\Education\The state's successful application for federal Race to the Top funds commits Maryland to reforms such as basing teacher evaluations on student performance. The next governor will have to carry out those plans. Higher education funding is also likely to be a key issue in the next four years.\* What further legislation, if any, do you believe is necessary to provide Maryland schools with the flexibility they need to be internationally competitive in the 21st century? (Mr. Ehrlich has been more specific on this topic, offering suggestions to expand the number of Maryland charter schools.)\* What is the appropriate level of tuition growth for Maryland public universities? Should Maryland continue its support of private universities? What resources and direction will Maryland's community colleges need to train the state's work force?\The candidates may be tempted to conclude that recession-shocked voters don't want to hear about new ideas for government programs. But a recent poll conducted for the nonprofit Advocates for Children and Youth suggests otherwise.\The survey, conducted by Annapolis-based OpinionWorks, found that voters - in particular, those who are still deciding whether to vote for Mr. O'Malley or Mr. Ehrlich - were receptive to a series of low-cost policy proposals focused on helping at-risk families and children.\For example, the group asked whether the $30 million Maryland has saved this year by keeping more at-risk children in their homes rather than sending them to foster care should be used to reduce the state's deficit or spent on more support services for families. Undecided voters opted for spending the money by a 20-point margin.\Rather than making this election a choice between a candidate who says the state's ills have been fixed and one who says they could be if we turned back the clock four years, we need our candidates for governor to lay out a vision for the future. They both have five weeks to make it happen."

Gas tax: unpalatable but necessary
\
In concept, balancing the budget and reducing the deficit are not difficult. Expenses need to be decreased and revenues need to be increased in a combined amount that brings them into balance, even after new investments are added.
\
The difficulty is political; having a wildly diverse democracy, based on checks and balances and local self-interests, to accept the discipline of shared sacrifice is not an easy task.
\
Cutting defense, entitlements, health-care costs, government waste, agriculture subsidies, interest on the national debt and dozens of other areas won't, by themselves, produce the $600 billion needed.
\
When you add vitally important investment costs that create jobs, improve productivity and competitiveness and help generate real growth (such as education and retraining, infrastructure projects, indexing capital gains, investment tax credits, enterprise zones and incentives for saving and investment) it's clear that there must be tax increases or, euphemistically, revenue enhancements.
\
Any examination of the net amount derived from taxing foreign corporations, increasing the tax rate on millionaires and high-income families, sin taxes on alcohol and tobacco or other cosmetic steps reveals that they simply won't raise sufficient revenue to get us to the objective.
\
Each penny of additional tax on gasoline generates a billion dollars of revenue. A $1 tax increase $100 billion of additional income phased in over a five to eight year period would make U.S. energy costs comparable to other industrial nations.
\
It would also have the effect of dramatically increasing fuel efficiency, making energy alternatives viable, stimulate high-quality/high-speed mass transportation, save our environment and, in conjunction with expense cuts and other revenue sources, enable us to reduce the deficit.
\
Ross Perot's economic advisers were correct. The gas tax may be politically unpalatable but it is necessary, and it ultimately provides the greatest good to the greatest number both for this and for future generations. Roger C. Kostmayer Baltimore
\
Why Question 6 passed
\
In his Other Voices column ""Churches should stick to what they do best"" (Dec. 2), Tom Bisset stated that: ""The clear lesson for churches in Question 6 is that political activism is a failed strategy for achieving moral objectives in society. The numbers simply aren't there.""
\
Mr. Bisset errs when he talks as if the contest over Question 6 were between the religious and the secular. He doesn't realize that there is no monolithic ""church"" or ""religious"" position on abortion.
\
There is no consensus against abortion within religious groups (Christian, Jewish, Muslim, etc.) nor is there any consensus among them. The Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights and other pro-choice ""religious"" organizations fought for passage of Question 6.
\
The main reason Question 6 passed was that the majority doesn't want governmental interference in private medical and moral decisions.
\
No one has the legal or moral right to make procreative decisions for someone else unless that person has provided for that right to be exercised on their behalf under certain medical emergencies. In a pluralistic democracy, the most widely shared value is freedom of choice in all aspects of life.
\
Another reason for the overwhelming passage of Question 6 was that people were tired of hearing the lies and distortions from anti-choice groups, and they viewed passage of Question 6 as a way to reduce the barrage of unmitigated noise. Mr. Bisset's column was an example of the perennially self-delusionary and distorted views of the anti-choice groups.
\
Mr. Bisset also said that ""people living out the gospel in the real world are the church's only hope for effectively influencing America in the years to come.""
\
People should be living out good ethical role models, concerning themselves more about good deeds rather than creeds. The obnoxious, non-peaceful, vociferous, anti-choice protesters at family planning clinics certainly portrayed negative role models and this may also have influenced the voting on Question 6.

Goodbye, WITH
\
Regarding the sale of WITH-AM radio and its change to a childrens' format, the station brought joy and pleasant memories to many of us as one of the best easy-listening stations in the country.
\
The approaching death of the station as we now know it will leave a huge gap in Baltimore's music scene. We will have classical, rock-and-roll, country -- and children's.
\
Those of us over 60 want a program of ""nostalgic"" music. WITH filled that need so well and for so long. Goodbye, dear friend, we shall miss you. A. Christopher Baltimore
\
`Dumping ground' editorial unfairly dumped on company
\
The Dec. 16 Evening Sun editorial, ""North Arundel's dumping ground,"" is based on erroneous and incomplete information.
\
Maryland Waste Associates had intended to avoid public comment on this issue pending the orderly process of city departments review, the Planning Commission hearing and City Council hearings on Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke's legislation, introduced at the request of the Maryland Hospital Association. We cannot allow the editorial of Dec. 16 to go unanswered, however.
\
We are unaware of any suit against the city that went ""to the state's highest court,"" as you say. The only case involving MWA that went to the Maryland Court of Appeals did not involve the city, and we won.
\
MWA is accused of ""sneaking out-of-state waste to the plant."" This is absolutely and verifiably not true. Every ounce of waste brought to the plant was accompanied by a state-required manifest that listed both the quantity and origin of the waste. Further, the Baltimore City health department regularly sends one of its inspectors to the plant to inspect the waste manifest records and the operation of the plant.
\
In addition, the citizens who have complained about the plant have been invited a number of times, both verbally and in writing, to visit the plant on a regular basis and observe its operations. They have declined to do so.
\
The editorial also states that ""community activists who have reviewed state environmental records say they have found evidence that the amount of trash burned from the authorized area alone is about 30 tons greater than MWA claims.""
\
It can only be assumed that The Evening Sun did not examine the ""evidence"" presented by the community activists. If so, you would have found that the evidence was completely erroneous.
\
The Evening Sun is encouraged to examine both the records and the evidence; or to save time, The Evening Sun could check with both the Baltimore City auditor and the Maryland Department of the Environment.
\
Each have examined the records and confirmed that MWA's statements on waste flow are accurate.
\
Of course, a phone call to MWA, the object of your editorial, prior to publication would have been even more appropriate.
\
It may be of interest to note that the ""community activists"" who oppose our system are urging that Baltimore hospitals employ our competitors. Presumably, they realize that those firms would have to ship the waste to other states for processing and disposal. What would be the reaction of the ""community activists"" in those states?
\
The editorial recommends that MWA open its books for an ""independent appraisal of the plant's financial state and operations . . ."" The Sun will be happy to know that this has been done.
\
The city auditor not only examined the waste flow records as noted above; he also examined the financial records. In addition, MWA made available to the city. . . all its financial records for auditing.
\
In closing, we regret the necessity of entering into a public debate in this forum. When we and Baltimore City agreed to resolve the service area disputes by negotiation rather than further litigation, we expected an orderly legislative process of public hearing where all sides could be heard.
\
That process will occur soon; but in the meantime the opponents, aided by our competitors, have used The Sun as a conduit for a misinformation campaign.
\
We still prefer that the merits of the proposed service area ordinance be evaluated by a more thoughtful process than a public shouting match; but, if there is to be more media attention prior to the public hearings, let it at least be even-handed and based on all information available.

252,"
Last spring, the night before the final legislative session of his two terms ended, Gov. Martin O'Malley couldn't sleep.
\
Instead of continuing to fret about whether the legislature would pass his bill to raise the minimum wage, O'Malley wrote a 1,684-word letter to his staff about the victories and struggles of his years in office, outlining the six qualities he believed made a ""good leader.""
\
Among them, he wrote, ""Good leaders make themselves vulnerable - it is the only way they get difficult things done.""
\
O'Malley leaves public office Wednesday for the first time in more than 23 years, leaving behind a substantial record of accomplishments at the city and state levels. His tenure also makes him vulnerable to criticism that he moved the state to the left and raised more taxes than the electorate could tolerate.
\
Both Democrats and Republicans consider O'Malley extremely effective at pushing his policies through the legislature. Yet they describe the Democrat's legacy in sharply partisan terms. O'Malley has either been a charismatic, nationalleader who pulled Maryland through an economic recession or a tax-and-spend liberal who went too far.
\
""History will judge him as a governor who accomplished quite a bit, whether you like him or don't like him,"" said House Speaker Michael E. Busch, a fellow Democrat.
\
O'Malley ushered through landmark social policy bills legalizing same-sex marriage, granting discounted university tuition to some immigrants in the country illegally, repealing the death penalty and enacting strict new gun control laws.
\
Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller said O'Malley has been the most effective Maryland governor since the mid-1970s, but his success in pulling Maryland to the left came with a price - one that was reflected in the November election, when Republican Gov.-elect Larry Hogan defeated O'Malley's preferred successor.
\
""Because of his politics, a majority of the subdivisions of the state felt neglected,"" Miller, a Democrat, said.
\
O'Malley closed the troubled 19th-centery House of Corrections in Jessup in his first term, but a gang scandal erupted at the state-run Baltimore City Detention Center during his second. While the state's online health insurance marketplace enrolled record numbers of people in private plans and Medicaid this year, last year it had one of the worst rollouts in the nation.
\
He increaseed sales taxes, income taxes on high-income earners and created new taxes on services. He also raised the gas tax for the first time in more than two decades and increased the corporate tax rate.
\
""O'Malley's legacy is the strongest Republican Party since the 1920s,"" said Joe Cluster, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party. ""He was a strong campaigner, he won two elections, but in the end, his policies created an environment that will bring this state closer to being a two-party state.""
\
Even some Democrats agree that the Republican wave that took the governor's mansion and a record number of House of Delegate seats was sparked, in part, by O'Malley's push to raise taxes.

"
253,"
Most of you will find this column stupid. It's about the glory and necessity of taxes and government fees.
\
Furthermore, it hails the requisite that they go up and up, as they have in the long course of American history. I'll try to change your minds that what follows isn't stupid, that taxes and fees are the price of a good life.
\
Certainly there are limits to these pocket-book extractions. Truly onerous taxes and fees can narrow liberty and limit ambition. But, except for the neo-anarchists among us who hate government and taxes, that stultifying threshold is nowhere in sight, neither at the national nor at the state, county, or local levels.
\
All Americans, especially the wealthy, compared to citizens of other advanced industrial countries, are lightly taxed.
\
However, we can't expect the costs for police, fire, utilities, facilities, education, environment protection and transportation to stay static. Inflation, the rising costs of government employee wages, supplies, facilities, fuel and equipment all require an increase in revenue. For example, an ambulance that cost $27,000 in 1975 now costs roughly five times as much.
\
At the state level, the costs of road and bridge maintenance and public transit have steadily risen; so too must the gas tax, which in Maryland had not been raised since 1992. Buses and Metro -- all subsidized as are our roads -- get the less affluent and urban workers to their jobs, reduce car traffic, and transport hoards of people in cities quickly and safely.
\
The costs of cleaning up the bay go up, requiring increases in the bay restoration flush fee and the stormwater management fee.
\
County Executive Laura Neuman vetoed the state-mandated stormwater bill last week, but the County Council overrode her veto Wednesday by a 5-2 vote. Now there is legislation introduced to modify the measure. Nevertheless, fees will rise.
\
At the city level, the rise in water fees for users has risen substantially. Perhaps the Annapolis government should have acted to repair or replace the aging and failing water system years ago, but now it is sorely required. Providing water is a city government necessity.
\
Readers of my columns may find it a broken record when I write that government is necessary to nurture the community and provide the essentials for civilization.
\
Individuals on their own cannot provide water, sewer, safety, transportation, coinage, education, recreation or culture. These are community functions provided for and managed by government.
\
All one has to do is to reflect on societies where government has failed dismally, such as Syria, Mali and North Korea, not to mention the United States in the 1850s. No thanks for us to be in their league.
\
Paying taxes and fees is a patriotic way to help and serve your community. Hating all taxes is the same as hating your community and all who reside there. It says: I'm for me and to hell with everyone else.
\
OK, that is a bit of over-the-top hyperbole. I mean, really, who can be happy paying taxes and fees? That is asking too much, but at least we should understand that the necessity for civilization and life demands that we pay up.
\
This does not relieve us citizens of the duty to monitor and urge government to spend our money wisely and efficiently.
\
The buck stops at the various treasuries, but where it goes from there is still our business.

"
254," Smoke Stink\ In her Sept. 3 letter to The Sun, Shirley Ann Mullis writes to say she feels her rights were violated at the stadium because an usher asked her to stand behind the alcove to smoke her cigarettes.\ She feels that since her admission price was the same as non-smokers and the stadium is open air, she should not be the one to have to move. She also resented the fact that the woman she assumes complained did so without talking directly to her.\ It was ironic that just after I read this letter, a nine-year-old friend told me how every game his family attends at the stadium is ruined by a woman who also has a mini-season ticket and sits directly in front of them smoking. He says sometimes it makes him nauseous and burns his eyes, and his clothes stink afterward.\ It is a common incorrect assumption by many smokers that if they are outside, their smoke affects no one.\ Additionally, the price of admission gives them the right to sit and watch the game. It does not give them the right to do something that forces others to abandon their seats.\ Because cigarettes are addictive and the smoker deprived of nicotine becomes irritable, it is no small wonder that a non-smoker makes the prudent decision to let the usher do the enforcing rather than create a scene.\ In previous decades, rights of the non-smoker did not exist except in elevators.\ Now that our society is becoming enlightened about the myriad dangers of smoking, the numbers of non-smokers are growing and the medical field is daring to be more outspoken. The days of smokers subjecting everyone around them to the exhaust products of their habit are dwindling.\ Sorry, but it stinks, it's irritating to the nose and eyes, it fouls hair and clothing and it's carcinogenic to breathe.\ If you are so addicted to the substance that two hours without inhaling cigarette smoke is a real problem, the problem is not the lady sitting next to you.\ Georgia Corso\ Baltimore\ Creative Signs\ With reference to the recent editorial entitled, ""Making a Monkey of Sign Controls"" (Sept. 10), the sign industry as a whole agrees with your editorial.\ Almost as misunderstood as the regulations themselves are the intentions of the sign contractors and sign artists who benefit more from regulations that allow creative works of sign advertising balanced by a permit process that restricts unsafe, junk signs that clutter the environment and often present a visual hazard.\ A reputable sign company survives on the word-of-mouth reputation gained from producing quality work and not by proliferation of unsightly signs.\ Baltimore County is currently attempting the arduous task of updating its sign laws. In the process, the opinions of all concerned are being considered -- community associations, zoning and planning personnel, business people and sign contractors.\ The result could be some of the most progressive regulations in the country that include the welfare of everyone\ The office of Anne Arundel County Executive Bob Neall has indicated that it is receptive to new regulations considering the objections of the community as well as the needs of businesses.\ It will take time to sort through the specific needs of Anne Arundel County, as the issue is much more complicated than the survival of a mechanical gorilla. However, it is both possible and desirable.\ The sign contractors are very interested in regulation and enforcement as well as willing to participate in the creation process.\ It is my opinion that if the sign contractors were able to have a permit process with some creative control over the signage production, the result would be more visually pleasing, less cluttered and safe. . . .\ Now, how can we go about regulating those unsightly utility poles?\ William C. Pearce Jr.\ Glen Burnie\ The writer is president of the Maryland Sign Association.\ M. R. Decoys\ I have only one comment to make concerning those unmanned State Police cruisers found parked along I-95:\ M. Aren't Cops. M. R. Decoys.\ William F. Alcarese\ Baltimore\ Abortion Issue\ Your Sept. 13 editorial, ""Confusing the Abortion Issue,"" states that the coalition opposing the abortion law on Maryland's Nov. 3 ballot is trying to confuse voters. After much discussion, you sum up the meaning of the referendum in the last two paragraphs:\ ""What's at stake in the referendum is not the right to know about the development of a fetus or the risks of abortion and alternatives to it. What is at risk is the right to have access to a legal and medically safe abortion if a woman is not able to carry a pregnancy to term.\ ""Voters who do know the issues and who do not want the government to tell a woman she must bear a child should vote yes in November.""\ In my opinion, you confuse the issue when you speak of the right to have access to a legal and medically safe abortion if a woman is not able to carry a pregnancy to term.\ Being able is a matter for medical evaluation and action where necessary. I do not think there is any question about that. However, being able is a lot different than finding it embarrassing, inconvenient, financially difficult or any of the many other reasons given. Abortion is not contraception.\ The government never told a woman she must become pregnant. The restriction used to be on what she may legally do to the defenseless fetus after she is pregnant. I believe human life is still very valuable and should not intentionally be destroyed, from conception through old age.\ Hence the referendum should be: ""Should abortion for other than strictly medical reasons be legal?""\ We do not need parades, demonstrations, lock-outs, sit-ins or any other form of mass expression of opinion. Let's hope that every voter will give this matter very serious thought, and then vote his or her conscience in private.\ William H. Kelz\ Baltimore\ Housing for Cities\ As I read Kenneth Treister's ""Suburban Sprawl and the Collapse of the City"" (Opinion * Commentary, Sept. 16), three little words came to mind. New housing starts.\ Whey can't we, on a national and a federal policy level, focus our attention on cities? Why is there the ludicrous juxtaposition of long waiting lists for public housing while thousands of buildings remain abandoned?\ Next time you pass a block of solidly built brick rowhouses screaming for renewal, remember these three little words. New housing starts. They are the candy of the housing industry.\ This is the same housing industry that tells us that there is no more tangible sign of an economic recovery than a sharp rise in new housing starts. But, like that sugar high that follows a sweets binge, they are not good for us in the long run.\ If a healthy economy is measured at least partially by the number of houses renovated in our cities, than eventually the money we pour into new highways could go to things like education and city infrastructure.\ Need more money for urban renewal? How about a gas tax? As it stands, we subsidize roads with our taxes, so why not level the playing field and make train, bus and alternative transportation more attractive.\ I guess the ultimate question for the housing industry is: When is the focus going to be on restoring the existing stock?\ Twenty years from now, I would prefer to show my children the vibrant city in which I grew up than the new highway to the new mall to the new reality.\ Thomas Goldstein\ Baltimore\ Family First\ I appreciated the beautiful and thoughtful letter from Usha Nellore, of Bel Air, about the diversity of ""family values.""\ But to me ""family values"" have some fairly straight-forward meanings. Such as: Don't have children unless you're married and can support them. Don't get married until you're pretty sure you've chosen someone loving, honest and responsible.\ When you have children, give them a reasonable amount of your time and attention.\ Don't be too hard on them -- or too soft. Set a good example to them.\ When you find that you and your spouse are no longer ""in love"" the same way when you first met, just keep on loving anyway and don't go looking for a new romance.\ Put your family first, before job, hobby, friends or ambitions.\ Elizabeth A. Fixsen\ Savage"
255," WASHINGTON -- All hail to President Bush for how he has conducted the war against Osama bin Laden. Mr. Bush has emerged a far better commander in chief than anyone predicted. In the war on terrorism he has shown steely resolve, imagination, leadership and creativity. Thank you, Mr. Bush.\ And now, I wish Al Gore were president.\ Why? Quite simply because instead of showing resolve, imagination, leadership and creativity on the domestic front, Mr. Bush has done just the opposite. He has tried to use the tremendous upsurge in patriotism, bipartisanship and volunteerism triggered by the tragedy of Sept. 11 to drive a narrow, right-wing agenda from Sept. 10 into a Sept. 12 world. It's wrong. It won't work. It sells the country short, and it will ultimately sell the Bush presidency short.\ I have no problem with nation-building in Afghanistan, but what I'm really interested in is nation-building in America -- using the power of Sept. 11 to make our country stronger, safer and a better global citizen in the world of Sept. 12, beginning with how we use energy.\ But so far, all that's happening is that we've made the world safer for Saudi Arabia and OPEC to raise oil prices again. In case you missed it, on Dec. 28, the Saudi-led cartel cut production by 6.5 percent to boost oil prices, while the world is struggling to get out of a recession induced in part by the terrorism of bin Laden and 15 Saudi hijackers.\ Frankly, the thought that U.S. taxpayers, who have had to bail out the airline industry (which was devastated by Sept. 11 and by higher gas prices) and finance the $1 billion-a-month war against bin Laden, will now have to pay more for oil because the Middle East regimes we're protecting want to hike the price is an outrage.\ You'd think maybe the king of Saudi Arabia would say: ""America, we're as upset as you that Osama bin Laden and 15 Saudi youth were involved in the terrible attack on your shores. So we want to help America -- the engine of the global economy -- recover, as well as the developing world. As such, we're going keep oil prices extremely low for the next six months, then we'll slowly lift them back to the $24-$28 range. It will cost us, but that's our tax cut for the world.""\ Is that too much to ask? Well, it seems so -- which leads me back to Mr. Bush.\ The most obvious bold national project that Mr. Bush could launch now -- his version of the race to the moon -- would be a program for energy independence, based on developing renewable resources, domestic production and energy efficiency. Not only would every school kid in America be excited by such a project, but it also would be Mr. Bush's equivalent of Richard Nixon going to China -- the Texas oilman weaning America off of its dependence on Middle East oil. That would be a political coup!\ It would also be Mr. Bush's best response to foreigners who are enraged by America's refusal to join the Kyoto treaty to stop global warming. Mr. Bush could say that by weaning America away from oil gluttony he would be doing more for the environment than Kyoto ever would, which would greatly improve America's standing as a global good citizen.\ There are lots of ways Mr. Bush could go.\ ""Today, one out of every seven barrels of oil produced in the world is consumed on American highways,"" says the respected oil consultant Philip Verleger. ""We could cut that by a third in five years if Washington were to offer tax incentives for manufacturers to produce more efficient vehicles and for consumers to buy them. Such tax cuts could be paid for with a higher gas tax, gradually phased in. Then we could replace all those American flag bumper stickers with ones that read: `I cut my oil use by a third, how about you?'""\ I don't want to be dependent on Mideast oil anymore.\ Countries in that region haven't had a good century in 700 years - - and they're not going to soon. Oil is their curse, as well as ours. It's corrupted their rulers, enabled them to keep their women backward and out of the work force and prevented them from developing innovative economies that make things instead of just take things from the ground. They have a lot of homework to do before they will be stable allies.\ We will all benefit if they succeed, but for now we have to look after ourselves. So, Mr. Bush, ""Let's roll."" Ultimately, presidential greatness is measured by what you do at home.\ If this war on terrorism ends with nation-building only in Afghanistan and not in America, it will be no victory at all.\ Thomas L. Friedman is a columnist for The New York Times."

Democratosis
\
Fellow taxpayers, our governor is suffering from a terminal illness called Democratosis.
\
The symptoms include acute impulse to tax, tax / spend, spend, foaming at the mouth to raise gasoline taxes, providing sanctuary for illegal aliens, creating and supporting an entitlement state for people that are here illegally, and disdain for ""those tea party types.""
\
The Persian Gulf is going to erupt, gasoline prices will spike well over $6 / gallon, and now this guy wants to increase the tax burden on the very people that need a break during tough economic times to drive to work. ""Gasoline is now under $4 / gallon so we can afford an increase!""
\
This tax will loom large when gas prices are off the charts. This terminal disease is contagious within the legislature and the democratic machine will never pass up an opportunity to tell us what's best for us. They lose sight of why they are there; supposedly representing our interests, not there's.
\
Keep up the great work governor. One of these days the folks paying the freight are going to wake up and rise up to the reality that you are one of the most disingenuous elected officials this state has ever had. Your fuzzy math stats are going to drive decent people into the ground and force them retire out of state in a less tax restrictive environment, but you can't help it because Democratosis' worst symptom is lack of empathy.
\
Our governor doesn't care, folks, because he's not running for re-election so continue sticking it to us brother and do what you and the rest of your cronies do best - tax, tax and spend, spend our money. Wow, what a great state we live in!
\
How you sleep at night without a conscience is beyond my realm of comprehension.

O'Malley
\
John Pollack's letter ""Elected officials"" (Letters, Jan. 18) reminded me of my anger and frustration over Gov. O'Malley's political aspirations and solutions.
\
He is going all-out this year to make a splash nationally with his leadership of the Democratic Governor's Association, after being elected their president.
\
He plans to shove tax increases onto the citizens of Maryland in record numbers, in this year of austerity for most citizens. He's not looking for any ways to cut expenses or to lower the cost of governing Maryland; he is just beating his chest and proclaiming that we will pay more money and make more laws favoring the entrenched politicians. He's going after national recognition regardless of how his actions hurt an already sick economy.
\
This politician is relentless. We will be forced to do exactly as he plans, and we will be watching the cost of his leadership increase with every political speech he delivers. Watch for it.

Global warming
\
Thank you for publishing Demosthenes Kazanas (Letters, Jan. 14) clarification of Ty Collins (Letters, Jan. 7) original discussion of impact of global warming.
\
Collins is right that floating icebergs do not affect sea level when they melt (a floating ice cube in a glass, if allowed to melt, will demonstrate this.) Kazanas is right that land-based ice (and some Greenland / Antarctic ice is several miles thick) will raise sea levels as it melts or slides into the sea.
\
Kazanas is probably right that in the near future we will build sea walls around Manhattan. However, in the longer term this will not work. Jim Hansen (and other respected scientists) expect sea level to rise by 5 meters by 2100; and by 75 meters (225 feet) when all ice has melted.
\
Basically what is happening is that as we use coal, oil and natural gas we release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, that raises temperature, that leads permafrost to melt, and oceans to warm that leads to release of formerly frozen methane, that raises temperature, that leads to more evaporation of water into the atmosphere, that raises temperatures all by blocking the escape of infrared energy into the atmosphere.
\
It is nonsense to talk of ""limiting temperature rise to 2 degrees centigrade."" Warming will not stop there until we stop using fossil fuels, and maybe not then due to the methane releases we have initiated.
\
Thus, Gov. O'Malley's proposed 15-cent gas tax is to be welcomed. The pity is he did not propose a tax of $1.50 a gallon; and that he exempted electricity and natural gas.

Campaign
\
There is fear that elected federal lawmakers are being influenced by those who make large political campaign contributions. There is also concern that lawmakers must spend much of their time campaigning.
\
In so far as the Senate is concerned, the problem can be solved by repealing the 17th Amendment to the Constitution and returning to having the senators chosen by the state legislatures.
\
The senators would not have to campaign so they could not be as readily influenced by campaign contributions and they could spend more time evaluating and acting on laws. If the senators depended on the legislatures for their positions, the Senate would be more likely to oppose the usurpation by the federal government of those powers.
\
Those desiring to influence federal legislation would have to lobby the legislatures and would not have the economy and convenience of the present one-stop shopping in Washington. This might create jobs in state capitals.
\
To change the political character of the Senate it would be necessary to first change the political character of the state legislatures. This would increase the time now needed to change the Senate and decrease the effectiveness of using a ""crises"" to stampede the people into giving up their constitutional rights and power to the central government.
\
Those who prosper most when power is concentrated in a single organization are those most adept at creating and manipulating organizations. Prosperity is spread more evenly and people are freer when power is distributed among several independent entities.

"
257," FOR THE first time in 30 years, the Baltimore region has developed a visionary rapid transit plan. Three decades ago, we let the opportunity to build such a system slip away. If we miss the boat again this time, the implications for the long-term health of the region will be dire.\ Across the country and here, time wasted sitting in traffic, ""code red"" pollution days and transportation choices are increasingly part of what makes a region competitive in the global marketplace.\ Speak with someone who has moved here (or thought about moving here) from Boston, Philadelphia, Washington or Chicago - or, frankly, from most other great city regions - and one of the first things they will observe is that our transit system is disconnected, slow and difficult to use. Speak with people who ride transit in Baltimore every day and they will tell you the same thing.\ In the past two years, the Maryland Transit Administration has undergone an intensive planning process to develop an outline for a world-class transit system. The proposed system would attract a new group of riders and open enormous opportunities for the regional economy to thrive.\ It calls for six rail lines (rather than the two we have now) and 109 miles rather than the current 43. A report by the Baltimore Regional Partnership identifies enormous opportunities for economic development along the new lines - more than 114,000 new jobs and 34,000 new homes. This is economic activity that won't need to add thousands more cars to our clogged roads.\ Now is the time to move forward intelligently and aggressively. Unfortunately, at the state level, we seem to be doing neither.\ Moving forward intelligently means a deliberate, detailed planning process that respects comment from citizens and experts. On May 21, Transportation Secretary Robert L. Flanagan unilaterally announced that heavy rail would not be an option for the proposed Red Line (which roughly follows the heavily trafficked Route 40 corridor).\ This came on the same day that meetings were held to get public comment on what options the state should consider for the required environmental impact statement. There was no thorough evaluation, no cost-benefit analysis, no opportunity for comment. This sends the message that the state Transportation Department isn't interested in public comment or a deliberate process.\ Equally importantly, it sends a message at the federal level that the Baltimore region may not be serious about a first-rate transit system. Right now in Washington, that's a dangerous message to send. A new six-year federal transportation law is under development. Regions across the country are lobbying the Bush administration and their congressional representatives to position themselves to access federal matching funds for transit development. In this competitive environment, if you snooze, you lose.\ With this in mind, moving aggressively means two things.\ First, there must be essential planning in order to get money for the Baltimore system. At the moment, the state transportation budget for the next six years includes only $3 million; $15 million is required. Failure to plan will end up with the Baltimore region losing to other regions around the country, including Washington - which has already lined up planning money in the state budget for the proposed Purple Line.\ Second, moving aggressively means that Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., Mr. Flanagan and local leaders must work every contact they have in Washington to ensure that transit in the Baltimore region rail plan gets the support it deserves.\ Some day in the near future, as more voters across the nation sit in more traffic jams breathing bad air, there will be more federal resources for transit. When that happens, the Baltimore region must be ready, and that means acting now.\ Finally, even if transit in Baltimore were not a top priority for the Ehrlich administration, there is still ample reason to move aggressively. The administration has recognized that the gas tax and other revenues will need to be increased to pay for transportation projects, including the $1.5 billion Intercounty Connector in Montgomery County.\ Raising this money will require a coalition of lawmakers from around the state to acknowledge the fundamental transportation needs of Maryland, both road and transit. Baltimore area legislators are already asking: If the Baltimore region gets nothing for a first- rate transit system, why should they agree to a large increase in the gasoline tax to pay for massive road construction in the Washington area?\ Transit is essential to our future. Let's not look back three decades from now, when we are losing out to regions with superior transportation systems, and regret that we sleepwalked into mediocrity.\ Let's get it right this time.\ Michael Sarbanes is executive director of the Citizens Planning and Housing Association."

260," A feeble attempt to end school patronage\ From: Bill D. Burlison\ Crofton\ Recent news accounts of the bill of {District 32} Delegates Elizabeth Smith and John Gary Jr. to require the publication of names of recipients of education patronage is good for a smile. It would be helpful if they would explain how their bill would change the current law, which presumably requires that this information be accessible to the public.\ For those who have forgotten, ""education patronage"" is the popular term for the process by which state legislators buy votes for the next election by passing out scholarship money to constituents. Unlike state scholarship funds, there are no scholastic or need requirements. This anachronistic practice was once a political plum in all states. Since 1978, however, it has continued only in Maryland.\ On the positive side, the new proposal would indicate that the delegates may still be feeling some heat from the last election. However, their colleagues need not fear. The public continues oblivious to this boondoggle and Delegates Smith and Gary as well as the entire Anne Arundel Delegation and most of the rest of the General Assembly will continue to support the practice. Indeed, the funding will probably be increased. After all, what is seven million dollars to our state?\ Keep up the pressure against BWI noise\ From: James P. Edmiston\ Past President\ Elmhurst Improvement Association\ I would like to comment on a letter by Mr. John Kovarik recently printed in your column. His observation that the knowledge of the new BWI 15R departure procedure would not affect communities other than Elmhurst (most particularly his own Parke West) was certainly short-sighted.\ While he correctly recapped the sordid procedural approval process of the right-hand turn procedure, he was incorrect in the fact that the right-hand turn of departing BWI jets would only affect Elmhurst (as he and other local residents have discovered).\ As the past Elmhurst Improvement Association president, I have for several years tried to rally support from other communities to protest against the right-hand turn procedure. We organized several letter-writing campaigns to inform local, state and national representatives of our opposition to this change of departure routes.\ In July 1990, after being informed by Maryland Aviation Administration (MAA) officials that it was making the 15R procedure permanent, I organized a ""town meeting"" that was attended by several hundred people, including local home owners, politicians (remember, it was an election year) and representatives from 10 other affected communities, such as Parke West, the Provinces, Peach Orchard, Harmons Woods, etc. This and other meetings we held were widely reported in the press, to include The Anne Arundel County Sun, but no amount of public protest swayed the MAA from implementing the right-hand turn.\ The result of MAA actions now inflicts upward of 95 decibels of painful noise pollution over Elmhurst and surrounding communities. We need to keep the pressure on the MAA to somehow mitigate and eventually reduce/eliminate this intrusion on our lives.\ We must continue to pressure legislators such as Delegate Marsha G. Perry, who met with community representative last summer, and who promised to consider and introduce anti-noise legislation on our behalf (once the elections were over). We must also continue to attend and speak out at the public BWI Neighbors Committee and BWI Environment Committee meetings.\ These state-sanctioned committees seem, at this time, to be the only forum for us to make our views public. You can also support and contribute to the efforts of the Airport Coordinating Team (ACT), who have waged war (and lawsuits) with airport planning and the MAA. We must also realize that BWI, while a noise blight on our North County communities, represents a huge tax and revenue magnet for the rest of Maryland. With the slow-down in fees generated by the Port of Baltimore, guess what other cargo ""port"" is now being pushed in Maryland? BWI.\ With the current fiscal situation facing the state, do you think the legislators from outlying counties care about our noise problem when compared to the income coming in from BWI?\ We can only keep up the public pressure and hope the airlines phase out their noisy Stage II aircraft for fuel- and noise-efficient Stage III airplanes. There is no easy answer to our problem, and we must all get involved if we want to see a change.\ Congressional scam must be challenged\ From: Douglas Arnold\ Pasadena\ Last fall, we as a nation went through one of the most difficult processes known to modern democracy: the budget battle. As a result of the budget ""reduction"" plan, we have endured numerous tax increases (including a gas tax which has hit the average citizen and propelled the airline industry into further financial hardship), but the promise of the $42 billion in spending cuts left us feeling as if at least some ground was gained.\ Then I read a recent article by Fred Barnes in the Reader's Digest that made me aware of this re-election scam set up to benefit Congress. Consider the following findings by Mr. Barnes:\ * Congress claimed over $42 billion in savings. Reality: actual spending will increase by $111 billion, or a $480 increase for every citizen of this country.\ * Welfare spending was increased by $22.6 billion.\ * Congress claimed a $2 billion savings by dropping the Postal Service subsidy from the official budget. The subsidy was still paid, only off the budget. Real savings: $0. In fact, total obligations for off budget programs total over $6 trillion, or $67,000 for every household!\ This deception is intolerable! How can we sit back and sanction the actions of the U.S. Congress in its reckless handling of our federal budget? As a resident of the 4th congressional district, I assert that Rep. Tom McMillen has not worked to be an influence to stop this charade. We deserve better."

Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. ratepayers will get a $170 rebate, county video bingo machines will be banned, and legislation to fight global warming will have to wait for another year.
\
The clock ran out on the 2008 General Assembly session at midnight Monday, as the 90th and final day was marked with its annual harried pace and lawmakers' last-minute wheeling and dealing.
\
For a few hours, things were looking brighter for the three commercial bingo parlors in Anne Arundel County.
\
On the floor of the House of Delegates, a proposed ban on video bingo machines - including the legal ones at Bingo World in Brooklyn Park, Delta Daily Double Bingo in Laurel and Wayson's Bingo in Lothian - was amended by a 69-67 vote to exempt existing commercial bingo parlors.
\
The argument for the ban was the machines too closely resemble slot machines and would sap the state revenue expected to be generated if voters approve slots in a November referendum.
\
But county legislators took up the banner for local bingo operators, who said their industry is heavily regulated and contributes millions to state and local government.
\
""These businesses will lose half their employment (under the ban),"" said Del. Mary Ann Love, D-Glen Burnie. ""It is a sad day ... when we say to small businesses, 'We don't care you're doing it right.'""
\
Out of the 15 members of the Anne Arundel delegation, only House Speaker Michael E. Busch, D-Annapolis, voted against the amendment. Just minutes after the vote, Mr. Busch met in his office with the House majority leader, legislators from the House committee that dealt with the issue and the Democratic whip in charge of rounding up votes.
\
Speaking to reporters after that meeting, the speaker reiterated his opposition to the machines and said the amendment had been misconstrued as ""local courtesy"" - the tradition of rubberstamping laws which only affect a local jurisdiction and are supported by the majority of its legislators - when it actually left the door open for counties other than Anne Arundel.
\
""(Allowing the machines) is an open door to corruption in areas and you are right back to where you were in the 1960s,"" he said. ""I think the amendment was misrepresented. It represented all the bingo halls, it didn't just represent Anne Arundel County.""
\
Ultimately - more than six hours later - the amendment and other attempts to exempt Anne Arundel were killed, the bill passed without an exemption, and the three bingo halls will now have to eliminate their machines by July 1, 2009.
\
Energy
\
The House and Senate had some other heavy lifting Monday, especially with the settlement with Constellation Energy, the parent company of BGE, still hanging in the balance.
\
In order to end dueling lawsuits, a proposal put forth by Gov. Martin O'Malley will give each BGE ratepayer a $170 rebate and also forgive $1.5 billion worth of decommissioning costs. In return, the state will drop all investigations into the 1999 deregulation agreement that led to skyrocketing utility bills.
\
The agreement had been thrown into flux after an amendment from Sen. Jim Rosapepe, D-College Park, and Sen. E.J. Pipkin, R-Elkton, would have required any new power plants to come under state regulation again.
\
In the end, however, legislative leaders were able to put the settlement through in its original fashion.
\
Mr. Rosapepe said he changed his mind after being assured the state could still move forward with reregulating electricity.
\
""We have the opportunity today to put money back in the pockets of the ratepayers, and tomorrow the fight to end deregulation continues, because nothing in this legislation will stop it,"" he said.
\
Marathon, sprint
\
The session got off to a slow start this year, as many legislators were still reeling from last fall's roller-coaster special session. Despite attempts from Mr. O'Malley to move beyond financial issues and head into public safety and other priorities, the state's fiscal situation stayed dominant.
\
It was largely quiet on the social issues front, with one of the most virulent debates set on a now-passed bill requiring minors to get parental consent before tanning.
\
As predicted, initiatives to create and ban gay marriage failed and the death penalty will remain on the books for another year.
\
Speed cameras failed, but Mr. O'Malley's proposal to expand collections for the state DNA database raised the ire of the Legislative Black Caucus and was passed in a much more limited form. DNA samples will now be collected from people arrested for violent crimes and burglary, but the law will sunset in five years.
\
But the larger conversations of the General Assembly were taken over by a sinking economy, which spurred hundreds of millions of dollars in spending cuts.
\
The most sweeping decision of the legislature was to repeal the derided ""tech tax,"" a 6 percent levy on computer services that would have gone into effect on July 1.
\
After high-pitched public outcry, the General Assembly replaced it with a higher income tax on people who make more than $1 million a year in gross income, cuts in transportation, and cuts to be determined by Mr. O'Malley.
\
Local money
\
Locally, few issues were mired in controversy outside of the efforts to save the video bingo machines.
\
County Executive John R. Leopold's agenda was praised by Anne Arundel Democrats and Republicans alike as being ""modest.""
\
Although there was some heartburn over lifting the caps on fees for wells and food licensing, legislators came around to Mr. Leopold's argument that the cost of doing business wasn't being covered.
\
The county estimates it is losing more than $500,000 with the well and food-licensing caps, and will now be able to get that money back. The Maryland Department of the Environment also will be required to pay the county back for about $100,000 of environmental testing it did during the fly-ash contamination of Gambrills wells.
\
Mr. Leopold said it was a ""decidedly successful"" legislative session for the county. He praised the Base Realignment and Closure legislation passed by the General Assembly as a good way for the county to negotiate payments from developers for infrastructure and to finish the Odenton Town Center project.
\
Overall, Mr. Busch said, the General Assembly has many accomplishment to be proud of from the fall's special session and this year's regular session: an in-state tuition freeze for the third year in a row; a new formula to give more education money to the jurisdictions where it costs the most; an expansion of health insurance to 100,000 more people; and $350 million more for transportation.
\
In addition, he said, the legislature did not raise the gas tax or pass on burdens to state employees or local governments.
\
Other politicians weren't so sure.
\
Del. Nic Kipke, R-Pasadena, headed out the chamber worried that many of the state's policies, such as energy and health care, will simply drive up the cost of living for residents.
\
""I'd like to be an optimist,"" he said, ""but I just don't feel we are going in the right direction.""

\
WHAT BILLS DID, DIDN'T MAKE IT
\
A list of some legislation considered by the General Assembly this session.
\
Passed
\
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
\
Constellation Energy settlement: Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. ratepayers will each get a $170 rebate under an agreement to end dueling lawsuits. The settlement will also forgive $1.5 billion decommissioning costs and end all investigations into the 1999 deregulation deal that led to skyrocketing electricity rates.
\
Energy efficiency: Bills passed that set a goal to reduce statewide energy use 15 percent by 2015 and to increase the amount of renewable energy sold in Maryland.
\
Critical areas: There will be some new restrictions on building along the Chesapeake Bay shoreline, including a 200-foot buffer in some rural areas. An effort to put more state oversight on local governments' Critical Area approvals was mostly watered down to win more votes.
\
Septic systems: The state will be able to use some of the ""flush fee"" money for grants and loans to help communities with failing septic systems in the critical area, including parts of Anne Arundel County.
\
Living shorelines: These natural shorelines will now be required when property owners want to repair or replace their shoreline protection - unless they prove they need something more substantial.
\
Chesapeake Bay 2010 Trust Fund: The governor's BayStat program and a committee will issue competitive grants from this newly created fund. The fund was cut from a proposed $50 million to $25 million this year.
\
PUBLIC SAFETY
\
DNA database: DNA samples will be taken from people who are arrested for violent crime and burglary. The law will sunset in five years.
\
Department of General Services police: The jurisdiction of DGS police will be expanded to 1,000 feet from each state building and parking lot in Annapolis. Part of the federal, state and local crime fighting initiative in the city, the police will cover most of downtown, including the Clay Street and Bloomsbury Square area.
\
Death penalty: After a bill to repeal the death penalty failed, the legislature created a commission to review the punishment and whether it should be abolished.
\
SOCIAL ISSUES
\
Domestic partners: Although bills to legalize gay marriage were defeated, people who fall under the criteria of a domestic partnership will get to make medical and burial decisions for each other. Domestic partners will also get the same tax benefits as married people when transferring property.
\
Tanning: Minors under the age of 18 will have to get parental consent before getting an artificial tan.
\
FISCAL ISSUES
\
Wells: The cap on well-permit fees will be lifted for Anne Arundel County so it better reflects the costs of inspections and other activities. The price will be 50 percent less for people who have an existing well but need to dig another.
\
Food licenses: Similar to well permits, the cap on food licensing fees in Anne Arundel County will be lifted to totally cover expenses.
\
Impact fees: Certain non-profits in Anne Arundel County will be exempted from impact fees.
\
Testing reimbursement: The Maryland Department of the Environment will have to pay the county $100,000 for testing it did during the fly ash contamination of Gambrills wells. The money will come from a $1 million fine MDE collected from Constellation Energy and BBSS.
\
Computer services tax: The 6 percent sales tax levy on computer services that was supposed to take effect on July has been repealed. A higher income tax will be placed on residents who earn more than $1 million a year in taxable income.
\
Video bingo machines: The machines will be banned as the state heads toward a slots referendum in November. Anne Arundel County's three bingo halls will have to eliminate their machines by July 1, 2009.
\
Base Realignment and Closure: Local governments can apply for the creation of ""BRAC Revitalization and Incentive Zones"" to encourage development around public transit. The state would refund portions of property taxes so the local governments could use the money for infrastructure improvements. Also, local governments will have the authority to negotiate payments in lieu of taxes for private developers who build on military-owned land.
\
OTHER
\
Animal euthanasia: Lawmakers passed a bill restoring animal control shelters' access to hefty sedatives used in the euthanasia process. The federal government recently yanked animal control organizations' access to ketamine and other narcotics because of holes in Maryland's regulatory laws.
\
Failed
\
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
\
Global Warming: A bill to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020 and by 90 percent by 2050 was killed.
\
Fly ash tax: A tax on coal fly ash to pay for more inspectors also failed. Fly ash used to fill a sand and gravel pit in Gambrills contaminated residential wells.
\
PUBLIC SAFETY
\
Talking while driving: A bill to ban talking on a cell phone while driving failed.
\
Speed cameras: A bill to allow local governments to set up speed cameras in work zones and school zones failed.

262,"SEE RELATED STORY (Townsend: Thanks to attacks linking her to Glendening, the supposed heir apparent finds herself in a rugged race.)\ A year ago, says Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., people told him he was crazy. Nuts, they said, to give up a safe congressional seat and take on a Kennedy in one of America's most Democrat-dominated states. Delusional to think he could compete with a candidate who already had collected millions in campaign donations.\ ""Nobody says that to me today,"" Ehrlich said recently.\ Why would they? For months, despite a less than sparkling debate performance and outcry over his anti-gun control record as a deadly sniper roamed the Washington suburbs, Ehrlich has been tied in the polls with Kathleen Kennedy Townsend. And he's raised $8.6 million.\ The explanation for this is a complex political cocktail involving early dissatisfaction with Townsend's campaign and with her boss of eight years, Gov. Parris N. Glendening, whose legacy includes a $1.7 billion budget shortfall. But the poll numbers also reflect that Ehrlich's campaign message has caught on to some extent.\ ""It's time for a change"" has been the theme of his speeches and advertisements. In a state where Democrats have held the governor's office for more than 34 years, the slogan is instantly understood.\ More than almost any other aspect of his platform, Ehrlich has emphasized the change he says he would bring to Annapolis, using phrases such as ""culture of corruption"" and ""arrogance of power"" to describe the sitting administration and some legislators.\ ""For 16 years I've been known as an ethical legislator. My reputation in that regard is spotless,"" he said.\ To back up his corruption rhetoric, Ehrlich points to calls Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller and other Democratic lawmakers placed to Maryland's top judges weighing a redistricting lawsuit. He also talks of Glendening angling for the $375,000-a- year job as chancellor of the University of Maryland, to be selected by the Board of Regents he appointed.\ ""I think that's played up for Bobby very, very well,"" said Senate Minority Leader J. Lowell Stoltzfus of Somerset. ""One of the things that people are getting is that he brings a clean slate. People privately - even Democrats - are very frustrated with Glendening, and some of that has rubbed off on Kathleen. They just don't like him. And you win or lose on whether people like you, frankly.""\ Even his critics concede that people generally do like Ehrlich, whose easy, jocular style helped deliver his message. His hometown- boy story of blue-to-white-collar ascendancy helps as well.\ ""I think it means a great deal to people in Harford County,"" said Del. Charles R. Boutin, former mayor of Aberdeen. ""He's got good, basic family core values.""\ Ehrlich was born in Baltimore County's working-class neighborhood of Arbutus, the only son of a car salesman and a secretary. His grit on the football field led to a scholarship at the Gilman School. From there he went to Princeton University, and then to law school.\ ""He's a likable guy. He's running on imagery rather than issues and his one big theme is change,"" said Paul S. Herrnson, director of the Center for American Politics and Citizenship at the University of Maryland. ""He's very conservative, particularly for Maryland. But he's conservative without the vitriol of Tom DeLay and Newt Gingrich, so it's very easy to make the assumption that because he's nice, he's moderate.""\ Townsend has built her campaign partly on Ehrlich's record, relentlessly reminding the public that he voted to eliminate the Department of Education, to lift the federal ban on assault weapons, to reduce spending increases sought by Democrats in the areas of Medicare, Head Start and other programs that benefit the poor and frail.\ With a few exceptions, Ehrlich's eight-year congressional record has been conservative, in almost perfect synch with Republican priorities.\ Legislation has not been the hallmark of his congressional career. Ehrlich himself says he is most proud of his advocacy for the blind, which has not gained much notice. But his party loyalty allowed him to rise within the GOP leadership, become close friends with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, and gain membership to a high- powered congressional committee and to an elite corps of House whips.\ His position in Congress, he says, will prove useful if he's governor as he tries to secure more federal money for Maryland for programs such as Medicare. ""I've been joking about how I'm not giving up my office on Capitol Hill,"" he said. ""I've already talked to the speaker about it.""\ Since announcing his run for governor, Ehrlich has spoken rather infrequently about his congressional record, instead pushing a moderate platform tailored to appeal not only to his core constituents - Republicans and conservative Democrats - but to African-Americans and other groups traditionally hostile to the GOP.\ Ehrlich has made no secret that he needs black voters to win. He chose an African-American running mate, Michael S. Steele, and made sure other African-Americans figured prominently in his campaign. In Prince George's County he has talked to affluent black voters about how he'll help their businesses. In Baltimore he has made promises regarding drug treatment, historically black colleges, lead-paint poisoning and the criminal justice system.\ Ehrlich believes he has, through luck and strategy, hit on topics that resonate with voters. ""The issues environment in the state has generally favored me, and that's fairly unusual for a Republican,"" he said. ""I'm talking about budget, crime, slots.""\ Especially the budget. ""No doubt about it,"" Ehrlich said, of all the state's problems, the $1.7 billion shortfall has probably helped his candidacy the most. Some polls show it has eclipsed education as voters' top worry.\ ""I've talked to nurses, psychiatrists, housing advocates, mental health advocates - dozens, hundreds of constituencies. They may not be all-important in terms of numbers. But when you add all of those constituencies together, you realize the budget directly impacts a lot of people in this state,"" he said. ""The more-sophisticated groups understand fully that the governor sets priorities through his or her budget.""\ In addition, Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike have wrung their hands over the money problem, neutralizing any partisan sting the issue might have and making it especially fair game.\ Ehrlich, who has been endorsed by several business groups, says he is better prepared than Townsend to fix the budget; a poll conducted for The Sun last month found most voters agree - even though his budget proposal is merely a ""framework"" that does not entirely add up. Ehrlich's main money-raising vehicle would be slot machines, which he would like to install at racetracks. He estimates slots could initially raise $380 million for the state in 2004, and between $500 million and $800 million once it's running at full throttle.\ While he has promised not to raise income taxes or sales taxes, he has not ruled out a gas tax increase or a regional taxing authority to pay for transportation.\ He would save money through 1 percent across-the-board cuts to state agencies in his first six months in office, and 4 percent cuts for the fiscal year beginning July 1. He would offer early- retirement incentives to state employees, and not replace workers who leave.\ Ehrlich credits his crime platform with winning him the endorsement of law enforcement groups across the state.\ He has been laying Maryland's high rates of violent crime at Townsend's feet. A federal investigation into the Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention, which Townsend oversees, has helped make his case. And Ehrlich issued a 40-page indictment of her leadership of the Department of Juvenile Justice, which was forced to close its ""boot camps"" after The Sun revealed that youths were being beaten in them.\ Ehrlich says he would revamp the juvenile justice system, handing the schooling component to the State Department of Education and beefing up drug treatment and mental health services for youths. He would also seek to keep fewer young lawbreakers out of the adult criminal justice system.\ Among his first initiatives would be to push for adoption of Project Exile in Maryland. Under that system, people convicted of certain gun crimes are generally given longer sentences in federal prison.\ The topic of guns has been a sticky one for Ehrlich, who has consistently opposed gun control legislation. He faced a torrent of criticism from Townsend and anti-gun groups after he said he would ""review"" certain of Maryland's gun laws to make sure they're effective, including ballistic fingerprinting for handguns.\ When people in Montgomery County began getting killed by the serial sniper Oct. 2, voters there - arguably the county most vital to winning the governor's race - began questioning his gun record anew. And Townsend began running anti-Ehrlich television ads showing images of assault rifles.\ Ehrlich says the ads probably dampened his campaign in Montgomery, one reason he has redoubled his efforts in next-door Prince George's County.\ While Ehrlich has made no public promises about what his administration would look like, it is safe to assume that those who have fought for his candidacy would also be welcome in his Annapolis office. Some of those people could serve to undercut Ehrlich's message of squeaky-clean change.\ Among them are state Sen. Clarence M. Mitchell IV, a Baltimore Democrat who has been active in rallying support for him among black residents. Mitchell lost this fall's primary, and campaign insiders say he could end up working in an Ehrlich administration. Mitchell was reprimanded by his Senate colleagues this year for unethical behavior in connection with an undisclosed loan.\ Lobbyist Bruce C. Bereano, once convicted of felony mail fraud, has worked aggressively for Ehrlich's campaign and is expected to have Ehrlich's ear if he becomes governor.\ Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.\ Age: 44\ Home: Timonium, Baltimore County.\ Education: Princeton University, B.A. in politics; law degree, Wake Forest University.\ Family: Wife, Kendel. A 3-year-old son, Drew.\ Experience: Attorney at law office of Ober, Kaler, Grimes & Shriver, 1983-1994. Maryland House of Delegates, 1987-1994. U.S. House of Representatives, 1995-2002.\ Running mate: Michael S. Steele, attorney and former chairman of the Maryland Republican Party.\ THE ISSUES\ Economic development\ Ehrlich says he would increase minority access to state contracts, and start a pilot program to help fund minority start-up companies. He plans to improve the stature of the Department of Business and Economic Development by aggressively promoting Maryland's business opportunities.\ Education\ Ehrlich says he would fully fund the Thornton Commission recommendations for increased public school spending of $1.3 billion over six years. He plans to convene ""Thornton II,"" a panel that would look at teaching practices such as social promotion and phonics. He plans to push for passage of charter school legislation. He supports school vouchers, but says they are a ""non-starter"" in Maryland.\ Abortion\ While Ehrlich generally supports a woman's basic right to have an abortion, he has opposed using public money to pay for abortions and would like to ban late-term abortions. However, he says he would not seek changes to Maryland's abortion laws.\ Guns / Crime\ Ehrlich vows to bring Project Exile to Maryland, a program in which criminals convicted of certain gun crimes get harsher federal prison sentences, often far from home. He wants to review some state gun control laws to see if they're working, such as ballistic fingerprinting for handguns and the Handgun Roster Board, which decides which gun models can be sold in Maryland. He proposes overhauling the Department of Juvenile Justice, giving the state education department responsibility for schooling detained youths, and increasing drug and mental health treatment within the system.\ Environment\ Ehrlich promises to upgrade the state's sewage treatment plants, which many agree is the largest source of water pollution in the Chesapeake and its tributaries. He says he would ""revisit"" a law designed to limit agricultural runoff into the bay, to encourage compliance.\ Health care\ Ehrlich pledges to make more drug-treatment beds available in Baltimore, and to expand access to health care for the poor, but has offered no specific plans to do either. He says he would lobby the federal government to increase Medicaid funding to the state.\ Budget / Gambling\ Ehrlich contends he can repair the $1.7 billion budget shortfall without sales- or income-tax increases, and without laying off state workers. Rather, he wants to raise money by installing slot machines at racetracks -- a policy he estimates could raise as much as $800 million a year once it gets rolling. He has not ruled out increases in gasoline tax and other levies. He proposes saving money through 4 percent cuts to state agencies, and by offering early-retirement incentives to state employees, and not filling the jobs of those who leave.\ Economic development\ Townsend says she would further support the Maryland Technology Development Corp., which she helped launch, and would provide targeted tax and investment incentives for biotechnology companies and those in other fields. She pledges to create ""rapid response teams"" to provide small and minority-owned business with technical assistance, and says she would convene a Governor's Council of Economic Advisors.\ Education\ Townsend promises to fund the recommendations of the Thornton Commission to provide an additional $1.3 billion over six years for public schools. She pledges greater assistance for early-childhood education, and is backing smaller class sizes and greater help for principals and teachers, without identifying funding sources. She wants character education in every school, and says she would help place experienced principals in the lowest performing schools.\ Abortion\ Townsend is a vocal supporter of a woman's right to choose, and has received endorsements, money and other assistance from pro- choice and women's groups, including EMILY's List, Planned Parenthood and the National Organization for Women.\ Guns/Crime\ Townsend has pledged to keep tough gun laws on the books, and has proposed expanding the state's ballistic fingerprinting program to include certain assault weapons and automatic weapons. She has pledged to expand her HotSpot Communities initiative to turn troubled neighborhoods into places with good schools, drug treatment and jobs. She says the juvenile justice department she oversaw is being reformed, and that drug treatment will be expanded.\ Environment\ Townsend says she would continue and refine Gov. Parris N. Glendening's Smart Growth policies, in part by reinvesting in older neighborhoods. She says she will work to implement the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, and will work to restore streams that flow into the bay, and would keep sewage out.\ Health care\ Townsend has a plan to lower prescription drug prices for thousands of senior citizens, and says she would expand a children's health program to include their parents. She says she would invest more in community health centers, and would make sure people with disabilities get subsidized health coverage so they can hold jobs.\ Budget/Gambling\ Townsend's plan for closing a $1.7 billion state budget gap over the next two years relies on a combination of cuts, transfers and the possibility of a tobacco tax increase. She has also proposed selling a portion of the state's tobacco settlement revenue stream to get money upfront. She has called for a top-to-bottom review of all departments, and has pledged not to decrease local aid or public safety funds while increasing spending on education. She is opposed to expanded gambling through slot machines, saying social costs would outweigh benefits.\ Credit: SUN STAFF"

Special session
\
Regarding the story headlined ""Franchot: Special session premature"" (The Capital, Sept. 27):
\
State Comptroller Peter Franchot had it right. He feels it would be unwise to hold a special session before the end-of-the-year revenue estimates are complete, when the governor and lawmakers will know more about the condition of the state economy.
\
Gov. Martin O'Malley's media blitz about the need for a special session should be more carefully analyzed.
\
For a special session to be successful, a deal has to be agreed to in advance by the leadership and lawmakers in the fiscal committees. This has not happened. The governor, Senate president and speaker of the House appear divided on the need for and contents of a special session.
\
Legislators who do not sit on the key committees (about 75 percent of the legislature) will essentially be excluded from the formation of the comprehensive legislation. This means that the district legislators of many Maryland voters will have little influence on the outcome.
\
A special session reduces the safeguards put in place to assure the public of open and transparent government. It would not allow enough time for complex issues, such as reforming our state tax code, to be fully debated through public hearings and careful consideration by all parties.
\
When controversial and complex issues are forced into a special session, limited debate occurs and public participation is significantly reduced.
\
With so many legislative issues up for discussion - such as the increase in the state sales tax, slot machines, the gas tax, corporate tax loopholes, access to health care, etc. - would it not be more efficient and fairer if we waited for the state comptroller's end-of-the-year revenue forecast and acted on it more prudently, in the regular session?

Academy football
\
In an editorial (The Capital, Oct. 5), you pointed out that, in football, the Naval Academy plays Atlantic Coast Conference teams like Duke and Wake Forest, so ""it is only logical that it also play (the University of) Maryland, in the same conference.""
\
It may be logical to you, but it is certainly not logical to me.
\
Duke and Wake Forest have just a slightly larger enrollment than Navy, whereas Maryland's is six times as large.
\
More importantly, Duke and Wake Forest emphasize academics. I don't know the graduation statistics for Maryland's football team, but if they are anywhere near the zero-graduation-success rate just reported for its basketball team, academics are not emphasized nearly as much as size, speed and athletic ability.

Market House
\
The editorial headlined ""With Market House debacle, city botches an opportunity"" (The Sunday Capital, Oct. 7) and many articles on the same subject before it missed one simple observation.
\
The Market House is a local entity and should always be treated as such. Bringing in a Washington, D.C., management company - especially one as unresponsive and ineffectual as Site Realty - makes no sense.
\
At Park Place and the Annapolis Towne Centre at Parole, nonlocal management can align itself with development because it attracts national entities, which is appropriate.
\
There is also a bustling local economy at places like Main Street, West Street and City Dock. It celebrates the unique personality of our magical town and shares it with locals and visitors alike. To ask a distant, formulaic management company to know how to represent that uniqueness is a severe misstep.
\
The proposal for leases for an open farmers market is a strong start toward keeping this part of Annapolis from cookie-cutter development. Bringing support to downtown elements is the best way to support the downtown economy and avoid another Market House debacle.

Taxes Every time there is a legitimae need to raise money to support government services, we hear an outcry from Republicans that only more cuts in spending will solve the problem. Their methods for achieving tax savings include privatization, deregualtion and gutting the social safety net. These exteme fiscal policy makeovers have incrased the national debt and wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on undelivered services, inferior weaponry and shoddy workmanship on nobid contracts award to Halliburton, Bechtel and Blackwater, USA, President Bush refuses to enforce our laws and downsized the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safeaty Commission and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, putting citizens at risk. This contagion reched state and local governments. Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. defanged the Maryland Department of the Environment. The residents of Gambrills are still paying the price. Since 1999, hazardous waste from fly ash has been pising their wells and polluting their air. County Executive Janet Owens _ who was not a Republican _ gutted zoning enforcement and promoted sprawl. Remember Dobbins Island? Gov. Martin O'Malley is obligated to serve the common neds of a growing population by sustaining adequate funding for education, police and fire services, water and sewer services, and roadway construction. These are all core government responsibilities, none of which should be privatized. Mr. O'Malley has made his cuts. It's now time to stop corporate welfare by closing tax loopholes, and to raise the sales tax to 6 percent on goods and services _ not on food. We should create a fair, graduated income tax but rethink slot machines. Gambling and gaming are addictive and desrictive to families. I never asked for a free ride, but I expect my taxpayer dollars to support a strong, efective, funcitoning government. MARYELLEN O.

264,"Former city homicide chief will be a tough act to follow\The recent changes in the Baltimore City Police Department's homicide unit have left me shaking my head in wonderment (""Baltimore Police name new homicide commander,"" Oct. 14).\Police Commissioner Frederick H. Bealefeld III told The Sun last summer that he had removed Major Terrence McLarney from his post as commander of the homicide unit because of a drop in the number of murder convictions.\Major McLarney was a seasoned expert who also possessed a law degree. Most of us understand that conviction is a complex process between investigation and prosecution.\Your story also reported that a national search had failed to uncover a qualified replacement. Really? This at first appeared to have been testimony to Mr. McLarney's irreplaceable expertise.\However, when Mr. McLarney was replaced by an individual with no homicide experience, the egocentric needs of the police commissioner in this transition became apparent.\I am appalled that such an important position has been subjugated to the poor judgment and egotistical whims of someone who has yet to prove his own leadership ability.\Kenneth W. Diehl, Towson\Waste-to-energy incinerators can be cleaner\Your recent editorial regarding waste-to-energy plants (""Clean power or dirty air,"" Oct. 17) is quite good and correct. But I would like to add something you did not mention.\Turning waste to energy is polluting our environment. But ceasing to burn it is not the best option. Although recycling more waste is a wonderful ideal, much of the waste at the incinerator is there and will continue to be there because some people probably will never recycle some or any of their waste. So that waste must be burned or buried. What needs to be done is to require that these waste-fired incinerators use more environmentally friendly facilities. Then burning is the better of the two options.\Those cleaner incinerators can capture and re-burn particles in the smoke before it can be discharged into the atmosphere. These types have been available for many years. Many coal-fired power plants now use such incinerators. That is likely the reason that the four largest coal-fired plants in Maryland are producing less pollution than the waste-to-energy incinerators.\The newest ones are better than earlier models. Of course there is some extra cost involved, but the issue here is not the cheapest way to produce power. Our legislators need to take the lead in requiring such incinerators. This is a public health issue involving both our water and air.\Kurt G. Wenzing Jr., Westminster\Redistricting puts party ahead of voters\The gerrymandered congressional redistricting plan approved by the General Assembly is self-serving and cynical. The heavy-handed manipulation of Maryland's voters is a crass perversion of how districts should be drawn, and it points up the corruptive danger of long-term one-party rule.\Supreme Court rulings and federal laws require that congressional districts must be contiguous, compact, and equally populated. Please explain how any of the new districts meets the definition for being compact.\The plans sacrifice citizens' representation for the interests of the Maryland Democratic Party. Instead of holding together local communities, the districts are designed to stamp out one of only two Republican districts by cynically manipulating minority representation.\Maryland Democrats may have the power to ram through self-serving re-redistricting, but they will further corrode the political process and alienate the citizens of this state.\Melvin Barnhart, Randallstown\Gas tax: Why should we trust Annapolis?\Years ago, politicians in Annapolis instituted a gasoline tax and dedicated the proceeds to transportation and roads infrastructure. There were even safeguards in place to ensure that the money was spent only for such projects.\But over the years, the politicians flouted their own laws and the transportation fund was raided to balance the budget. The transportation system and roads suffered as a result.\Now the politicians in Annapolis are proposing a significant raise in the gas tax - and once again it's with the sole stated purpose of using the money for transportation infrastructure.\I guess this time they are making a double pinkie promise that all the money really, really will be spent on transportation projects this time.\It reminds me of that old saying: ""Fool me once ...""\Leslie Kuff, Lutherville"
265,"A diverse coalition of business groups, unions and transit advocates is urging Maryland voters to put a constitutional ""lockbox"" on state transportation funds, making it harder for governors and lawmakers to divert the money to other purposes.\Andrew Feldman, a spokesman for the coalition, said more than a dozen groups will contribute money to back Question 1 on the Nov. 4 ballot, which would for the first time give transportation funding explicit protection in the state Constitution. \""It's going to be a full effort to communicate with as many voters as possible to make sure they understand the question,"" Feldman said. \The General Assembly approved a constitutional amendment last year intended to curb the transfer of money from the Transportation Trust Fund to the general fund to balance the state budget. That's a budget tactic that has been used by every governor since Harry Hughes in the 1980s, but critics say the diversions have weakened public support for necessary increases in transportation funding. \The amendment, sponsored by Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, passed in tandem with the Transportation Infrastructure Investment Act of 2013, which raised the state's gas tax for the first time in two decades. Some lawmakers who supported the bill did so only after assurances that the ""lockbox"" amendment would pass. \Legislative approval of the amendment leaves the final word up to the voters. \Proponents say they have seen no signs of organized opposition to the lockbox amendment, but Feldman said they want to make sure puzzled voters don't say no reflexively. ""The biggest hurdle will be the wording of the question and the current political environment,"" he said. \Del. Andrew Serafini, a Washington County Republican, agreed that no organized opposition has emerged. But he's urging voters to vote against what he calls a ""worthless"" amendment. \""It's not a lockbox. It's not very difficult to get past,"" he said. \The lockbox amendment was written to put a barrier around the state's roughly $4.6 billion Transportation Trust Fund, which is financed with revenue from the gas tax, titling taxes, vehicle registration fees and other sources. \But lawmakers didn't want to make it impossible to use those funds to balance the budget in dire circumstances. The proposal protects only core state transportation spending -- not aid to local governments for fixing roads. \The amendment would allow the transfer of those funds if the governor declares a fiscal emergency, and lawmakers in each chamber agree with a three-fifths vote. \Some Republicans believe the three-fifths requirement is inadequate. Democrats alone hold more than three-fifths of the seats in the House and the Senate. \Feldman, a principal in the public relations and marketing firm Feldman Deeter Strategies, said the backers of the amendment include the Greater Baltimore Committee, the Maryland Association of Realtors, AAA Mid-Atlantic, the Maryland Chamber of Commerce, the carpenters union, and several transportation and construction trade associations. \He said the coalition, called the Committee to Protect Marylanders' Transportation Trust Fund, expects to have a budget of $400,000 to $500,000 and to run TV and radio ads. \Spokesmen for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Anthony G. Brown and Republican rival Larry Hogan said their candidates support the amendment. \Del. Herb McMillan, an Anne Arundel County Republican, shares Serafini's concerns. ""It has as much strength as a wet paper bag. A hamster could get out of it,"" he said. \Nevertheless, McMillan said he will probably vote yes, in the hope that Republicans someday would have the numbers to block such moves. \Donald C. Fry, president of the Greater Baltimore Committee, said his organization has been seeking an amendment that would protect the trust fund for years. He said the three-fifths requirement would reinforce the message that citizens expect transportation revenues to be used for their intended purposes. \""This is a situation where the perfect should not be the enemy of the good, and this is clearly a good protection,"" he said. \michael.dresser@baltsun.com\Credit: The Baltimore Sun"

Bridge solution
\
An Editor's Notebook item (The Capital, May 8) called attention to the complaints of Kent Island residents that they have been left out of the debate over who has the right to use local service roads. This problem arises from motorist attempts to leapfrog the long lines of traffic backed up at the Bay Bridge.
\
You called for a ""another span across the bay."" But this is a long-range solution that won't be available for a decade or more. Something must be done long before that.
\
The causes of the Kent Island and Western Shore backups are quite different, and they will require different solutions. As you noted, the eastbound delays are caused by motorists stopping to pay tolls. The westbound delays are caused primarily by the renovation work now proceeding on the westbound lanes, a problem that should be relieved when all three westbound lanes are back in operation.
\
But the eastbound backups won't go away until the tollbooths are removed, or a new crossing is built. A compromise would be to suspend the actual toll-taking and wave the traffic through during the busiest hours on weekends.
\
I called for this approach in my letter last year (Readers' views, Aug. 7), in which I noted that a small gas tax increase would be enough to compensate for the loss of toll revenue. I calculate that a 1-cent-per-gallon increase would cover it.
\
My argument was that a gas tax increase is the most efficient way to raise the required revenue because motorists would not be required to converge upon a single point (the tollbooths) to make their payments.
\
Gas stations are everywhere, tax collection at them is automatic, and we have to go there anyway.

Schooner's sinking
\
The headline on the front-page Associated Press story on the loss of the Pride of Baltimore (The Capital, May 3) was ""Book says authenticity of Pride led to its doom.""
\
The article reviews ""Pride of the Sea"" written by Tom Waldron and reports his conclusion that, because the schooner was from a historical 1812 design, she was somehow destined to sink. As her builder and first master, I can assure you that this fanciful supposition is not true.
\
Because of her historical authenticity, Pride did require considerable knowledge to sail. She was a true clipper schooner and most who sailed in her cherished the challenge. Riding a racehorse is a similar feat. Neither pursuit is intended for the novice. Advocating that historic ships be dumbed down to tour boats is like asking that racehorses be limited to pony rides. Most devotees would rather enjoy the real thing.
\
When the Pride was confronted by a vicious white squall, she was knocked on her side. She subsequently sank because someone neglected to close the companionway hatch and the hull flooded. The cause is clearly documented. This was not ordained in the original design and construction.
\
The vessel was properly fitted with a sliding hatch cover that would have maintained her watertight integrity until she righted herself (as she did) a few minutes later. Leaving the hatch open when it was obvious that the squall would strike was simply a fateful mistake in seamanship.
\
The celebrated Pride of Baltimore was in continuous service for nine years. She carried both professionals and apprentices safely over 150,000 miles, but she was certainly not for the faint of heart. The author is blaming the horse for mistakes by the rider.

Support HOME
\
Sen. Barbara Mikulski is delivering on a promise to solve this country's housing problems through support of a new $2 billion HOME program. The program will channel funds directly to state and local governments to finance homeownership and rental housing programs through partnerships with private, non-profit and other community organizations.
\
The HOME program squarely places responsibility on the community itself for the design, development, management and affordability of housing. This approach makes sensible use of each community's existing housing stock, foreclosed properties owned by the government, developable land and other resources. In Maryland, it means the flexibility to rehabilitate row houses in Baltimore city or build affordable single-family homes in Caroline County, whatever the community determines is most appropriate.
\
This month an appropriations conference committee on which Mikulski serves will decide whether HOME receives funding. Let's hope, for the sake of homeless people and working families who so desperately need livable, affordable housing, that Mikulski prevails.

Higher gas tax key to sound energy policy
\
Your July 19 editorial expressed concern for the harm done to the environment by automobiles. And a column by Robert McConnell, titled ""Strangled by the automobile"" (Other Voices, Sept. 13), reiterated that theme. I agree with both articles.
\
A recent Wall Street Journal poll found that 27 percent of the respondents would accept a 25-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax as a means of encouraging conservation of gasoline.
\
I propose a tax of $2 per gallon on all gasoline and diesel fuel and an import fee on imported oil equal to 90 percent of the difference between $25 and the actual purchase price. This would reduce consumption by approximately 26 percent, plus raise enough money to offset a reduction in Social Security taxes from the present 7.65 percent of taxable wages to 2.65 percent of taxable wages.
\
If 27 percent of the Wall Street Journal's respondents were willing to accept a 25-cent-per-gallon gas tax, which would be all out of pocket, how many more would be willing to accept a larger tax that would be refunded in their weekly pay check?
\
Such a plan is the basis for a sound, workable and successful energy policy that will provide many other benefits as well.

Gay rights
\
In response to the Sept. 13 letter from Loretta Ducote on the Baltimore County Council's consideration of a measure to extend protection from discrimination to gays: We are not asking for endorsement or acceptance of our lifestyle.
\
We know we are good people, respected and appreciated in our community. We are teachers, policemen, firefighters, grocery store clerks, nurses, doctors, security guards, salespeople. We live and work among you. We serve you in countless ways without standing out as homosexuals. Yet because we are homosexual, we are different from you; you are different from us, too. You take for granted that your job is secure, your place of residence is your choice, and that where you eat and sleep is safe and protected. Not so for us.
\
Our lifestyle is not an alternative for us. It is definitely not an alternative for you. The origin of homosexuality is as complicated as the origin of heterosexuality. You cannot be a homosexual, and we cannot be heterosexuals. Quite simply, we are the persons we are! We are equal.
\
Ducote uses a study {by biologist Simon LeVay, showing that homosexuality is genetic} to support her own a priori assumptions, then flippantly states that even the biologist himself accepts those assumptions. Bad logic, bad science.
\
It is time for equal rights and equal protections under the law for us all. Those who suggest we do not need them are the very ones who abridge them. As we are equal, let it be recognized and protected. Let us not judge on differences. Let us be aware of our mutual gifts and graces, equally protected.

268,"State is working to incorporate more physical activity in schools\I read with great interest the article regarding the Roland Park Middle School parents' concerns in the article, ""All work and no play for kids"" (Sept. 24). It is so reassuring to hear about parents who are engaged in their children's schools and especially when they are taking an interest in their physical activity level.\Often times, school leaders may think that academics and physical activity are mutually exclusive. The research on this issue is very clear and has shown time and time again that those students who have an opportunity to be active during the school day have better attendance, academic achievement, relationships and overall health.\While physical education is where students should learn technical skills, tactics, sportsmanship, fitness principles and teamwork, structured activity in the core disciplines can enhance the learning process, be safe, and can be consistent with what is already being taught in the classroom. After school activities and recess time can also provide students an outlet to have fun, relieve stress and run off extra energy. All of this will promote an enhanced learning environment and better climate in the school.\At the Maryland State Department of Education, we are happy to be working with underachieving schools in Baltimore City as a part of the Race to the Top Grant to incorporate student services like enhanced physical activity in the school day. We appreciate the opportunity to assist these schools in this area, among others as they see appropriate. We know the students will also appreciate this collaboration as well, as they, too, know that learning does not always happen sitting down.\A.J. ""Tito"" Baca Jr., BaltimoreThe writer is the Maryland State Department of Education's Race to the Top Grant program specialist for physical activity.\The act of giving should be its own reward\While Sean Smeetson's generous contribution to the community is commendable, his bemoaning proposed limits on tax deductions for charitable contributions diminishes the moral value of such contributions (""Don't punish the philanthropists,"" Oct. 12).\Derived from the Greek words meaning ""love of mankind,"" philanthropy refers to a freely given action that benefits humanity and that usually involves some sort of uncompensated sacrifice.\No doubt tax incentives do increase the amount that wealthy individuals and corporations are willing to give. But they are also valuable government subsidies targeted at those already blessed with the wherewithal to give, not at those who are in most need.\Decreasing tax deductions for charitable contributions and diverting the money directly to the public good would more than offset any reduction in private giving, confer genuine meaning on philanthropic acts, and punish no one.\Irwin Fried, Baltimore\The Supreme Court's dangerous positions\Dan Rodricks' recent column (""Justice Breyer, the supreme explainer,"" Oct. 13) points to a historically important incident which exposes the real danger inherent in the Supreme Court's decision-making power, politically speaking.\In the Bush v. Gore decision in 2000, the Supreme Court handed George W. Bush the presidential election on a 5-4, politically driven vote by the court to stop the recount in Florida. Today, all the Republican Party needs to do, it seems, is sweep in the money afforded them by the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling.\I am one who cannot bear the thought of a return to the Bush/Cheney administration's disastrous eight years, during which the Clinton budget surplus was turned into the present economic swamp (in large part due to the illegal war in Iraq, predicated on non-existent weapons of mass destruction).\President Barack Obama, on the other hand, won his overwhelming grassroots election in 2008 honestly and continues to stand by his conviction that a healthy government must have true bipartisan congressional rule of law, while Republicans, egged on by tea party extremists, exploit their ""my way or the highway"" steamroller agenda.\The Supreme Court must abstain from politically tainted views if it is to be trusted at all. In the long run, history will expose the truth as it was and is.\Elizabeth Goldsborough, Owings Mills\Maryland's proposed gas tax increase is a travesty\A gas tax increase is uncalled for and will create an unnecessary burden on Maryland citizens who are already overtaxed as it is. The proposed 15-cent a gallon tax hike will spell disaster for those who depend on their cars to get around.\Under no circumstances should the gasoline tax be increased by as much as 1 cent. Enough is enough in this tax-and-spend state.\Al Eisner, Silver Spring"
269,"AS DUST settles from the contentious global warming conference, the cry goes up from both extremes of the environmental lobby: ""Seven percent? You've got to be kidding!""\That the United States has agreed to a 7 percent reduction below 1990 levels for U.S. heat-trapping emissions is seen as insufficient by many wildlife lovers, but as an impossible and economically disruptive goal by some industry groups. Dithering over details will continue, but it's time for immediate action.\After the 1992 Rio conference, the United States passed no significant climate legislation and made scant progress toward a commitment to cut emissions. After five years of such waffling, we cannot afford a Rio replay. If the recent Kyoto agreement is to work, we must take a leadership role by creating a major national plan for cleaning up tailpipe and smokestack emissions.\Of course, our dependence on automobiles is a big contributor to the pollution problem; some 25 percent of our annual output of carbon dioxide (a major cause of global warming) comes from cars.\Furthermore, our increasing supply of motor vehicles forces us to import more oil.\Therefore, let's toughen our laws regarding motor vehicles by instituting a plan that will give economic incentives for U.S.-based automobile manufacturers to produce lighter, more energy-efficient vehicles. Those who want to drive gas guzzlers may do so, but they'll pay a price.\Here's the plan:\Place sport utility vehicles and minivans (now classified as trucks) under the automobile fuel-economy requirements. And by the 2003 model year, require them to meet today's standard for cars of 27.5 miles per gallon.\Require government agencies to purchase fuel-cell vehicles, which use gasoline to help generate electrical power, as soon as they become available. A rise in demand for such vehicles would help bring production costs down, making them more desirable to consumers.\Impose a 1-cent per gallon gas tax through the year 2010. That money would go to U.S. automobile manufacturers to help subsidize the conversion of plants for the production of lighter-weight vehicles.\Make it mandatory for insurance companies to link liability rates to vehicle weight.\Have each new vehicle purchased carry a graduated tax based on vehicle weight. For the next five years, proceeds from that tax would go to U.S. auto manufacturers proportionally by market share. For example, the purchaser of a Chrysler Cirrus, in the ""middleweight"" cars of 3,000 to 3,499 pounds, would pay an extra $75. But the purchaser of a heavyweight vehicle (5,000 pounds or more) like a Ford Expedition, would pay an additional $600.\The 1-cent gas tax would generate about $830 million per year for American auto manufacturers. The additional sales tax would have netted $36.9 million from sales of 1996 Chevy Blazers, and nearly $30 million from sales of 1995 Lincoln Town Cars and $256.8 million for 1996 full-size sports utility vehicles.\A bonanza\More than $1 billion in subsidies would be returned each year to manufacturers during the first five years.\Applying automobile Corporate Average Fuel Economy or CAFE standards to minivans and sports utility vehicles (2 million sold in the United States in 1996) would raise overall new passenger vehicle mileage by 2.6 mpg, saving an average of 46 gallons of gas per new vehicle per year. It would cut overall new vehicle carbon dioxide emissions by 10.4 percent.\National savings: 42.4 million barrels of oil needed to produce that additional gas for the 15.5 million new vehicles predicted for 1998's model year. If crude oil stabilizes at roughly $18 per barrel, that's equivalent to $763 million in imported oil per year -- and almost 8 percent of 1995 petroleum imports from vulnerable Persian Gulf states.\We would see improved manufacturing efficiency and new jobs in energy conservation research and development. We would slow our growing dependence on foreign oil and increase the marketability -- and sales -- of U.S. cars in the international market. The penny-per-gallon gas surcharge would be returned to consumers through lower vehicle fuel consumption.\Passing laws that would put this plan into effect would help re-establish a credible environmental policy for the United States.

Martin O'Malley and Maryland Transportation Secretary Jim Smith approximately $780 million annually to spend across the state: $580 million in highway formula funding and $200 million in transit formula funding. \The cause of the Highway Trust Fund's insolvency is threefold: big improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency, reduced driving and inflation. The last time Congress increased the gas tax was in 1993 from 14.1 cents per gallon to 18.4 cents per gallon. These three factors have resulted in lower gas tax revenues, reduced purchasing power and trust fund receipts not keeping up with demand. \A bankrupt Highway Trust Fund means the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) would stop receiving $80 million a month in reimbursements from the U.S. Department of Transportation. As a result, MDOT would have to use state money obligated for other projects to cover its federal expenditures. In other words, MDOT will be forced to rob Peter to pay Paul. New projects will not be initiated and existing projects will slow down or stop. The department also will be forced to focus solely on system preservation instead of new construction needed to improve safety and modernize our transportation network. \Maryland needs a multi-year bill that ensures the solvency of the federal highway trust fund. A multi-year transportation bill is estimated to create 2 million jobs nationwide, and transportation loans and grants create another million. Doing nothing is utterly unacceptable, and short-term extensions do not provide the planning and funding certainty states need to put those 3 million workers on the jobs necessary to maintain and improve our nation's essential transportation assets. In an uncertain economic climate, investments in transportation infrastructure create jobs in construction, engineering and manufacturing right here in the United States. \A multi-year transportation bill will help businesses succeed by making sure goods and products get to where they need to go. U.S. trade is expected to double in the next 13 years, and our national transportation assets must serve the growing economic demands for U.S. goods and services. We must modernize and maintain our infrastructure or we risk diminished profits and falling behind our international competitors in the global marketplace. \It also creates certainty for commuters and families. Traffic congestion wastes over 2.9 billion gallons of fuel each year. Maryland commuters have the longest commutes in America. \Unfortunately, the gridlock in Congress only leads to more gridlock on our nation's roads. When it comes to funding our nation's infrastructure, we've suffered from roadblocks and standstills. Despite our calls for more funding our roads, highways, bridges and railways are in dire need of repair. \That's why we work hard as Maryland's one-two punch for transportation funding. Senator Cardin serving on the Environment and Public Works, and Finance Committee creates the policy and authorizes the programs that guide infrastructure investments for Maryland and the nation. Senator Mikulski as chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee puts the funds in the federal checkbook to keep Marylanders moving. \We know strong transportation infrastructure is a key ingredient to economic growth. It protects the safety and reliability of travel and transportation. It also supports our economy with investments in the highways, public transit, airports, passenger rail and ports. This money creates engineering and construction jobs today and prepares us for jobs tomorrow bringing growth to our economy. The $13.1 billion Maryland spent in transportation over the last five years has generated $29.3 billion in business output, including $12.9 billion in wages and nearly 35,000 jobs per year. \We also know that infrastructure projects don't just happen but they require smart planning. It's why we are united with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Society of Civil Engineers, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in fighting for a multi-year transportation bill this year. \Barbara A.

No matter how you compute it, the cost of driving a car is likely to go up, witnesses told a state Senate committee in Annapolis yesterday.
\
Gov. Martin O'Malley has said the state needs to raise another $800 million each year because the transportation system is ""on the verge of financial collapse.""
\
The state should look at raising the per-gallon gasoline tax, creating a new 6 percent sales tax on gas sales, or hiking other taxes and fees, Department of Legislative Services analysts told the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee.
\
Among other long-term solutions, the state could charge more road and bridge tolls, the analysts said, and areas such as Montgomery and Prince George's counties and Baltimore City and surrounding counties could levy local sales taxes for funding mass transit systems.
\
The underlying problem, witnesses said yesterday, is that the state last increased the gas tax in 1992, even though construction and maintenance expenditures have been increasing constantly.
\
The tax rate has been 23.5 cents per gallon for gasoline, and 24.25 cents per gallon for diesel fuel, for 19 years.
\
Adding to the problem: The federal government likely will contribute less to state transportation projects in coming years. The House of Representatives has proposed reducing federal aid to state transportation projects by 35 percent, which would cost Maryland about $170 million a year.
\
""This is the new environment, the uncertainty it represents for states like Maryland,"" senior policy analyst Jonathan Martin said.
\
Increasing the fuel tax by 10 cents per gallon would raise an additional $314 million each year, analysts said, while creating a new 6 percent sales tax on fuel sales would generate about $672 million annually.
\
""The primary advantage of applying a sales tax to motor fuel is that it would allow revenues to increase with inflation,"" analyst Stanford Ward said.
\
Six states, including California and New York, plus part of Virginia, have such taxes, Ward said.
\
Another option would be to increase by 50 percent vehicle registration fees, which currently range from $50.50 to $76.50 yearly. The increase would generate $165 million each year.
\
This year, the state will receive $3.7 billion in transportation revenues, of which the federal government will provide $770 million. The next largest source, the motor fuel tax, will generate $738 million.
\
Witnesses from some of the state's major commercial organizations testified that businesses have been coming before the General Assembly for some time now to support an increase in the gasoline tax. But lawmakers have failed to act.
\
""There's only one tax the business community has come up here and gotten behind - a gas tax,"" said Jim Dinegar, president of the Greater Washington Board of Trade.
\
In calling for an array of tax and fee increases, Allyson Black, a vice president of the Maryland Chamber of Commerce, said: ""Transportation is the lifeblood of the Maryland economy.""
\
She said her organization supports raising tolls, gas taxes and vehicle registration fees, but with a caveat: There must be a constitutional amendment to keep the governor and the General Assembly from transferring money from the Transportation Trust Fund to the general treasury.
\
""A constitutional amendment is the most sure and secure fire wall,"" she said.
\
The Transportation Trust Fund was created in 1971; since 1982, the General Assembly has taken money from the fund 12 times. These amounts totaled about $671 million, according to Department of Transportation records.
\
About half of the 12 withdrawals were made because of budget shortfalls, but $37.5 million went to buy new State Police helicopters and $100 million went to repay savings and loan customers hurt in the 1985-86 savings and loan crisis.
\
The general fund has reimbursed the Transportation Trust Fund about $453 million of the borrowed money, with another $68 million to be repaid before the current fiscal year expires at the end of June.
\
Of special concern to local jurisdictions over the past decade or so: The state has failed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars it normally would have given to counties and municipalities for transportation projects.
\
It's uncertain whether the General Assembly will take up the Transportation Trust Fund during the special session slated for late October, or hold off until the regular session in January.
\
Regardless of when the debate comes, it will pit rural and urban areas against each other, especially given rural lawmakers' dislike of mass transit.
\
""Transit spending has come at the expense of highway users,"" said Sen. David R. Brinkley, R-Frederick. ""It has come at the expense of the motoring public.""
\
Transportation Secretary Beverley K. Swaim-Staley countered that mass transit has helped keep the region's traffic congestion from being even more severe.
\
""I don't think anybody would want to be traveling the Capital Beltway without the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority,"" she said.

272,"Md.: A 1 percenter's view\I was born in Baltimore County, raised in Prince George's County, attended public schools in Prince George's, matriculated from the University of Maryland College Park, and received an MBA from Mount Saint Mary's College. I have worked my entire career, approaching 30 years, within the state, dutifully paying my share of state income and personal property taxes. \And while some would tell me I am in the ""1 percent,"" I know that I am only in that rarefied air as long as I am working. I have no pension to speak of, having had it terminated by my employer. All I have is my savings -- savings based on sacrifices made by me and my family over my lifetime. And it occurs to me that I sacrifice and save to ensure a secure financial future for me and my wife. And yes, I feel entitled to pass something down to my children. \And yet if I should die early, the state feels it is due an oppressive and excessive additional ""death tax"" to further its ravenous and unbounded appetite for spending. \So I headed to the polls Tuesday with this in mind, sadly followed with the thought of how quickly I can establish residence in a state with a far more reasonable spending and tax outlook. \We tout our great school system, yet we establish policies which force our most successful to plan exit strategies to more desirable states. Is this really what you want? \Jeff Rogers \Gas tax must have restrictions \With regard to Maryland's gas tax or any sales tax increase devoted to the same purpose, we don't trust Gov. Martin O'Malley, his successor or subsequent successors (""O'Malley looks at sales tax increase for roads,"" April 4). \The transportation fund has been raided in the past, and we have no guarantees that it will not be raided in the future. If more revenue is needed to maintain our transportation infrastructure, I think most people would have no real problem with an increase in gas taxes -- if the money raised was used for only transportation. \Give us an ironclad guarantee and then ask us for more revenue. \Roger Engel, Phoenix \Want cheaper power in Md.? Leave market alone \Gov. Martin O'Malley's offshore wind bill seems to be much ado about nothing (""A better wind bill,"" April 2). Offshore wind energy is so prohibitively expensive that it is not well positioned to gain major traction in the coming years. According to the Energy Information Administration's cost assessment, offshore wind is projected to be four times as expensive as advanced combined cycle natural gas in the year 2016. With the imposition of a price cap, investment is unlikely to proceed without additional state and federal subsidies, which will inevitably be financed by the taxpayer. \Instead of chasing a dubious industry built only on a foundation of government support systems, the governor would be better off reducing government intervention in energy markets, thereby allowing Maryland residents to have the lowest electricity rates attainable. \John Monaghan, Chicago \The writer is the energy and environment legislative specialist at The Heartland Institute. \Not the best candidate but the best we've got \Unfortunately there are better candidates than Mitt Romney for the GOP nomination, but they all appear to be waiting for 2016 when they will not have to run against an incumbent president while hoping for a repeat of the 2000 election when George Bush won. The GOP should be happy, and I am glad for your endorsement of the individual who through prior experience is best qualified among the candidates to be president, and certainly that is Mitt Romney, and not individuals who have extreme views or are the subject of scandals (""For Romney,"" April 1). \It is unfitting for the Republican candidates to attack each other when a sitting Democratic president has so many negatives. Better that the Republican campaign funds be used for winning the election rather than the primaries, but individual ego always seems to come into play. \Nelson Marans, Silver Spring\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
273,"WASHINGTON - Top Democratic congressional leaders cast aside a brewing showdown over presidential oversight Monday and pitched President Donald Trump on a ""big and bold"" infrastructure bill ahead of a White House meeting on the issue, insisting there are ""significant majorities in both the House and Senate"" ready to act.\House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are set to meet Trump on Tuesday, joined by other leading Democrats. In a letter sent Monday, the pair asked Trump to entertain infrastructure legislation with ""substantial, new and real revenue"" - as opposed to previous GOP plans that have focused on using smaller amounts of public money to leverage private investments. They did not specify a dollar figure for the package, though many have discussed $1 trillion as a bare minimum.\Paying for such an investment is the major challenge, and potential revenue sources all carry political risks. Lawmakers from both parties have discussed increasing the federal gas tax for the first time since 1993, but Democrats are eyeing a rollback of the Republican tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017.\A Democratic official close to Schumer said the Senate leader would not consider a gas tax hike - which would be a disproportionate burden on working-class voters - unless Republicans consider undoing some of their tax cuts for corporations and wealthy Americans. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity.\""We look forward to hearing your ideas on how to pay for this package to ensure that it is big and bold enough to meet our country's needs,"" the leaders wrote to Trump on Monday.\Pelosi and Schumer also said any infrastructure bill must address ""clean energy and resiliency priorities"" and expand ""beyond transportation and into broadband, water, energy, schools, housing and other initiatives."" They also call for ""strong Buy America, labor, and women, veteran and minority-owned business protections.""\The Democratic leaders' emphasis on bipartisanship comes at a time when relations between the White House and congressional Democrats could hardly be worse, with Trump determined to resist virtually every effort on Capitol Hill to investigate and check his administration. For instance, Attorney General William Barr's scheduled testimony this week before the House Judiciary Committee is in question amid a dispute over the format of the hearing.\But Pelosi and Schumer have insisted on making legislative entreaties to Trump - particularly on the issues of infrastructure and prescription drug pricing, where they see a path to a bipartisan deal.\Regarding infrastructure, the two wrote Monday: ""This bipartisanship is a reflection of the American people's recognition of the need to rebuild our infrastructure to promote commerce, create jobs, advance public health with clean air and clean water, and make our transportation systems safer - indeed, to improve the quality of life of all Americans.""\Reversing any part of the 2017 tax law could be a red line for Trump and congressional Republicans, who consider the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the crowning legislative accomplishment of the administration. Undoing the cuts, some fear, could undermine a strong economy.\Democrats, meanwhile, see that revenue as crucial to any deal, and any Republican willingness to engage in that conversation stands to be an early indicator of whether Tuesday's talks are fruitful.\White House officials on Monday played down the prospect of a breakthrough at the meeting.\National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow told reporters Monday the meeting would be ""a good sit-down, a good discussion,"" but the administration would not be pitching Democrats on any specific infrastructure proposal.\Press secretary Sarah Sanders suggested the meeting could touch on topics far afield from infrastructure.\""Look, the primary purpose of that meeting is to discuss infrastructure, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised at all if immigration comes up,"" she said Monday on Fox News. ""It's a major problem in this country, and so far Democrats have refused to acknowledge it and address it.""\The House Democrats expected to join Pelosi at the meeting include Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland; Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina; Assistant Speaker Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico; Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio of Oregon; and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal of Massachusetts.\The Senate Democrats set to join Schumer are Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois; Assistant Minority Leader Patty Murray of Washington; Democratic Policy and Communications Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan; Thomas Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee; and Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee.\Credit: By Mike DeBonis - The Washington Post\Caption: Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are scheduled to meet with President Trump on Tuesday.\Andrew Harnik/AP"
274,"Smog plan puts profits ahead of health\According to the air quality chief for Maryland Department of the Environment, Gov. Larry Hogan is trying to strike a ""delicate balance"" by letting coal plants supply Maryland residents with electricity and pollution (""New Hogan smog plan fails to satisfy power plants, environmentalists,"" July 28). His claim that Governor Hogan's plan provides ""equal or greater public health protection"" than the plan created by Gov. Martin O'Malley is simply a lie -- giving power plants more leeway in curbing nitrogen oxide emissions while reducing the harmful smog created is a contradiction. Mr. Hogan's plan offers coal plants more ways to match system-wide, block average emission rates (pounds of NOx pollution per unit heat generated across Maryland). This loophole-riddled plan reads as if it were cooked up by the coal industry and artificially sweetened by Mr. Hogan before being served to the people. \Why aren't we writing regulations that motivate corporations to use pollution control technologies such as selective catalytic reduction to their fullest potentials and ensure rewards at the completion of each generation or billing cycle? When did our health become secondary to nonspecific justifications for a more ""sustainable economy"" in Maryland? The need for less pollution and more renewables is driving an ever-growing industry, and future generations will scoff at us for doing things the dirty way when we could be profiting even more by cleaning our lungs. \Don't let the governor's inability to stand up to coal lobbyists obfuscate your economic and environmental progress in Maryland. The Air Quality Control Advisory Council will review this plan on Wednesday, Aug. 5, at 9 a.m. at MDE headquarters, 1800 Washington Blvd. in Baltimore. Your presence matters! \Kevin Kriescher, Baltimore \ISIS not a byproduct of carbon dioxide \One can expect former Gov. Martin O'Malley to develop ludicrous postulates to garner the support of the radical left. The Sun may support Mr. O'Malley's bid for the presidency, but to promote a hypothesis that ISIS is an outcome of global warming is beyond the pale of credibility (""ISIS and climate change: O'Malley has a point,"" July 23). Any novice analyst would have at least reviewed Middle East history, watched ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and concluded that Mr. O'Malley is at best grasping at straws or at worst delusional. \Christianity and Islam have been at war for 1,300 years somewhere in the world, and within Islam, Shia and Sunni factions have engaged in a violent struggle during that same time frame. Christian Europe was under siege by Islam until the late 17th century when the Ottomans made their last bid to take Vienna and were then gradually pushed back to Istanbul. \The British defeated the Ottomans in World War I, destroyed the 1,300-year-old caliphate and in 1920 with their French ally, carved up the Middle East to control oil supplies for their fleet. In 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood was organized to force the British out of the region and return Islam to its past prominent role in the world. The British left in 1960. We replaced them as the last remaining colonist in the region and the Islamists turned their wrath onto us. The Muslim Brotherhood grew and mutated into powerful companion organizations in every country in the world -- the Taliban, al Qaida and ISIS are the most prominent. \The Bush and Obama administrations ricocheted from one debacle to another, deposing stable governments in Iraq, Egypt and Libya and creating political vacuums and the conditions which have lead to the current disaster in Syria, the rise of ISIS and the dominant position of Iran in the region. \The Middle East and North Africa have been excessively hot, unpleasant regions, and except for the Tigris-Euphrates and Nile delta regions, have been deserts since the beginning of recorded history. The Empty Quarter in Saudi Arabia has always been empty for good reason. \Mr. O'Malley would do better to concentrate on solutions to providing food, fuel and jobs for the 50 percent increase in the global population from 6 billion in 2000 to 9 billion in 2050 than some esoteric discussion on carbon dioxide. The Middle East and North Africa already have young populations and the regions population growth will be well above 50 percent during this 50-year time frame. Installing windmills and solar panels won't reduce their rage. \Charles Campbell, Woodstock \Mass transit a wise investment \Peter Morici's recommendation to change the gas tax to eliminate funding for mass transit and restrict it to roads is very bad economics (""Raise the gas tax, Congress,"" July 27). \Drivers benefit from mass transit. Governments spend much less tax money per rider on mass transit than roads. Many fewer injuries and deaths occur with mass transit, which reduces costs. Mass transit produces less pollution and cleaner neighborhoods and uses less imported oil. Drivers have less traffic on the road. Commuters benefit by spending less money and time, which raises their standard of living. \William Rothstein, Baltimore\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
275," Support for troops is only lip service\ Last week, light was held up to two harsh examples of dishonoring our disabled soldiers, with Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates' dismissal of two top officials at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (""Army secretary forced from job,"" March 3) and Bob Woodruff's reports on ABC about care for soldiers with traumatic brain injuries.\ Those examples demonstrated, once again, that the Bush administration's support for our troops does not go beyond lip service.\ For five years now, we have listened to members of this administration admonish those who challenged and criticized any aspect of the ""war on terrorism.""\ Those critics have been accused of being unpatriotic and of threatening the safety and morale of our troops with remarks that questioned our country's motives and strategies.\ The Walter Reed expos? showed us the inferior accommodations that returning soldiers endure at what had been considered one of the military's premier medical facilities.\ Mr. Woodruff's interviews with returning wounded soldiers and military officials revealed the evasion and denial about the number and severity of casualties from this war.\ This is a travesty. Our troops deserve better than a rally call to ""Support Our Troops.""\ They deserve better protection while in harm's way, and they deserve better medical care for their physical and psychological injuries.\ And equally important, they deserve an honest acknowledgment of their experiences at home and on the battlefield.\ Barbara Barnow\ Ellicott City\ Where was Congress as soldiers suffered?\ The questioning by members of Congress of Army higher-ups and their claims that they were surprised by recent disclosures about soldiers who returned from Iraq and Afghanistan and were treated shabbily raises an interesting issue: Just how many soldiers and their families asked their representatives in Congress for help (""Army brass lashed over Walter Reed,"" March 6)?\ Soldiers routinely contact their representatives over more- mundane problems.\ So it's inconceivable to me that something as horrific as inadequate medical care, sub-standard facilities and the bureaucratic nightmare at Walter Reed and other Veterans Affairs facilities wouldn't have resulted in a deluge of calls and letters to Congress.\ It would be interesting to turn the questions around and ask why Congress was surprised by the reports of mistreatment of soldiers.\ Lisa Mohan\ Stewartstown, Pa.\ Exploiting troops to cover bad policy\ This administration has eroded our war-fighting ability (and worldwide credibility) to an astonishing degree.\ From the scandal of inadequate body armor for the troops to aged equipment to the mistreatment of patients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (""Army brass lashed over Walter Reed,"" March 6), there is only one conclusion that can be drawn: This administration is using the troops as a propaganda tool to cover its failed, self- serving policies.\ It is not for the Democrats to answer to accusations of being unpatriotic and unsupportive of the troops.\ Instead, they should accuse the administration of gross negligence and corruption.\ Frank R. Walsh\ Catonsville\ Gas tax first salvo in state money grab\ Congratulations, voters of Maryland. You asked for it and you got it: An exorbitant gas tax increase has been proposed by state Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller (""Let the battle of the budget begin,"" March 1).\ But wait: I bet there are more goodies in the General Assembly's bag of tricks.\ Just think, we can look forward to an expansion of the sales tax to include certain services, and even better, an increase in the sales tax itself.\ These taxes will surely improve our quality of life, particularly for the illegal immigrant population, which may be granted in-state tuition rates at state universities.\ Voters, this is just the beginning: There surely will be more creative thinking in Annapolis about how to pick our pockets.\ Just wait and see.\ Anne McCloskey\ Towson\ The threat of death deters jail killings\ Once again, a correctional officer has been attacked by an inmate, although this time, thankfully, the guard was not murdered (""Inmate stabs guard,"" March 3). Once again, the inmate was serving a sentence of life without parole for murder.\ Gov. Martin O'Malley makes an appearance, bemoans the fact that this occurred, and suggests the state will act to create a safer prison environment.\ Meanwhile, the governor and some other members of his party in Annapolis are doing their best to repeal Maryland's death penalty.\ Without a death penalty, an inmate serving a life sentence knows that that he cannot be punished any more than he already is, so he can, literally, get away with murder.\ Here's what we can do, Mr. O'Malley: not repeal the death penalty but use it more frequently and more quickly.\ This would deter inmates from doing such things. And if one does so, he won't do it again.\ Clay Seeley\ Owings Mills\ Eliminate archaic act of vengeance\ The General Assembly is considering a bill that would end executions in our state (""O'Malley and Mooney discuss death penalty,"" March 3).\ As a citizen of one of the few countries in the world that still uses the death penalty, I am ashamed of the way in which we demonstrate our humanity - or lack thereof.\ Where is our understanding that some of the horrible crimes committed are directly related to the terrible parenting styles and lives some of our citizens endure?\ Where is our willingness to better our fellow humans? Where is our belief in forgiveness and, even more, the rehabilitation of a human soul or spirit?\ Given the many mistakes made in our courts (perhaps ""justice system"" is not the best title for our legal system) and the statements from many families of murder victims indicating they realize the death of the perpetrator will not reverse the tragedy in their lives, let us eliminate in our state this sign of animal vengeance.\ Marilyn Carlisle\ Baltimore\ Good golly, what a silly news topic\ The Sun sank to a new low with the column ""Good golly, Molly's 40"" (March 2).\ To take up the top third of a page with an article about a Ravens cheerleader turning 40 shows that The Sun lacks the ability to report real news.\ Does anyone really care that Constellation Energy Group CEO Mayo A. Shattuck III's wife is turning 40? I think people would rather have information on the pending increase in their electric bills, which Mr. Shattuck is involved in, or how much a private citizen paid to use a stadium built with taxpayer dollars to throw a birthday party for his wife.\ However, I'm sure glad The Sun made us aware how excessive CEO pay is spent; it will soften the blow when my electric bill goes up.\ J.

School board
\
John Leopold's recent letter to the editor regarding his school board selection plan (Maryland Gazette, March 10) should not go without comment.
\
Leopold is correct in that over the years the current selection process has been subverted through the gubernatorial appointment of individuals who did not seek the nomination process. This has led to cynicism and disappointment.
\
However, Leopold's scheme does not address the greater problem of civic involvement and civic participation. Through the establishment of a nominating convention appointed by the governor, the county executive, and other special interest groups, Leopold's plan consolidates power in a newly established bureaucracy.
\
Citizens, parents and taxpayers will have fewer opportunities to participate in the selection process.
\
It is disconcerting that Leopold, who ironically began his career as a politician upon his election to the Hawaii State Board of Education 40 years ago, believes that a panel of unelected, appointed elites should control the appointment process of those who oversee the education of our county's children. Through the creation of such a commission the ""backroom politics"" that Leopold is purportedly against will only become more ensconced as a traditional part of the selection process.
\
Furthermore, Leopold's assertion that there is consensus in support of his plan is laughable. Activists and citizens with whom I speak have expressed a clear support for a truly elected school board. Such claims of consensus from Leopold could only come from a career politician who is disconnected from the people he represents.
\
Only through the passage of legislation providing for open, competitive elections will the Board of Education become truly responsive to the citizenry and the parents of Anne Arundel County. Only through an elected school board process can our educational system be held truly accountable to voters and taxpayers.
\
Leopold's plan merely supports the existing status quo.

Liberal agenda
\
Welcome to the new Maryland.
\
With one party rule, and one party media, the liberals are on a mission to take away all of our rights and increase every imaginable tax they can think of (and if it's not already taxed, they will create one).
\
I'm afraid, but it's not of global warming. I'm afraid of our government ruining our state.
\
I'm afraid because:
\
The liberals want to prevent law abiding citizens from carrying guns, while at the same time make it easier for drug dealers to possess guns (SB 624).
\
The liberals want to do away with the death penalty and coddle violent criminals (SB 211 and HB 225).
\
The liberals want to make it easier to cast fraudulent votes in our elections assuring that they stay in office and in power (SB 1 and HB 201). They refuse to require photo identification when voting because it would prevent them from gaining fraudulent votes (HB 706).
\
The liberals intend to use my tax dollars to reward illegal aliens with tuition assistance (HB 6) and refuse to require proof of citizenship for drivers' licenses (HB 11).
\
The liberals want to increase the gas tax by 50 percent with provisions for it to increase every time the there is a price increase. They also want to increase the sales tax by 20 percent, the cigarette tax by $1 per pack, the income tax and extend the sales tax to services.
\
I'm afraid because the liberals will not be satisfied until they have taken away every right from law abiding citizens, given every right to law breakers and have taken all of our money through increased taxes. And don't forget legalizing gay marriage, banning smoking in bars and California emissions.
\
That's enough to make me start smoking.

Assault weapons
\
I disagree with your opinion on the assault ban bill, (Maryland Gazette, March 10). SB 43 is about legal semi-automatic weapons which the sponsors and now you have deemed are ""un-necessary"" for honest citizens.
\
I have read the ""first reading"" of SB 43 posted on the Maryland legislature's Web site. ""Assault"" is emphasized throughout the bill even though the guns in question are not machine guns as true assault weapon are.
\
It seems the sponsors of the bill are purposely misleading the public into supporting their bill out of fear. The bill includes so many arbitrary restrictions and interpretable descriptions that its intent is clearly much broader than advertised.
\
Honest law abiding citizens should not lose their right to choose what kind of firearms they want to own and shoot, nor should small business owners be put at risk, because legislators cannot cope with the real causes of violence and crime.
\
SB 43 will do nothing to stop violence or criminals from obtaining or using firearms in crimes. Project Exile, punishing the criminal use of guns is a better approach.
\
The grim reality is that ""we the people"" are responsible for our own defense. If the legislators, your paper and the public cannot trust and respect honest and responsible citizens, then the American experiment of liberty and personal freedom is in danger of being lost.

Cheerleading
\
What it boils down to is that cheerleading is a sport/activity (whatever you want to call it) with a lot of drama. There is no getting around it.
\
The drama is contributed by everyone - parents, cheerleaders, coaches, judges and spectators. No matter what organization or school you go to, it's there. No matter what competition you go to, being high school or all star, it's there.
\
Parents think their daughter should be the flyer, the judges were unfair, the coaches treat the girls awful, why isn't my child in the front, etc. My daughter has been a cheerleader for over 15 years and these are things we hear all the time.
\
And it's always been that way. My daughter and I have been involved in some situations and you learn to deal with them and move on. Everyone involved in cheerleading is involved in the drama at some point.
\
My recommendation - if you or your child can't handle it, cheerleading is not the sport/ activity you should be involved in. Plain and simple. The problems will always be there and they're not going to go away.

Panhandlers
\
I agree 100 percent with County Executive John Leopold's desire to ban panhandling.
\
Personally, it makes me very uncomfortable when strangers walk up to my vehicle - my private space - and solicit money or donations.
\
We teach our children and grandchildren to avoid strangers. How do I explain to my grandchildren the difference between a total stranger and a panhandling stranger? I cannot.

It's both confusing and somewhat frightening for our children, and we must protect their safety in any way possible. A stranger is a stranger. Let's not confuse our children.
\
Panhandlers, beggars and people in general do not belong along busy roads or in median strips. It is unsafe for them and for us. God forbid that a person gets hit or killed because he or she was allowed to roam into traffic or stand by the edge of the road.
\
This is a huge distraction for any driver. Many elderly people have told me it frightens them to be approached by strangers.
\
We pay for our vehicles and vehicle insurance. In return, the state provides roads for us to drive on - not to stand on, panhandle on, or use to approach private citizens.
\
I support donations and charity - just not in this way. This way is wrong and unsafe.

Mining proposal
\
The story about a possible mining operation at the site of the former Naval Academy Dairy Farm (Maryland Gazette, March 3) was beyond belief.
\
Jay Baldwin, president of Reliable Contracting, said, ""In the end we would like to see it as a preserve rather than build upon it."" Of course, this would be after Reliable Contracting and Chaney Enterprises scrape it off the face of the earth.
\
They would remove the sand and gravel that provide natural filtration of runoff. Then they propose to create a natural environment with trails and wetlands and bogs - even though wetlands and bogs do not naturally exist on the site today.
\
It is incredible that companies bent on the destruction of the natural environment believe they can create a better natural environment than that which currently exists.

277,"SEE HARD COPY FOR GRAPH\ Like a bad Hollywood serial, Maryland's mass transit systems are beginning to look like runaway spending trains.\ Trouble is, there's no rescue in sight for the taxpayers stuck on board.\ Despite much grumbling from its patrons, Maryland's commuter rail system raised fares 19 percent this month. Nine months ago, Baltimore's bus, Metro and Central Light Rail Line raised base fares 15 cents from $1.10 to $1.25, a 13.6 percent increase.\ Those are substantial fare increases. But they don't foot the bill for running and maintaining those systems.\ The money riders feed into the fare box covers only half the operating cost of mass transit. The remaining deficit is paid by the taxpayer, mostly through gasoline taxes, motor vehicle titling charges and assorted fees.\ But those same tax sources -- which collectively finance the Transportation Trust Fund -- are also responsible for building and maintaining state highways, running the state's airports and the Port of Baltimore and giving transportation aid to local jurisdictions.\ All those functions, particularly road construction, are jeopardized by transit operating deficits that are growing faster than a Beltway traffic jam.\ ""Transit deficits are a cancer that could interfere with how we finance all other forms of transportation,"" said Del. Timothy F. Maloney, a Prince George's Democrat who is chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee that oversees the transportation budget.\ The crisis is not imminent. The state will be able to foot the bill for transit next year and the year after that. But it's clear the next governor and state legislature will have to take action or watch the state's highway system crumble -- or become intolerably overcrowded.\ Consider, for instance, that between 1981 and 1993 the state spent $4.9 billion on highways and $3.2 billion on transit, a 60-40 ratio. Between now and 1999, that ratio is expected to be reversed, despite the fact that Baltimore transit ridership has dropped 20 percent over the past decade.\ Transit advocates might think it's fair to put more money into bus and rail systems even though 69.8 percent of the state's work force drives alone to work. After all, mass transit benefits the environment, lessens the need for highway improvements, saves energy and yields social benefits.\ But the money is not being sunk into transit to broaden the state's mass transit systems or to increase their capacity. Transit capital projects -- building rail lines or acquiring buses -- are not expected to take a bigger chunk out of the budget.\ No, the money is needed primarily to keep existing transit systems running.\ The Mass Transit Administration is not the only wellspring of red ink. Since last year, the Transportation Trust Fund has poured out millions of dollars to cover Washington's transit operating deficit. Previously, the state split Maryland's share of the deficit with Montgomery and Prince George's counties.\ Together, MTA and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority are expected to cost the state $2.7 billion over the next six years, more than twice what Maryland will be able to spend on highway construction.\ The result is a shrinking road construction budget even though Maryland has one of the nation's highest gas taxes -- 23.5 cents per gallon. Within a few years, more of the State Highway Administration budget will be devoted to repairing potholes on existing roads than expanding the highway system.\ ""If you use 60 percent of your budget to move 3 or 4 percent of the people in the state, it isn't cost-effective,"" said Robert E. Latham, executive director of the Maryland Highway Contractors Association. ""Frankly, I don't think the current thinking has any basis in reality.""\ There are many reasons for the rising transit costs, not the least of which is a commitment by the state to expand public transit.\ Baltimore's transit options have grown over the past decade with the addition of Metro, expansion of MARC and creation of light rail. The systems will expand further with the Metro extension to Johns Hopkins Hospital and light rail extensions to Pennsylvania Station, Baltimore-Washington International Airport and Hunt Valley.\ Metrorail in Washington is also in the midst of an expansion, adding four new stops to reach Greenbelt in Prince George's County on Dec. 11. The system, now 81 miles, is scheduled to add 22 more miles by 2001.\ Transit unions, given their protection by the federal government, have seen their members' salaries increase at a higher rate than state wages. The average WMATA employee currently earns more than $44,000 per year.\ Meanwhile, federal subsidies for transit salaries and other operating costs have not increased in 13 years. But the growth of federal mandates hasn't let up. For instance,local transit operations must provide more services for the disabled and screen employees for drugs and alcohol.\ Critics argue that part of the solution has to be to get MTA and WMATA to cut costs. But is there much incentive to do that? The Transportation Trust Fund formula essentially protects the MTA from having to compete with other state agencies for funds.\ ""If you have a pot of money that isn't under scrutiny, people will spend it very easily,"" admitted David Gunn, WMATA's general manager.\ Still, since 80 percent of any mass transit system's operatings costs are wages and benefits, there may be limits to how deeply expenses can be cut. Buses will always require drivers, mechanics and dispatchers, no matter how lean the operation.\ ""Efficiency will only get you so far,"" said Charles O. Bishop, spokesman for the American Public Transit Association in Washington. ""After that, you have to reduce costs either by cutting back service or raising fares, and both policies are damaging because they discourage ridership.""\ Ultimately, if the state wants a viable mass transit system, lawmakers will have to find another way to foot the bill. Raising the gasoline tax is an option. (Factoring out inflation, we pay less at the pump today than at any point in the 1980s).\ But that may be an option better left for the federal government than a state with a higher gas tax than any of its neighbors.\ ""We just can't stretch the state gas tax to support two major transit systems,"" said a Maryland Department of Transportation official.\ What are the alternatives?\ Ideally, transit advocates say it would be another dedicated tax, perhaps a penny on the sales tax or state property tax, that would go toward mass transit. It might also be a regional tax collected from the city and suburban counties which benefit disproportionately.\ In turn, the state legislature could relax its rule requiring the MTA to recover 50 percent of operating costs from the fare box, giving the agency more flexibility to attract new riders. With the MTA bus system losing ridership and the economy stagnant, the January 31 fare increase seemed particularly ill-timed. The October MARC fare increase might also have seemed less onerous if spread out over several years.\ But that's unlikely to happen. With runaway costs already, who wants to put up fewer roadblocks to transit spending?\ ""Once you let the fox in the hen house, the fox never leaves,"" said Delegate Maloney.\ Peter Jensen covers transportation for The Baltimore Sun."
278,"Five of the letters were not in the system therefore they are not\ LOGICAL ALTERNATIVE: VOTE REPUBLICAN\ From: Dave Chaput\ Pasadena\ The voters of Anne Arundel County have important decisions to make when they enter their polling place on Nov. 6. They have to decide whether to continue ""business as usual,"" where the taxpayers are treated merely as sources of revenue for pet projects; growth management is directed by who contributed to whose campaign; and concern for the environment runs in four-year cycles.\ The logical alternative is to vote Republican for county executive and all seats on the County Council. The Democratic Party has had a stranglehold on county government for way too many years and we have paid dearly for it. Even now with three of their incumbent council members stepping down, machine-types have been hand-picked to replace them. In District 1, they have a former council member, In District 2 they have a lackey of Glen Burnie politico Erle Schaefer's and in District 5, the sister-in-law of the District 2 incumbent is the nominee.\ It's about time the little guy has a voice in government. We must toss out the incumbents and their cronies. Otherwise we'll have four more years of the same manure -- just a few new flies!\ WEATHERSBEE LISTS HIS ACHIEVEMENTS\ From: Frank Weathersbee\ State's attorney\ I have been privileged to be in the service of my fellow Anne Arundel Countians as a prosecutor for over two decades. In that 20 years I have prosecuted and won convictions against criminals in thousands of cases, including everything from local incarceration for drunk drivers to life without parole for murder.\ For the past two years I have had the honor or being the state's attorney for Anne Arundel County. I have responded to that honor the only way I know how: with a commitment to quality prosecution that has resulted in a Circuit Court conviction rate of 95 percent. Last year $455,000 was collected and returned to victims of crimes. More than $362,000 in drug dealer's assets was forfeited.\ In my two years as state's attorney I have brought to the office a special caring for victims, a competent prosecutor corps that has been efficient, effective and professional. Simply put, in behalf of our fellow citizens, we win and put the bad guys away.\ I am particularly proud of the endorsement extended to me by the Maryland Troopers Association and the County Fraternal Order of Police. As the County Police endorsement mentioned, we're a law enforcement team with an enviable record. I look forward to continuing that winning team work. I appreciate their professionalism and am grateful for their support.\ When the Circuit Court judges unanimously appointed me state's attorney in 1988, I feel their selection was because they believed I had the commitment, experience and proven record of a respected prosecutor.\ Although Judges must remain silent, I would hope when they privately reflect on their choice they have reason to think nothing other than their trust was justified. I would hope the citizens of Anne Arundel County agree.\ EVANS STANDS OUT AS BEST QUALIFIED\ From: Mark A. Anderson\ Chairman, Democrats\ for Diane Evans Committee\ Well before the Sept. 11 primary, a number of 5th District Democrats examined the entire field of candidates pursuing the council seat vacated by Carole Baker. Diane Evans stood out as the best qualified to lead our district. As this campaign has developed, we are convinced that our judgment is accurate.\ Diane Evans' preparation for public service out-ranks Linda Gilligan in every criteria typically used to measure capability for elected office --civic involvement, environmental activism, participation in education issues as well as understanding the political and government process. The following example shows the quality difference in these candidates.\ Building East-West Boulevard to provide relief for traffic on Benfield has become a major ""litmus test"" for candidates in our district. Diane Evans articulated one position, specifically that E- W Boulevard must be built to county standards with state funding help. This is her one, and only, position. Linda has alternately opposed and supported building E-W Boulevard. Linda has gained the support of the leaders of the opposition to E-W Boulevard (her lawn signs appear in front of their homes). To the Severna Park Chamber of Commerce, she again opposed E-W Boulevard but suggested ""upgrading and connecting other roads"" to relieve Benfield. Most recently, in front of the American Association of University Women, Linda favored building the road but without state funding. Frankly, Linda's position on the E-W Boulevard is still not clear.\ E-W Boulevard issue gives us a clear indication of how well each of these candidates can size up a heated issue, make a clear decision and then have the confidence to remain true to that decision.\ Diane Evans will be a quality leader. Please join us when we cast our votes for her!!\ JIMENO SEEKS HELP TO DEFEAT LEOPOLD\ From: John McGahagan\ Pasadena\ Governor Schaefer says he is worried and I am glad. This election is the first time the governor and (District 31 Senator Phil) Jimeno have some serious political competition. It is Delegate (John) Leopold. Now there appears to be an attempt by a political machine to railroad him out of politics.\ Here's how I see it. After attending Delegate Leopold's fund- raisers it became apparent that if he wanted, he would be our next county executive.\ But not so. Governor Schaefer and (County Executive O. James) Lighthizer, I suggest, encouraged Bob Neall to run in the primary, knowing that most Republicans live in the South County where Neall resides; and they would vote for Neall. This would knock Delegate Leopold out. Delegate Leopold wisely decides to run for Senate and all the Jimeno supporters are crying foul. (A former Leopold supporter) is writing personal letters begging Leopold supporters to ask that their contributions be returned; there are complaints about anti-Leopold phone calls; (former County Executive) Bob Pascal is sending letters; the Jimeno supporters are carrying illegal literature of which Jimeno is aware; and every member of this political machine is saying Delegate Leopold is uncooperative.\ But there are contradictions in all of this. How can Mr. Jimeno solicit help from the governor when the governor has led us to the largest deficit in memory? He also has a big flip-flop on the abortion issue which Jimeno has so gallantly challenged. How can Mr. Jimeno run with (District 31 House of Delegates candidate) Joan Cadden on his ticket when she is pro abortion?\ Doesn't this cancel out your vote, ""Phil""?\ How about Mr. Lighthizer's shopping center in Brooklyn Park, the one that has added traffic lights to expose citizens to greater danger in case of an emergency. This shopping center wasn't needed since there are two shopping centers in decline already. How can I take Bob Pascal's advice (who we know is the governor's buddy now) to vote for Jimeno on environmental issues? Wasn't he in charge when Ritchie Highway became back-to-back shopping centers and two of these (Jumpers Hole Mall and Severna Park's) are in rapid decline? I wonder what his opinion is on the law prohibiting the baiting of game so people can shoot them? The political machine is confusing a lack of cooperation with its inept compromises that has led us to rising taxes and a declining quality of life.\ Mr. Jimeno could not defeat Delegate Leopold by himself so he has called on his friends to do the dirty work. It seems like he will take help from anybody to get elected. Mr. Jimeno proudly proclaims to be their leader and lists all the special interest groups in his advertisement regardless of contradiction. But now he is committed to them and Governor Schaefer, not us. Mr. Jimeno, who was appointed to his position initially and ran unopposed the second time, and the governor do not like competition.\ Governor Schaefer wants to teach Delegate Leopold a lesson for not supporting higher taxes and a lower quality of life. I say we teach him a lesson and send him a senator who will look out for the best interest of all the people in District 31. Let's not give the governor a blank check to spend our money. Vote ""Leopold.""\ GILLIGAN BEST CHOICE TO SERVE THE PEOPLE\ From: William, Christine Maranto\ Millersville\ During the next four years the 5th District will need a representative who will work to maintain and improve our level of services in a time of financial restraint.\ We need someone who will scrutinize the budget and provide fiscal accountability. The person we elect must base their decisions on facts and the needs of the people.\ After listening to both candidates for County Council, we strongly believe Linda Gilligan will best serve the needs of all the citizens of the 5th District.\ With her background she could easily choose to return to work in the private sector. Instead, she is committed to improving life in the 5th District through community involvement. For us the choice is clear. vote for Linda Gilligan!\ INCREASE IN SEWER, WATER RATES OPPOSED\ From: Louis N. Phipps II\ Annapolis\ I am an individual concerned about the recent rate increases for our county sewer and water supplies. An article in The Capital said these rates would rise to about 5 percent. The article also said these rises would ""match cost-of-living raises for county employees.""\ Hearing adults, and several taxpayers who I've talked to seem concerned as well. Politicians believe (those in the County Council and those in the county executive's (office)) these higher rates would improve sewage treatment, which is less harmful to the environment.\ I don't believe these higher rates would ""meet stricter environmental standards,"" nor would they improve the conditions. Citizens in the state and county pay too much as it is. There are already strict laws and regulations on sewage treatment for individuals and companies.\ Government doesn't need to increase rates to enforce the law. I think industry would think twice before polluting or not caring for sewage treatment if they themselves had to pay heavy fines for breaking the law.\ In extreme cases, jail time.\ FIRM OPPOSITION TO TAX CAP GIVEN\ From: William H. Norman\ Treasurer\ Fairness to All County\ Taxpayers (FACT)\ I have been wanting for a long time to write a letter about my firm opposition to Question D (property tax cap). However, I could not find the right words for me -- until recently.\ AATRG (Anne Arundel Taxpayers for Responsive Government) says that education and public safety will not be affected by their proposal. I have been waiting to see and hear specifics as to how that can be when, for example, there would be $8 million less in the next fiscal year under their 4.5 percent growth plan than that provided by the 7-8 percent actual annual budget growth experienced in the last several years. Education has to be in there somewhere.\ Tomorrow's decision-makers on budgets will not necessarily come from the ranks of today's AATRG and FACT. How can we anticipate now what future county executives and County Council members will cut? A strong Spending Affordability Committee to ""watch-dog"" Arundel Center would be a much more prudent course to take, i.e., it would come closer to insuring what we want as regards fiscal accountability and continued provision of essential services to the public.\ I gave 28-plus years to the Anne Arundel County Public Schools. I would hate to see this institution that I watched grow through the years to meet the needs of our students diminished by ""automatic"" methods. We need people at the head of this process, officials we elect to make responsible decisions about services to our citizenry and from whom we insist on dollars and cents/sense accountability for those decisions.\ Please, NO to Question D!\ EAST-WEST BOULEVARD SHOULD BE 2 LANES\ From: Mary Enzler\ Severna Park\ The two candidates for the County Council in the 5th District both support the construction of an east-west boulevard. Everyone is in agreement that a two-lane road would be sufficient to route traffic.\ However, Diane Evans supports state funding for this road, despite the fact that the State Highway Administration has stated on numerous occasions they will only build the road within a four-lane right-of-way for future expansion. Regardless or where you live, the potential for a four-lane highway in Severna Park is a risk we should not bear. A four-lane highway will transport more than just local traffic and it would encourage more commercial development.\ Since we as citizens are better able to address our needs and design a road that serves the Greater Severna Park area, it is imperative for the county to reclaim jurisdiction over the road. Diane took an early position on this road without considering the future ramifications to Severna Park.\ LEOPOLD IS FRIEND OF INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN\ From: Anthony J. Stockus\ Pasadena\ On Oct. 15, I received a letter from Mr. Thomas W. Redmond Sr. informing me that my ""substantial"" ($20) contribution to (District 31 Senate Candidate) John Leopold had come to his ""attention."" He goes on to say that he also contributed and felt as though Mr. Leopold had misrepresented himself before he abandoned his campaign for county executive.\ It seems Mr. Redmond has taken it upon himself to contact those individuals who have contributed to Mr. Leopold in an attempt to anger them into requesting that their monies be returned. I have found this blatant display of childishness to be very disturbing and characteristic of the dirty politics which Maryland is famous for.\ Mr. Leopold's decision to run for state senator rather than county executive in no way influenced my opinion of him. I base my decision on that of a candidate's servitude to his constituents. For this Mr. Leopold is top-notch. Mr. Leopold has always helped the individual citizen, which is obvious from the fact that there are more Leopold signs in front yards than there are on business fronts. Mr. Leopold will represent those who can afford little more than one vote, and wins elections through hard work, and not hate mail.\ SOPHOCLEUS FIGHTER FOR CONSTITUENTS\ From: Larry McCormick\ Brooklyn Park\ (County Executive Candidate) Ted Sophocleus, a man for all seasons. A man who can stand and fight vigorously for any cause to help his constituents. The same man can turn around and be sympathetic and helpful to the smallest needs of anyone who seeks his assistance.\ Yes, he is available to all, and his door is always open to the needs of others. This same man is always on top of the situations facing those of us in Anne Arundel County.\ This man was brought up by a very caring home. His idols as a youth were not the guys with the most money or the flashy appearance. They were the people who cared enough to give of themselves to help the youth and the needy of his community. Not knowing he was poor, he grew up emulating these same people and followed in their foot steps, helping others. Coaching athletic teams, fighting drug problems before (the cause was) popular. This sense of responsibility and desire to give of himself because others gave to him can only make him the one person we need to lead this county as its next county executive.\ Except for his sincere caring for the less fortunate in need of health care, the Brooklyn Health Association would be without a place to render its services to the public. This association started back in 1948, after offering its help in several locations, and it made a substantial investment in the basement of the Brooklyn Park High School, only to be told in 1987, with little notice, that they had to vacate. Because of this man's fight for a just cause, the Brooklyn Park Health Association has a beautiful new center in which to serve the community.\ Why anyone would want a job that takes a 24-hour day, seven days a week commitment is beyond me. Ted has the sincere desire to continue representing you as your next county executive as he has done so well in the last eight years as your First District councilman. Check his record.\ Be sure to listen to the rest, but go beyond the rhetoric, and seek out the facts. Listen to the rest, but care enough to elect the very best, Ted Sophocleus.\ UNPASSED HUFF BILLS EACH COST $2,500\ From: Roy Kampmeyer\ Severna Park\ The voters of District 31 have a right to know what legislation their legislators have produced in the House of Delegates. Each bill costs $2,500 to process.\ (District 31) Delegate (W.) Ray Huff produced the following bills:\ 1. Marine Surveyors License Bill -- this bill to license marine surveyors requires the licensee to purchase $100,000 liability insurance, but there are no standards of performance or test or training requirements to benefit boat owners who utilize marine surveyors' services to assess the structure and mechanical operations of boats. Delegate Huff owns an insurance agency and has insurance PAC money.\ 2. Commission to Tax Electric Cars Bill -- this bill would establish a tax on electric cars since they don't pay gas tax as gas- driven cars do on the highways. The delegate also has PAC money from the Greater Washington Service Station Operators.\ 3. Rockfish Fishing Bill -- this bill authorizes 55-and-over veterans to catch rockfish the second week of November.\ 4. Medical Waste Incinerator Bill -- if several hundred people sign a petition within a five-mile radius, the Department of Environment must do an environmental impact study. Why not just a bill requiring a study before any medical waste incinerator is built?\ None of the bills passed and cost the taxpayers $10,000. This is not the kind of legislator we need.\ COUNTY COUNCIL NEEDS STARR ENERGY\ From: Richard H. Oosterwyk\ Linthicum Heights\ (District 1 candidate Gerald P.) ""Jerry"" Starr is just what we will need for the Anne Arundel County Council in the '90's. His youthful enthusiasm and energy will be invaluable as he engages in the work of sensible and honest government. Jerry has and is absolutely devoted to a 4.5 percent cap on property tax increases.\ He will vote his belief in protecting those on fixed incomes, in helping first-time home buyers with more reasonable real estate taxes that will also attract companies to our county for more jobs, and (he will) vote to clean up our environment and keep it that way.\ I met Jerry Starr over 12 years ago and soon learned to admire his concern for others and his tireless work habits. He knows how to stop wasteful spending and will energetically pursue spending cuts to hold the line on taxes.\ Let's pin our hopes on a true ""Starr.""\ LEOPOLD NOT AFRAID TO TAKE A STAND\ From: Tim McGahagan\ Brooklyn Park\ As former president of the Orchard Beach Improvement Association, I would like to publicly thank Delegate (John) Leopold for all his time, effort and endless hours of support he contributed to the association during my tenure.\ I would also like to thank him personally for the stance he took with the association when we were adamantly opposing our county government on the approval of the Stoney Beach Development. As one may know, this was one of the most controversial developments that our County government had ever approved. There were many gray areas involved in this approval, such as the county not having a deed to Hilltop Road; the road not having adequate width to handle the increased traffic; the intent of critical areas legislation; contradicting surveys done for the residents and the developer; and the existing capacities of student enrollment in the affected elementary and high schools.\ This is just to name a few. With the exception of one politician, the association received no representation at all from our county government and the elected official of District 31 on these issues. To add another slap to our faces, Senator (Phil) Jimeno and Councilman (Edward) Ahearn had spoken to members of the association at a special meeting on these issues and reminded the Hilltop Road property owners not to sell their property. I suggest that these statements from our senator and councilman strongly lead the property owners to believe that the development could not be built unless the developer acquired rights-of-way to construct the road to a proper width. The senator an councilman were wrong, the residents were grossly misled and the development of 458 town houses is well on its way to completion, all on an access road that I feel is grossly inadequate.\ Delegate Leopold was the only elected official from District 31 to represent his constituents and challenge our county government publicly on these gray areas. For his effort in representing the best interests of the association, he was labeled a grandstander, opportunist, and irresponsible by county officials and other local politicians. If we had had this representation in the beginning from all of our elected officials in District 31 and were not falsely led by irresponsible statements by our incumbent senator and councilman, maybe our small association would not have had to spend $5,000 in legal fees in fighting these issues. It is a fact that a large percentage of the $5,000 came out of the pockets of the senior citizens of Orchard Beach who are retired and on fixed incomes. Let it be known that we were not fighting the developer, but our county government who, in my opinion, allowed the developer to do what he pleased.\ District 31 needs a few more leaders like John Leopold who are willing to represent their constituents no matter who they are challenging, who are independent and not intimidated by challenging the ""Good Ole Boy"" political machine and who are capable of representing all constituents in fairness and not cater to the special-interest groups.\ Support Delegate Leopold for state senator of District 31, for it will be in your best interests to know that you will be represented and that your vote will mean something.\ FORT MEADE LAND MUST BE MADE PARK\ From: Christopher Wassif\ Pasadena\ It would seem to me that not enough is being done fast enough to ensure the use of 1,000 acres for a regional park that previously was part of Fort Meade.\ The land that I am referring to is in the northeastern part of what is now Fort Meade. This land is ideal for a park, and the grounds contain Soldier Lake and part of the Small Patuxent River. Access would be no problem, as Route 32 runs parallel on the north side and Boundary Road runs parallel on the south side of the land.\ The southern part of the county is already growing at an alarming rate.\ This land, even though it is zoned low-density residential, allowing for only one house per 5 acres, cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of a developer. There is nothing to prevent a developer from buying the land and waiting for a new County Council to rezone the land.\ The state and the county together could easily purchase this land from the Army for a park that is badly needed in that part of the county. Some of the money needed for the purchase could come from the state's open-space fund. This fund was set up for the sole purpose of buying lands for parks and other facilities.\ Hopefully, the County Council and the state will see just how badly this is needed, and all of the county will be able to celebrate the opening of a wonderful new park.\ NEALL SUPPORTER IS 'RICH MAN'S LOBBYIST'\ From: Lewis Bellinger\ Pasadena\ I am writing in reference to the Oct. 23 article (""Neall enlists Dems,"" Anne Arundel County Sun,) subtitled, ""Republican recruits party's top lobbyist,"" referring to Bruce Bereano. The article should be titled, ""Bob Neall enlists the state's highest-paid lobbyist of special-interest industry.""\ The Sun paper on June 1, 1990, contained an article referring to Mr.\ Bereano as making from Nov. 1, 1989, to April 30, 1990, a total of $725,014.49. The second highest-paid lobbyist barely came close, making $381,731.27. It also stated that Mr. Bereano has 60 clients of industry.\ Mr. Bereano, a lawyer himself, states that (county executive candidate) Bob Neall knows how to run government effectively and efficiently -- how can anyone run government effectively and fairly when his top campaigner is the rich man's lobbyist? What favors will he owe him for his many clients?\ Ted Sophocleus' top campaigners are non-paid lobbyists for the people -- environmentalists, senior citizens, officers in community groups, teachers and small-business people. All they are asking for is a fair break for everybody.\ Ted knows what the average man's lobbyist is like, for he was one for his community before office, and continued so after he was elected. He lobbied against expansion of BWI runways; against an asphalt plant locating in Anne Arundel County waterways and an infectious waste incinerator. He voted for keeping elementary (community) schools open, sediment control bills -- the list goes on and on. Ted, a businessman all his life, was at one time responsible, as a budget director, for the day-to-day operation of a $75 million corporation and then later operated his own pharmacy. He brings to the county executive position the skills of corporate and small business management.\ Neall's experience is on the state level, which deals with state government problems and doesn't get into the details of the county's individual problems.\ Ted's experience is on the county level, which deals with everyday problems we all face -- traffic problems, school, police, fire, utilities, taxes, county growth, etc. He knows firsthand every district problem in Anne Arundel County. He listens to them every council meeting and then action is taken. He understands the various county departments because he interfaces often with them.\ The citizens of Anne Arundel County would do well to select as their county executive the eight years of experience of a Ted Sophocleus over the promises of a Bob Neall.\ CANDIDATE OUTLINES VOLUNTEER PROGRAM\ From: Robert G. Pepersack Sr.\ Candidate for sheriff\ Almost every major law-enforcement agency in our nation, and many smaller agencies, utilize the productive work provided by volunteer programs. In most cases, these volunteers are senior citizens who have successfully completed one life career and are looking for useful and beneficial outlets for their time, talents, skills and energy. These programs benefit the volunteer in providing a continued feeling of accomplishment and worth, while saving the taxpayers untold thousands of dollars.\ Our sheriff's office has never considered such a program, opting instead to distribute hundreds of ""deputy"" badges in an effort to influence political support. Few of these individuals have ever been called upon to perform any useful or constructive service for the sheriff's office. It is unfortunate that some individuals given these badges have misused them to identify themselves as ""deputies"" when confronted by a police officer in a compromising situation. Even if the majority of badge-holders are honest citizens, these instances have occurred all too frequently in Anne Arundel County as to lend an appearance of unprofessionalism to all members of our sheriff's office.\ I would propose to recall these badges and reissue a deputy's badge only as provided by law when special and emergency circumstances exist.\ A volunteer program modeled after other successful programs would be initiated. Those individuals participating would be asked to perform in-house, non-police duties that could relieve a certified deputy to perform essential police-related functions. Volunteers could claim a direct contribution to the cost-effective management of their government and realize the personal pride in assisting our law-enforcement community.\ These programs are viable alternatives during a period when government must become more cost conscious and continue to deliver the services required.\ BUDGET WOES SHOW LOSS OF RESPONSIBILITY\ From: Patrick J. Jose\ Severna Park\ Unquestionably the Congress -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- share some of the blame for the budget fiasco. President Bush has not helped matters. I ask, ""Who is in charge?""\ How can one forget President Harry Truman's assertion, ""The buck stops here""?\ TAX CAP IS NEW FLAW FROM CALIFORNIA\ From: Vera McCullough\ Brooklyn Park\ The only thing good about a mistake is that if we are smart we should learn from it. The concept of open-space classrooms was first used in California. By the time the concept reached Maryland, California had already decided that it was flawed.\ Brooklyn Park Elementary School was the first open-space school built in Maryland with state money and, I might add, a great deal of politics. Today we are learning what it cost to correct the open configuration of construction. Before we spend millions on new construction, perhaps we should find out how California corrected its problem.\ Another mistake that California made was Proposition 13. It has been disastrous to education! They have gone from being innovators to having one of the highest average class sizes in the nation. At the same time, the average cost per student is one of the lowest. Recently they ranked in the high 40s among all the states. The richer California school districts provide better education only through private endowments. At least in California the people thought they knew what they were voting for. In Anne Arundel County, no one knows how Charter Amendment D will be interpreted until after the election. My greatest fear is the impact this will have on our public schools. Are we going the same route as California? There has to be something very wrong with the system to allow something this vague to be placed on the ballot.\ There are better ways of ensuring that Anne Arundel County will stay fiscally sound without adding Question D to the Charter. Please vote NO.\ FINANCE SKILLS RECOMMEND GILLIGAN\ From: William Anderson\ Severna Park\ I am concerned regarding waste in county government. I want to feel confident that my tax dollars are being spent prudently and effectively, to improve the quality of life in Anne Arundel County. The taxes I pay should reflect the needs and services required by the community.\ To have a fiscally responsible government, we need to elect candidates that have the background and skills to accomplish the task. (District 5 County Council Candidate) Linda Gilligan has 15 years of experience in the finance area, five years as the budget director of the University of Maryland Hospital. She has an M.B.A. and will be completing a master's in finance. She has a proven record of financial management and a proven record of fiscal effectiveness.\ Linda has the background required to ensure the most effective use of our tax dollars while still maintaining services. I support Linda Gilligan for the County Council in the 5th District.\ BWI COMMITTEE AIDS NOISE CONTROL\ From: Ernest C. Michaelson\ Candidate, County Council\ District 2\ The BWI Maryland Maryland Aviation Administration administrator, Ted E.\ Mathison, and director of Aviation Noise and Abatement, Bob Talbert, have agreed to make every effort to work with the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) to stop the painfully noisy right turn over Elmhurst. This change in attitude has been in response to the efforts and pointed recommendations by the BWI Neighbors Committee that I chaired for four years. Key contributors to this effort have been committee members Jim Edmiston and his concerted efforts to activate Elmhurst; Tom Dixon, representing Harmans; and (my successor) Lew Maddox, representing Glen Burnie Park. All of these neighborhoods will receive less noise as a result of stopping the turn over Friendship Park one-half mile from the end of the runway.\ The new turn, now under consideration, is to make the turn over Interstate 97. By the time planes are over a neighborhood, they will be about 4,000 feet up and will bother but not be painful. The BWI Neighbors Committee pointed out that the one-half mile right turn over Elmhurst exposed the homeowners to painful 95- to 105-decibel noise levels. This level stops all conversation, television and outside activities. It also shakes houses. A turn 1.5 miles from the end of the runway causes noise from 85 to 90 decibels which is half as loud and therefore tolerable. The airport had been claiming that the right turn was noise abatement because 20,000 residents heard the planes when they turned at 1.5 miles to the left and only 15,000 residents heard the airplanes when they turned at one-half mile to the right. They had not factored in the doubling of the noise.\ The BWI Neighbors Committee that was sponsored by Senator Wagner has become a highly respected committee over the last four years with me as chairman. Our committee members have become experts in many aspects of airport expansions and quiet airplanes. We tend to laugh at politicians like (District 2 County Council Candidate Edward) Middlebrooks who have never been to an airport meeting telling the public that they will ""Halt the airport expansion."" If, by some magic, Middlebrooks did halt the airport, there would be an economic and housing collapse in Anne Arundel County as businesses pulled out. The BWI Neighbors Committee has taken the intelligent approach of keeping the airport and FAA posted on reasonable changes to their plans and operations.\ DELEGATE RAY HUFF DESERVES TO RETURN\ From: Les Ballard\ Glen Burnie\ ""Politicians -- who needs them?""\ That is what I keep hearing. As a longtime resident of Anne Arundel County, I know of one politician who was and is needed and welcomed -- (District 31 Delegate W.) Ray Huff.\ Delegate Huff has helped me personally to solve a run-off problem that has been plaguing me for over five years. After every heavy rain my driveway and hillside would wash out -- thus leaving me with extensive, almost impossible repairs. Although I contacted various county agencies, it was Ray Huff who was able to bring together the proper state and county departments and the original builder to correct my long-standing headache.\ My experience with Ray Huff has always been positive. He is a perfect example of why we need to return this dedicated incumbent to further serve District 31.\ BEST ADVICE NEEDED FOR TOWN CENTER\ From: David G. Boschert\ Councilman, District 4\ Your Oct. 21 article concerning the future of the Odenton Town Center (Anne Arundel County Sun, Cloudy future for train station, Odenton Town Center) attempts to analyze an important local issue but misses the central point of future traffic congestion.\ My concern with the Town Center Management Committee which drafted the Town Center legislation was that they did not receive the benefit of important advice from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the Maryland Department of Natural Resources relative to non-tidal wetlands in the Town Center area. While considering transportation, the committee did not receive expert advice from the State Railway Administration or appropriate public safety agencies, but perhaps most critical of all, they received only second-had information concerning traffic and roads from the State Highway Administration.\ Changes already envisioned for Route 32, together with major new housing in the greater Odenton area, will put an ever-increasing amount of traffic onto routes 175 and 170, creating an almost certain West County gridlock.\ My concern with the Town Center legislation was simply to allow time for these types of issues to be addressed.\ Public officials must listen to all of their constituents and gather the best information they can. They must have strong convictions. And in the end, when issues have divided the community, responsible public officials should act to bring the community back together. That is the task to which I am now dedicating my efforts.\ JIMENO PROVIDED MONEY FOR ROADS\ From: Dave Williams\ Pasadena\ My main interest in community association work over the past dozen or so years has been to promote road improvements in Anne Arundel County. The following are improvements either realized or currently under development:\ MD 100 - Edwin Raynor Blvd. Interchange\ - MD 3 to I-95\ MD 177 - 3 lanes, MD 100 to South Carolina\ - 5 lanes to replace the 3 lanes, with 3 lanes on to Ventnor\ - Pinehurst corner realignment\ MD 10 - MD 648 to MD 100\ - MD 100 to MD 2\ MD 173 - Stoney Creek Bridge refurbishment\ MD 2 - Church Street corner improvement\ MD 695 - widening\ MD 32 - Howard County Lane to BW Parkway\ - BW Parkway to MD 3\ US 50 - MD 70 to Sandy Point Interchange\ I-97 - MD 695 to US 50\ General maintenance improvements to many of our roadways.\ Much credit is due Senator (Phil) Jimeno and the rest of the General Assembly in providing funding for these projects. The senator's opponent in the 1990 election supported many of these improvement projects, but then didn't support the state's effort to provide resources to fund these projects. Was he counting on the Tooth Fairy?\ I urge you to vote for our responsible legislator, Senator Jimeno. He is a man of vision and of responsibility to make tough decisions and accept the realities of managing government for the people.\ LEOPOLD RENEGED ON COMMITMENT\ From: Fran Sieradzki\ Severn\ I would like to remind the teachers and other state employees living in the 31st District that in 1982, John Leopold committed himself to support our retirement benefits. In 1983, he cast one of the deciding votes to alter our pension system. The issue is not so much the vote that was cast but the credibility of a person who would renege on his commitment. Others who supported changes in the system told us up front. John Leopold did not.\ I don't believe teachers should place their trust in any candidate who doesn't honor trust. John Leopold betrayed us before - - we should not support his promotion to the Senate so he can do it again.\ OUST INCUMBENTS, VOTE IN CHALLENGERS\ From: Glenwood Gibbs\ County Council candidate\ Sixth District\ Few things are more important to Annapolis and Anne Arundel County voters than their paychecks, homes and families. This year these have special importance. All are affected by County Council election issues. For example:\ * HIGH TAXES reduce everyone's pay check. Remember: Every county budget dollar comes from your wallet; your money pays for services the County Council ""gives"" you. Since 1982, when the present council was first elected, the budget has doubled; the county now spends twice as much of your money as in 1982.\ * GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT affect everyone's home and quality of life. The quiet county we once knew has become noisier. Traffic that once flowed freely now chokes our roads. Once-adequate sewage facilities are now overflowing.\ County voters want growth and development controlled. The incumbent County Council hasn't done so, and it's time for a change. Vote the incumbents out, and bring in new blood dedicated to controlling growth.\ * EDUCATION affects every family. The school budget is more than half the entire budget, yet SAT scores have dropped. This is not acceptable.\ Education dollars are not doing their job.\ The County Council owes it to parents, teachers and children to insure that their tax money has maximum impact in the classroom. Elect new council members dedicated to excellence in education. Vote out the incumbents; vote in the challengers.\ * THE ENVIRONMENT. Forgive the cliche: We don't own this place; we've borrowed it from our children. I plan to leave my kids a clean county, and I am dedicated to working for a clean environment.\ * Finally, THE LANDFILL. Let's end the bickering and settle the problem.\ I am dedicated to exactly that. Your vote will help.\ These are my goals. I welcome your support for them on Nov. 6.\ WRITER TRIES TO CLEAR EAST-WEST BLVD. FOG\ From: F. George Deuringer\ Severna Park\ The positions taken by the candidates on the East-West Boulevard fall into four categories, i.e. (1) no road, (2) a two-lane county- built road and upgrading/connecting existing roads, (3) a two-lane road, financed with state money, using county funds as a last resort, and (4) create a task force to study this matter. While these positions may have appeal, once one considers the alternatives or tries to figure out who will or can afford to foot the bill, it's obvious that some of these positions have a hollow ring.\ (1) The alternative to ""no road"" is to upgrade existing roads to handle increasing traffic volumes, as on Benfield at Route 3 where the average daily traffic count increased from 15,150 cars to 21,015 just last year.\ Wait till the I-97 interchange is fully operational.\ (2) A two-lane ""county-built road"" means nothing if the county can't afford to build it. The cost has risen from about $5 million to $14 or $30 million, depending on the alignment and type of road. How will the county come up with that kind of money, especially if there is a tax cap? The county's public works budget for fiscal year 1990-1991 is a mere $5 million for all road and bridge construction. Who will push for more than three times that amount and explain to the rest of Anne Arundel County that there will be no money for anything else?\ Can we afford to reject state funding for the road, simply because the Shipley's Choice Homeowners Association, Brightwood and Elvaton Acres don't like a state road?\ (3) A two-lane state-funded road, which conforms to the existing section in Shipley's Choice, would be the ideal. However, shrinking state construction money may kill even that option.\ (4) Do we really want a ""task force"" to further study this issue. Hasn't the last 10 years been enough? All of this because three communities disagree with the other 59 communities of the Greater Severna Park Council?\ When will the common good come before the special interests of a few?\ Just trying to lift some of the fog.\ EVANS WOULD BRING FRESH AIR TO COUNCIL\ From: Evelyn R. Maddox\ Millersville\ Diane Evans will be a breath of fresh air on the County Council. Her compassionate yet straightforward approach to the tough issues during the campaign season leaves me with the confidence that she will cope well with the demands that are sure to face her on the County Council. She will not shirk from her responsibilities as the representative for the entire 5th District when the special interests bring the pressures to bear. I encourage all to vote for an independent voice on the County Council. That voice is Diane Evans.\ O'MALLEY MIGHT LIKE THIS SCORE INFLATION\ From: Colleen Corwell\ Severna Park\ Once again Pat O'Malley cries, ""Why can't we have more scoring in soccer?"" Why can't the scores be higher? Well Pat, I have some suggestions for you. Why don't you start your own league where goals scored in the penalty area are worth 100 points, goals scored outside the area about 200 points, and those made near the halfway line, at least 500 points. Or better yet, you could set up little goals all around the field so that the players could score at any time and any place. Of course, these goals would count for at least 100 points each to keep the scores high. The best solution for you though would probably be to eliminate that boring running, passing and tackling altogether and just have penalty kicks: That's 80 minutes of non-stop scoring. You could then have exciting headlines like ""Severna Park beats North County 72-71 in the 198th penalty shot.""\ POLICE ORDER LODGE BACKS SOPHOCLEUS\ From: Officer B. Scott Pittaway\ Vice president, county Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 70\ The Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 70 voted to endorse Ted Sophocleus for county executive by a unanimous vote. FOP Lodge 70 represents over 400 Anne Arundel County police officers, most of which are Republican. But we voted for Democrat Ted Sophocleus because in his eight years on the County Council he has been a champion of law enforcement. He has helped us obtain the manpower and equipment needed in our battle against crime and drugs.\ Your county police officers, who patrol your streets and investigate your crime, have placed their trust in Ted Sophocleus.\ COMPARING SOCCER TO FOOTBALL IS NAIVE\ From: Harry Mallinson\ Severna Park\ Mr. O'Malley's comments on the lack of scoring and excitement in a soccer game cannot be bypassed without a reply, induced or not.\ Yes, the game of soccer probably is for purists, but to compare it with football is rather naive.\ Just in any other sport, one has to know the game to appreciate it.\ For some of us to watch a basketball game, a really high-scoring piece of athleticism, is a complete waste of time unless we see the final, seemingly endless ""few minutes"" with all their time-outs and rag-waving.\ Yes, the same with indoor soccer, but this game should be treated as a training exercise for the real thing.\  At least the soccer player is allowed to think his way through and not be subject to the robotlike precision of football and the coaches' whim, aided by an army of advisers.\ If these same football players could ever be let loose on a rugby field, devoid of all their armor, then watch out for excitement -- but of course the game would be back to the thinking player, more fluent but not commercial enough to exploit.\ So, Mr. O'Malley, the game will stay as played throughout the rest of the world, goal dimensions and all, having its high and low scoring games --rather like baseball!\ Maybe when this generation of junior soccer players become parents and teach their children the game, then the general sports fan, and sportswriter, may become more appreciative.\ In the meantime, maybe you could excite us with reports on hurling, Gaelic football or the Irish bog-trotting championships.\ FRIEND SAYS EVANS HAS NO PRETENSES\ From: Cynthia Morre Andrew\ Millersville\ Diane Evans has been a friend and co-worker for a decade. In those years I have come to realize that there is no one more honest, more sincere or more dedicated to the betterment of their community than she.\ With Diane there is no pretense. To quote a cliche, ""What you see is what your get."" Fortunately for the voters in the 5th Councilmanic District, what they will be getting when they elect Diane Evans on Nov. 6 will be an intelligent, compassionate, independent advocate in county government.\ EVANS' TONE AT LUNCH COST HER THIS VOTE\ From: Missy DeBole\ Severna Park\ You recently reported on the differing styles of the two candidates running for the District 5 County Council seat, Linda Gilligan and Diane Evans. Unfortunately, the printed word cannot always equate with real-life experiences.\ I attended a luncheon at which Mrs. Gilligan and Mrs. Evans spoke, in order to become better acquainted with the candidates. I was shocked and dismayed at the unprovoked and pointless attacks Mrs. Evans made against Linda Gilligan. Mrs. Evans' conduct clearly was not in keeping with the meeting's intent or spirit. It is this kind of dirty politicking that undermines all of us and the political process.\ I would not, and could not, vote for a candidate who resorts to such groundless bashing. Linda Gilligan is to be commended for the integrity she has shown in her campaigning. She has earned my vote and deserves yours as well.\ EDUCATION STANDS WIN GILLIGAN A VOTE\ From: Molly Connolly\ Pasadena\ As an involved parent, like thousands of others in our area, I am concerned about the quality of education received by the children of Anne Arundel County. The math and science curriculums are adequate now, but with new technologies in industry to be implemented in the future, these subjects need to be promoted on an even higher level to keep pace. I would also like to see more after-school activities added to the current programs, to help our children become more well- rounded individuals during their budding years and thereafter.\ When I learned that these improvements in education are on the platform of Linda Gilligan, County Council hopeful, she earned my vote. Mrs.\ Gilligan has three children of her own, has been involved in the schools for years and knows firsthand the needs of our children and what programs and services will most benefit their educations. It is my hope that all parents in District 5, and throughout the county, will keep this crucial issue in mind on Nov. 6 at the voting polls."
279,"
Tax bills will be going up while spending goes down, slots at destination locations near Maryland's borders could become an issue, and nobody should expect a new span for the Chesapeake Bay Bridge as long as Gov. Martin O'Malley is in the State House.
\
In an hour-long interview with The Capital on Friday that ranged from the state's projected $1.5 billion deficit to the job influx coming with the Base Realignment and Closure, or BRAC, process, Mr. O'Malley described how he has tried to travel a road of compromise amidst the tough challenges heading his way.
\
Leading the state is a much different task than taking over Baltimore, the governor said, especially since the city was going ""code blue"" and Maryland is strong.
\
Mr. O'Malley - who has a fiery reputation - said the State House has to have a more patient leader to forge compromises.
\
""A lot of what we need to get done as a state requires a lot of collaboration and a lot of consensus building in the wake of four years where people kind of retreated to their corners, or alternatively, grabbed each other by the throat,"" he said.
\
The governor has taken heat from Republicans and Democrats alike for not trying to solve the budget deficit last session, but Mr. O'Malley saw the 90 days of the General Assembly session and the months afterwards as a time to build partnerships.
\
Maryland doesn't have to overcome the ""culture of failure"" that pervaded in Baltimore, but the challenges ahead will need to be solved by a united front, he said.
\
""Among many of our residents and many of our business people (in Baltimore), there was sort of this dreaded sense of 'last person out turn out the lights',"" Mr. O'Malley said. ""(Now) we read headlines that 40,000 BRAC jobs are coming to Maryland.""
\
Controlling sprawl
\
With the state needing an estimated $400 to $600 million more in transportation funding every year and BRAC infrastructure costs stretching to $16 billion - $5 billion in Anne Arundel County alone - Mr. O'Malley said the state needs to look beyond just dollars and cents.
\
More than 20,000 of those jobs should be in the Fort George G. Meade area by 2014, but the governor wants the state and local governments to revise its growth planning.
\
Since 1973, Maryland's population has grown 30 percent, but the amount of land developed has gone up 100 percent, Mr. O'Malley said.
\
The state needs to create a comprehensive plan for development across all counties to develop sustainability, he said.
\
Part of that solution could also be a ""Green Tax"" on developers who build ""in the middle of a corn field"" and need significant capital projects or remediation to make the homes viable, Mr. O'Malley said.
\
Last year, a ""Green Fund"" bill to tax any new impervious surface died in the General Assembly.
\
""The only thing I know for sure is that another 30 years like we've had since 1973 is going to leave us with a very degraded state and we won't be able to recognize the place,"" Mr. O'Malley said.
\
Part of preserving Maryland's environment, and the Eastern Shore, will be letting a future administration decide if another Chesapeake Bay Bridge crossing should be built.
\
""I'm not in favor of it,"" the governor said, adding that he has instructed John Porcari, the secretary of transportation, to look into a single-operator ferry system.
\
While touring Kent Island in May before voting down the 1,350- unit Four Seasons project, Mr. O'Malley said he saw the importance of maintaining the pastoral scene.
\
""I just turned to (aides) and I said I can't do this,"" he said. ""I can't be complicitous in turning the Eastern Shore into a suburban bedroom community.""
\
Deficit problems
\
Mr. O'Malley cut $280 million in state spending in July, and said his government will continue to look for more efficiencies.
\
But about 80 percent of the state budget is made up of education, public safety and health initiatives, all of which are necessary and difficult to slice, he said.
\
In the absence of large decreases, a revision of the tax code will inevitably mean a chunk of the money used to close the deficit will come from taxpayers' wallets.
\
""It'll come from the places it always come from,"" Mr. O'Malley said. ""It comes from all of us.""
\
The governor listed some of Maryland's economic numbers - last among the 50 states and the District of Columbia in spending as a percentage of wealth, corporate and sales taxes lower than surrounding states, a gas tax not indexed to inflation and kept level since 1992 - and said the flat income tax also will be changed so people who make large incomes pay a higher percentage than other Marylanders.
\
""I don't think too many people would scream about that,"" he said.
\
But the governor again did not give any specifics beyond general policy statements. In the coming months, the budget plan will be revealed in ""bite-sized portions,"" Mr. O'Malley said.
\
""Probably this fall we will have some leadership consensus,"" he said.
\
How quickly that consensus forms will determine the fate of the special session devoted to solving the deficit, the governor said.
\
""There is some merit to (a special session),"" he said. ""Otherwise, in the course of a whole session, I fear that other important things become kicked to the side.""
\
One of the tougher parts of getting the two leaders of the General Assembly together will be the question of slots. Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, Jr., D-Calvert, remains a supporter, while House Speaker Michael E. Busch, D-Annapolis, is against them.
\
Mr. O'Malley has frequently said he favors ""limited"" slots, a number he qualifies as being somewhere between the 35,000 passed by the Senate and the 9,500 passed by the House in 2005.
\
There is a perception the government is ""unfairly handicapping the Maryland racing industry,"" Mr. O'Malley said. Some slots - maybe even outside the racetracks - could bolster race purses and go toward the state's overflowing capital project needs.
\
""There are some in important positions in the House who believe that a couple destination locations near the borders of our competitors makes sense,"" he said. ""I'd rather not see that. I'm trying to keep an open mind.""
\
The governor also acknowledged some of the money would probably have to go toward the deficit rather than only roads, bridges and buildings.
\
""In order to put this issue to bed and get it behind us, I have to be open to compromise,"" he said.
\
While keeping an open mind on the ""auction"" concept proposed by the House Republicans that would reward licenses in a bidding process, Mr. O'Malley said a referendum would only cause delay and worsen Maryland's economic standing.
\
""If slots is part of the comprehensive mix, (a referendum) puts the rest of the mix in jeopardy,"" he said.
\
The governor made it clear he will not wait forever if Mr. Miller and Mr. Busch cannot come to an agreement.
\
""There will come a time when the clock runs out and I will need to be talking directly to the public we all serve,"" Mr. O'Malley said. ""And, hopefully, I will do it with both of them standing to my right and to my left. It could be that I'm left in a position having neither of them.""
\
Investments needed
\
But, of course, his initiatives will take money.
\
Mr. O'Malley invoked the failure of the levees in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina and the collapse of the Interstate 35 bridge in Minnesota as examples of what happens when government does not properly use its resources.
\
There are 382 bridges in Maryland with the same classification as the Minnesota bridge that fell, 12 of which are in Anne Arundel County, according to the State Highway Administration.
\
""They are not things we ever thought we would see in our lifetimes, as Americans,"" Mr. O'Malley said. ""The succession of them is leading people to ask questions about whether we are making investments.""
\
This month at the Maryland Association of Counties Conference in Ocean City, the governor said his administration will be coming out with a major transportation funding bill.
\
Mr. O'Malley criticized President George W. Bush for pledging to lower the corporate tax and not raise the gas tax only days after the Minnesota bridge collapse. The governor acknowledged both of those revenue sources will be hiked ""to some degree"" to fund infrastructure in Maryland.
\
""Are we content to live off the investments our parents and grandparents made and suck off the credits of our kids, or do we want to join the march of progress again?"" Mr. O'Malley said. ""That's really at the core of a lot of this, and to be able to talk about it and do it in a way that's not angry.""
\
Whether those problems - or solutions - are simple is another matter entirely.
\
""The world looks a lot more complicated from this perch,"" Mr. O'Malley said.
"
280,"
Since my appointment as chairman of the Anne Arundel County Veterans Affairs Commission, I have been asked many times by both private citizens and organizations about ways to honor our Veterans. Notwithstanding all the other benefits and services available to our veterans, my answer focuses on veteran jobs.
\
Depending on the research source for veteran unemployment data, the post 9/11 veteran community is facing an unemployment rate ranging from 11.5 percent to 12.4 percent, when the overall national average is 9.1 percent.
\
If you want to know the best way to honor our veterans and the sacrifice they've given for us, include a veterans preferred program when announcing or filling employment opportunities.
\
When you put a veteran to work, you will be hiring someone who has solid problem-solving experience, has proven success as a team member or team leader, and who has protected the well-being of our county, our state and our country.
\
Invest in our veterans.

County finances
\
In his guest column, (Maryland Gazette, Oct. 26) O'Brien Atkinson, president of the Anne Arundel County Fraternal Order of Police, expresses regret at the manner in which the county is managing its fiscal affairs during the current recession.
\
His lament is that the taxpayers are ""winning"" while his membership is ""losing."" Winning and losing is an unfortunate yardstick to use as the county grapples with challenging economic times, just as every county family is doing.
\
The recent headline that the county's largest private employer, Northrop Grumman, is laying off 800 employees should be a reminder to Atkinson as to the severity our country's current economic plight. It is further confirmation of how serious our economic problem is.
\
In this environment, the county has been particularly challenged as it balances the public's desire for services against limited resources, both over the short and long term.
\
County government relies on personnel to deliver its services. Accordingly, the number of employees and their pay and benefits are important variables that can be controlled as the county balances its priorities and budget.
\
The county has made significant adjustments in its operating procedures and practices in order to adjust to the current economic conditions, including reductions and elimination of employee allowances, utilization of furlough days and elimination of vacant positions. These actions and others were taken not in retaliation to our hardworking, loyal county employees, but out of necessity to deal with the current economic and fiscal situation faced by the county.
\
These actions should not be viewed as losses to county employees, but instead as a win, as these actions will allow the county to avoid large scale layoffs of its current workforce as well as deliver promised benefits during their retirement.

Gas tax
\
Gov. O'Malley, do you realize how much damage you will do with a gas tax increase of any size, much less one of 15 cents? John Q. Citizen will not be hit with just the increase in the cost of gas. This tax will also increase the cost of food, clothing, furniture, taking a cab or riding a bus.
\
Sir, are you taking into account the damage you will do to programs like Meals on Wheels and Partners In Care? These volunteer programs depend on volunteers to drive their own vehicles, supplying their own gas to help feed and transport those in need. I for one will not be able to continue to volunteer in these programs.
\
I just cannot afford that extra burden you will be putting on us. Governor, I do not ride in a state-supplied car with state-supplied gas.
\
Voters in Maryland, please consider this in the upcoming elections. It seems those in office at this time are not looking out for you. It is up to us, the voters, to find some men and women who will look out for the citizens of Maryland and say no to a gasoline tax increase.
\
Remember, we already have an increase in tolls. Of course, this will not affect eh little guy, we will not be able to afford the gas to drive anywhere. We will just have to pay the increase in the cost of goods being delivered by those that use the higher cost of fuel.

Redistricting
\
Kudos to Michael Collins (Maryland Gazette, Oct. 22) for stating all the issues that have long been brewing within me regarding irresponsible politicians of Annapolis, especially Michael Busch.
\
I can assure you as nothing else in my life, that Busch has never been, or ever will be, ""my delegate."" He's part of the good ole boys, in Annapolis.
\
And now, the Democrats have figured out a way to gerrymander dividing the districts completely in their favor. Add to that how our governor is going out with gusto in this his last term. He's socking it to us: raising road tolls, raising gasoline tax, and now redistricting in Democrats favor.
\
I recall how in his first term, he called a special session, commandering the legislature, and within several hours they had raised the state sales tax.
\
Kudos to the editor for speaking out about the tons of email from those opposed to redistricting. Is that not telling how the constituents feel? And yet, Busch claims he is ""my delegate."" Hand me a barf bucket.

Congratulations to Mr. Clark for recognizing the entrance of our church in Where is it? (Maryland Gazette, Nov. 2). Many of us were attending a member's funeral at the church Saturday morning and did not get to the paper until later that day.
\
Being very proud of our church history, we would ask that one correction be made. We recently celebrated our 160th not 50th anniversary.
\
John Wesley UMC predates the Civil War and was the result of whites and blacks working together for the betterment of the community. In the very near future we hope to submit to the Gazette a copy of our history for publication.

'Crime and Rent'
\
Re: Ben Weathers and Tim Pratt's ""Crime and Rent"" (Maryland Gazette, Nov. 5).
\
It does not matter what John Grasso says about low income versus crime. Crime is everywhere full stop. Period. We can all be part of a problem and we can all be part of a solution. Anyone who moves into any housing area must help be responsible for looking after themselves, and then others. That also means helping to cut down on crime and finding new ways to do just that.
\
So I say to John Grasso talk of helping and finding solutions because nobody gets anywhere using their energies on negativity. Nobody has time for that.
\
We all need to get off our high horses. I know someone right now who is looking for a low income home as of right now, and not looking for trouble. She is looking for help, assistance, love, care, support, understanding and above all else a place that she can call her own.
\
Give her that and we are putting our best foot forward. Help her and we are all doing our level best.
\
Thank you to Ben and Tim for their story on Crime and Rent.

Recycling and voting
\
County officials are upset (Maryland Gazette, Nov. 5).
\
Its bright yellow recycling containers are showing up in places where they are not supposed to. So now if you want one, you will have to prove that you are a county resident.
\
It is a fiscal issue. These containers cost the county almost $1 million in fiscal 2012. We can now add showing a photo ID in order to obtain a yellow bin.
\
If you want to watch a legislative session from the gallery you must show a photo ID before you can enter the statehouse. If you are checking into a hotel, you have to produce a photo ID. If you are charging a bag of grass seed at Home Depot, you must have a photo ID.
\
But, if you are going to vote in a Maryland election, you merely need to show up and claim to be who you say you are. Does this make any sense? We allow one of our most sacred privileges to be susceptible to fraud and cheating, but we don't dare let someone who doesn't live where he claims purchase a trash can?
\
The arguments used to support not having to show a photo ID in order to vote are hollow and can all be addressed. No citizen should stand for a process that is so important to be left open to potential corruption. We should hold the legislature accountable to correct this situation before the next election.
\
How much do you think elections won by fraud have cost, or have the potential to cost, this state?

"
281," Maryland's 195th General Assembly comes to Annapolis this week amid uncertainty over whether the state's first Republican governor in more than three decades will bring partisan gridlock or a new era of interparty cooperation.\ At one extreme are the pessimists who anticipate 90 days of stalemates, with leaders clashing on how to handle a suffocating budget shortfall and whether slot machines should help fill the gap.\ Those who see a half-full glass - including Gov.-elect Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. - envision a more collegial capital where lawmakers forge bonds while munching on pizza and watching late-night sports shows inside the governor's mansion.\ ""My promise is to return it to the way it used to be,"" said Ehrlich, a former two-term delegate who spent the past eight years in Congress. ""When I was there, we had good debates, and then everybody went out to dinner together. What I observed in Annapolis over the past eight years was a loss of that environment.""\ It's hard to predict which side will prevail, because Maryland state government is undergoing a transformation not seen in generations, while simultaneously coping with grave fiscal challenges.\ ""It's going to be spectacularly interesting,"" said David S. Bliden, executive director of the Maryland Association of Counties. ""There are new leadership teams in the House and the Senate, and a new [executive branch] team on the second floor of an opposite party. It's a new and different dynamic, with a whole cast of players that people haven't seen before.""\ Start with the House of Delegates, which, like the Senate, retains its overwhelming Democratic majority. Nonetheless, 46 of 141 members are new, and incoming House Speaker Michael E. Busch of Anne Arundel County succeeds Casper R. Taylor Jr., whose nine-year tenure was the longest since Colonial days.\ In the past month, Busch has created a committee, shifted one chairman and replaced two others. But even as the new speaker emerges as Ehrlich's staunchest opponent on slots, he is advancing a limited agenda and predicts slow-going on policy.\ ""The first year is always kind of a learning-curve year,"" Busch said. ""The second year is always the most productive for a legislature, and for a governor.""\ On the other side of the State House, 12 of 47 senators are new. Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller retains his post for the 17th consecutive year despite an ethics reprimand during the summer. But through retirements and election defeats, all four committee leaders have been replaced.\ A hopeful Miller said he anticipates a ""very positive"" session ""because we have nowhere to go but up.""\ The General Assembly will open Wednesday at noon with Gov. Parris N. Glendening in his final week in office, but even more change won't be far behind. Ehrlich takes his oath on Jan. 15, and between now and then, an embryonic administration will come to life.\ To date, the Ehrlich regime has been slow to coalesce. The governor has yet to name a budget secretary or appoint Cabinet- level officers to head the departments of transportation, natural resources, environment, and many others.\ ""The Ehrlich team is going to be feeling their way around, looking for help, looking for assistance,"" Miller said.\ Most elected officials agree that debate over balancing the state budget and legalizing slot machines as a revenue source will dominate the 13-week session.\ Legislative analysts foresee a $1.2 billion gap between revenues and expenses in the $22 billion budget that will take effect July 1. Lawmakers are required to pass a balanced budget, so spending cuts and new revenues are needed to fill the chasm.\ ""The budget is going to be the 800-pound gorilla,"" said Del. Alfred W. Redmer Jr., a Perry Hall Republican and House minority leader. ""My perspective is we ought to do nothing more than plug the hole in the dike with as little damage as possible and give the new administration a chance to take a serious looks at the structural deficit.""\ Ehrlich has promised to submit a spending plan that leaves funding for counties and cities intact, avoids layoffs of state workers, and makes no cuts in public safety or education.\ Some lawmakers are skeptical that those goals can be accomplished. ""It's Pollyanna-ish,"" Miller said. ""It's naivete at the worst.""\ To balance the budget, the incoming governor's budget will include between $350 million and $400 million from one-time slot- machine operating license fees, a figure that the General Assembly will find hard to replace if it votes against gambling.\ But some will try. Significantly, Busch has indicated that an administration-sponsored slots bill would stall in his chamber without all 43 Republicans as co-sponsors -unlikely, given some delegates' moral and religious opposition.\ ""I think slots is a very volatile issue, and it's something that needs to be thought out. I don't see how that's an unreasonable request,"" Busch said. He added that lawmakers should consider an unpopular menu of additional revenues prepared recently by a fiscal commission, including several tax increases.\ But departing Republican Del. Donald E. Murphy, chairman of the Baltimore County Republican Central Committee, calls Busch's position ""prefight tough talk"" and ""posturing.""\ ""Nobody wants to talk too tough because they don't want to look like an obstructionist,"" Murphy said. ""Ehrlich won the state. So who are the voters cheering for? Who do they want to win the battle?""\ Ehrlich agreed that his election was, in some respects, a referendum on slots - which he estimates can generate up to $800 million yearly through machines at racetracks. His Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, was opposed to them.\ Ehrlich says a fledgling administration and new General Assembly can still accomplish much. He said he would look to change the state's drug treatment policies and systems for mental health services and juvenile justice - without waiting for the economy to rebound.\ ""We'll have new ideas, and new approaches to old problems,"" he said.\ He also pledged to open Government House to regular meetings with lawmakers and others - but not too early in the day.\ ""Many of you know, I don't operate well in the morning,"" he told a public gathering last week that included several legislators. ""There will be no legislative breakfasts. There will be legislative lunches, and brunches. There will be 1 a.m. SportsCenter pizza.""\ With a Republican installed as governor for the first time since 1967, and GOP lawmakers freshly empowered, other heated debates are expected on issues that include gun control laws, abortion and environmental regulations.\ Ehrlich has said he wants to review some of the state's gun laws for effectiveness. But in the aftermath of the sniper crisis, gun control advocates say they could make progress on initiatives such as ballistic fingerprinting and outlawing the type of weapon suspects Lee Boyd Malvo and John Allen Muhammad are accused of using.\ ""I really don't see any retrenchment,"" said Matt Fenton, president of Marylanders Against Handgun Abuse Inc. ""We really have a good majority in both houses.""\ Daniel M. Clements, chairman of Planned Parenthood of Maryland Inc., is bracing for an assault on abortion rights - through restricted public funding or laws preventing some types of procedures.\ ""The changing composition in the House of Delegates, along with a governor who voted badly in Congress, has us greatly worried,"" he said.\ Many Annapolis veterans are waiting to see which Ehrlich arrives at the State House this month: the partisan congressional player whose voting record was assailed by Democrats during the campaign or the friendly conciliator who served here early in his career.\ ""Sending the signals he has - looking at abortion issues, looking at nutrient runoff - is very concerning and disturbing if you are expecting the Bob Ehrlich we saw in the campaign,"" said Del. Maggie L. McIntosh, the Baltimore Democrat and new leader of the Environmental Matters Committee. ""Those are areas we didn't hear about during the campaign.""\ The Assembly's major issues\ Here are major issues before the General Assembly, which meets for its annual 90-day session beginning Wednesday:\ Budget: Lawmakers will grapple with ways to fill a $550 million hole in the current budget, plus fix a $1.2 shortfall projected in next year's spending plan. To avoid devastating cuts in services, they will discuss a variety of tax increases and other revenues, but Gov.-elect Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. will lobby heavily for slot machines.\ Slots/gambling: Ehrlich says machines at racetracks could yield up to $800 million, a tantalizing prospect. But House Speaker Michael E. Busch is opposed. Expect much discussion on where machines go (racetracks only, or additional venues such as hotels), and who gets the rights to operate and profit from them. Will lawmakers put slots to a referendum to give voters the final say on the issue?\ Health Care: Debate continues on whether the state's insurer-of- last-resort, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, should be sold to a for- profit company. Advocates will try to expand prescription drug coverage and mental health treatment. Busch is pushing lower insurance costs for small businesses and better pay for trauma doctors.\ Death penalty: Legislators will digest a soon-to-be-released study on whether race plays a role in applying the death penalty. Ehrlich will lift Gov. Parris N. Glendening's moratorium on executions, but some - particularly African-American lawmakers - oppose that. Expect a bill to make more crimes punishable by death in response to the fall sniper crisis.\ Abortion: With new Republican prominence, abortion foes will look to restrict public funding for the procedure, among other limits. Ehrlich won't want the issue to dominate his first session, but will he be able to keep it quiet?\ Guns/crime: Ehrlich wants to re-examine some gun laws for effectiveness, while gun opponents say the time is right to expand ballistic fingerprinting and outlaw additional types of guns.\ Transportation: Ehrlich hasn't ruled out a gas tax increase to help pay for transportation projects. The Inter-county Connector, a long-studied highway popular in Montgomery County and advocated by the governor-elect, will receive renewed attention.\ Baltimore City: A bill to change the city's election date - lining it up with gubernatorial election years - will be back. Many will watch how much aid the city gets, and how much help Ehrlich extends to a potential future rival, Mayor Martin O'Malley.\ Environment: Ehrlich will push improvements to sewage treatment plants, which deposit pollutants into the Chesapeake Bay. He will also listen to farmers who want to reconfigure what they call burdensome regulations on waste running off their farms.\ Churches and charter schools: Ehrlich proposes to send more money to ""faith-based"" programs to provide social services, and he also wants legislation encouraging charter schools. Can he get these conservative favorites past the Democrats?\ Credit: SUN STAFF"
282,"Gov. Martin O'Malley took a huge risk this fall, calling leery legislators back to Annapolis to consider a package of tax increases, spending cuts and expanded gambling.\He won big, securing passage of the most ambitious set of legislation a Maryland governor has attempted in years. He and the Democratic leaders of the General Assembly were all smiles yesterday as he signed bills aimed at closing a projected $1.7 billion budget shortfall, expanding health care and establishing the framework of a slots program, should voters legalize it next year.\""It was hard to ask people to do more, but it would have been irresponsible to not ask the people of our state to choose to make progress,"" O'Malley said.\The 44-year-old Democratic governor laid to rest all doubt that he could get his way in Annapolis, but the question that will determine his future might be whether his big win is a pyrrhic victory. Republicans are itching to talk to voters about O'Malley's tax increases, and their former governor, Republican Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., is already using his public platform to criticize his successor.\O'Malley now must hope he can win a second huge bet - that when voters return to the polls in 2010, they will remember his accomplishments and not their lighter pocketbooks.\""The governor worked very hard and risked a lot of political capital,"" said Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, a Southern Maryland Democrat. ""His numbers are going to drop initially, but when people take a harder look ... his numbers will rise again. The state is going to be very well positioned for the next few years.""\Some Democratic politicians have never recovered from criticism of their tax records, but O'Malley aides and others have long pointed to the example of former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner, who campaigned successfully for a huge package of tax increases and spending cuts to fix that state's budget problems. He wound up even more popular than he was before.\Republicans are betting the reaction to O'Malley's plan will be quite different.\""The governor claims a short-term political victory, but I think when he starts going outside State Circle there is going to be an awful lot of negative feedback toward him,"" said Senate Minority Leader David Brinkley, a Frederick County Republican.\Indeed, it would be difficult to tag anyone else with the credit or the blame for the results of the special legislative session that ended early yesterday morning.\O'Malley developed the plan himself in consultation with top advisers, took it to state residents and called the special session without being certain that lawmakers would pass his proposals.\Miller and House Speaker Michael E. Busch, an Anne Arundel County Democrat, were crucial in rounding up the votes in their chambers. But O'Malley lobbied extensively behind the scenes.\""He could have failed and failed greatly,"" said Miller, who characterized the governor's plan as the most ambitious agenda he has seen in a career that spans seven governors. ""Instead, he achieved and achieved greatly.""\But whether voters will see it that way is another question.\O'Malley said yesterday that action was necessary to maintain Maryland's quality of life and that he tried to cushion the impact on working families.\That doesn't mean people are happy about it. Legislators say they got thousands of calls and e-mails from constituents - some of them quite nasty - complaining about the tax increases and promising electoral retribution.\""Right now there is a significant part of the population that is upset just with taxes in general and second with what seems to be a very awkward process to get to that conclusion,"" said Greater Baltimore Committee President and Chief Executive Officer Donald C. Fry, a former Democratic legislator from Harford County.\""But the elections are three years off, and the governor and legislators will have a chance to show what they've done.""\Del. Christopher B. Shank, the minority whip from Western Maryland, said Republicans will be reminding voters of the tax increases up until the 2010 election. He said it's hard to know whether they will still be a potent issue then - the answer, he said, will depend on the state of the economy, the national political mood and a dozen other factors.\But the constitutional amendment proposal to authorize slot machine gambling on the November 2008 ballot will provide an early test for O'Malley, Shank said.\""Particularly inside the Democratic Party, all sorts of consternation is bubbling to the surface as a result of this,"" he said. ""Clearly, Comptroller [Peter] Franchot is going to be involved in the process, and who knows what role Governor Ehrlich will play.""\Indeed, O'Malley could find himself buffeted from both ends of the political spectrum. Ehrlich did not directly criticize O'Malley in an appearance on WMAR-TV last night. But he said Democrats did nothing but tax and spend in this special session and are not likely to stop.\""If you are a service provider in the state of Maryland, look out, because now they have breached that wall,"" Ehrlich said, referring to the extension of the sales tax to computer services.\Franchot, a Democrat, said yesterday that he will be active in the ""David-versus-Goliath"" battle over slot machines, which he opposes.\Though he and O'Malley are from the same party, Franchot remains sharply critical of the special session.\""I've traveled all over the state in the last three weeks, and it's just a universal opinion from Republicans and Democrats that the process of the special session was deeply flawed,"" Franchot said, pointing to the inclusion of the tax on computer services without a full public hearing.\But on the day after the special session, O'Malley still had standing by his side the same coalition of supporters who helped him win in 2006.\Despite cuts to education funding, Maryland State Teachers Association President Clara Floyd issued a statement yesterday afternoon praising O'Malley for his efforts to pass a ""comprehensive and fair revenue package.""\Although O'Malley pushed for a sales tax increase and legalizing slot machine gambling, two revenue sources opposed by many in the political left, Progressive Maryland Director Sean Dobson proclaimed the session ""a double win for blue-collar families, offering more effective public services and fairer taxes as well."" He praised, for example, the $800 increase in the individual exemption for taxpayers earning up to $150,000 a year.\Baltimore County Executive James T. Smith Jr., whose aid in 2006 was crucial to O'Malley's victory, said people will recognize that the combination of cuts and new revenues the governor proposed and the legislature passed were the responsible thing to do.\""This is a pretty balanced approach to a serious problem,"" Smith said. ""When the dust settles and the results can be framed in an understandable way, that's going to be recognized by the public.""\andy.green@baltsun.com\Sun reporter James Drew contributed to this article.\KEY SPECIAL SESSION ACTION\SLOTS\WHAT GOV. O'MALLEY PROPOSED Proposed a November 2008 referendum on a constitutional amendment to allow up to 15,000 machines at five locations - one each in Anne Arundel, Allegany, Cecil and Worcester counties and in Baltimore City.\WHAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED\Slightly increased the take for slots operators from 30 percent to 33 percent but otherwise passed the governor's proposal largely intact.\INCOME TAX\WHAT GOV. O'MALLEY PROPOSED\Proposed new brackets that would have resulted in savings for individuals with taxable incomes under $157,000 and couples with taxable incomes under $214,000. He proposed a new 6 percent bracket for income greater than $150,000 for individuals and $200,000 for couples, and a 6.5 percent bracket for all income over $500,000 a year. Currently, all taxpayers qualify for the top bracket of 4.75 percent, which applies to all taxable income over $3,000.\WHAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED\Left the rate at 4.75 percent for individuals making less than $150,000 a year and couples making less than $200,000. The rate will increase to 5 percent on taxable income above $150,000 a year for individuals and $200,000 for couples; 5.25 percent on taxable income greater than $300,000 a year for individuals, and $350,000 a year for couples; and 5.5 percent for all income above $500,000 a year. Also, the individual exemption for taxpayers earning up to $150,000 a year would increase to $800. Others would receive the current exemption of $2,400 or less.\SALES TAX\WHAT GOV.

O'MALLEY PROPOSED\Proposed increasing the rate from 7 percent to 8 percent and splitting the proceeds between transportation and higher education. He pushed for ""combined reporting,"" a tax law change that proponents say would prevent corporations from hiding profits in other states but which business groups say is onerous to administer. O'Malley also proposed closing a tax loophole in which companies were able to sell real estate without paying the transfer tax.\WHAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED\Increased the rate to 8.25 percent and split the proceeds between the general fund and higher education. Approved a bill to study ""combined reporting"" and other alternative methods of calculating corporate taxes. Adopted the transfer tax loophole-closing measure.\TOBACCO TAX\WHAT GOV. O'MALLEY PROPOSED\Proposed doubling the tax to $2 a pack.\WHAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED\Approved the increase.\PROPERTY TAX\WHAT GOV.

The gas tax proposal failed.\SPENDING CUTS\WHAT GOV. O'MALLEY PROPOSED\Proposed a slowdown in annual education spending increases and a few other cuts totaling $343 million in the next fiscal year. He had already cut $200 million from the budget.\WHAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED\Directed O'Malley to cut a total of $550 million from next year's projected spending but left up to him how to arrive at that figure.\Credit: SUN REPORTER"
283," Annapolis is awash in good feelings as the General Assembly prepares to convene this week, with lawmakers saying they are eager for a respite from the intense partisanship that has dominated the state Capitol recently.\ But it's easy to envision the honeymoon ending soon.\ Despite the losses by Republicans and the inauguration next week of a Democratic governor, the potential for fierce debate remains as the state grapples over the next four years with billion-dollar budget shortfalls and growing pressure to expand health care access. Decisions on social issues such as the death penalty and gay marriage could determine whether Maryland sheds its conservative Democratic past and fully joins the ranks of the nation's most liberal states.\ New legislators and new governors typically take some time to feel their way, and many expect this year will be no different.\ Nearly a quarter of the seats in each chamber of the General Assembly turned over after last year's election, and the newcomers need time to find their offices, much less affect legislation.\ Gov.-elect Martin O'Malley has yet to take positions on several of the issues that could spark the most contention, such as a smoking ban in bars and restaurants. But at the same time, he has worked with some success to build a reservoir of goodwill after the tumult of Republican Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.'s term.\ Ehrlich was unable to get many of his priorities through the legislature and saw dozens of his vetoes overridden in the past two years - moves he took as a personal insult. O'Malley has huddled with top legislators and county government leaders since winning election, assuring them that they will be partners in his administration. He has even made courtesy calls to GOP leaders, impressing those such as House Minority Leader Anthony J. O'Donnell of Southern Maryland.\ ""Governor O'Malley has come into office, and he's got a lot of political capital,"" Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller said. ""There's a sense of euphoria, even among Republicans, that there's this lack of tension. There's a sense that we can get things done.""\ Even so, the traditional inclination of lawmakers to put off major issues until the second year of a term appears stronger than usual because of a growing consensus among the Democrats who lead the General Assembly that Maryland should conduct a major overhaul of its tax structure.\ No major tax changes have been enacted since the 1960s, and several key lawmakers say they want the system to better reflect the current economy, and generate more revenue for education, health care, transportation and other government programs.\ Miller and House Speaker Michael E. Busch have said they support a tax overhaul. Miller has said he thinks changes could be made this year, but most leaders expect the creation of a study commission with an attempt at changes in 2008.\ O'Malley has pledged not to seek revenue increases this year but has said he wants a comprehensive solution to a state fiscal structure that has oscillated between boom and bust for years.\ A restructuring would involve raising some taxes and cutting others, but the net result would almost certainly be that the state collects more from its residents. One often-discussed idea involves expanding the list of services to which the sales tax is applied, a nod to the state's shift away from a manufacturing-based economy.\ The tax reform idea has even gained some currency among traditional tax foes.\ ""The economy has changed. We recognize it,"" said Maryland Chamber of Commerce President Kathleen T. Snyder. ""We would like to see such a study group comprised of tax experts, economists ... not just people saying, `Oh, we've got a $1 billion hole, here's $1 billion in taxes we can raise.'""\ O'Malley made a number of potentially expensive promises during the campaign, and he has pointed to looming shortfalls and the need to close them to tamp down expectations for how quickly those pledges will be fulfilled.\ This week, for example, he said he still intends to fund a program to give more aid to jurisdictions where the costs of education are greater but said it likely won't happen this year.\ ""How soon we'll be able to do that is still an open question,"" he said.\ Liberal advocacy groups and business groups alike are pushing this year for a major expansion of health insurance coverage, but that issue, too, could become subsumed by tax reform.\ A large coalition is pushing for a $1-a-pack increase in the cigarette tax to fund the expansion of Medicaid, drug treatment and other health programs. Nearly half of the legislature - including a number of influential lawmakers - is backing the proposal, which also got the endorsement this week of the Greater Baltimore Committee, a business group.\ The Chamber of Commerce opposes the cigarette tax increase, but it is endorsing a plan to require high-income people to purchase health insurance, a cause that liberal groups also back. O'Malley has pledged to help small businesses band together to buy health insurance for their employees, another Chamber priority, and some key legislators are looking to Massachusetts, which enacted near- universal health care last year, for ideas.\ ""2007 is clearly going to be the year of health care,"" said Vincent DeMarco, president of the Maryland Citizens Health Initiative, which is pushing the tobacco tax.\ But again, it may well take much more than this year's 90-day legislative session to do the job. Busch said his goal is to cut the number of uninsured Marylanders in half by the end of the four-year term, but he said he expects only incremental steps this year. Many of the major pieces to health care reform will require new revenues, and that will likely have to wait for a tax reform package, he said.\ Even slot machine gambling, a perennial issue in Annapolis, may become attached to a tax package in the second General Assembly session of the term. O'Malley's chief policy adviser, Joseph Bryce, said last week that slots need to be considered in a broader context. Busch, who has been the biggest obstacle to slots for the past four years, said much the same thing.\ ""If you're going to try to balance the structural budget on a long-term basis, you need to come up with a stable revenue source as well,"" he said.\ Some issues that come without a major price tag for the state could become a big part of this session. Environmentalists say they will push for new pollution restrictions on cars and stricter standards to prevent pollution from entering the Chesapeake Bay. Republican leaders say they will push for tougher sentences for sex offenders and protections against government seizure of property.\ But the issues that could turn the spirit of cooperation into a philosophical battle are those that would determine whether Maryland swings further left of center. This session could see fights over whether the state should abolish the death penalty, allow gay marriage, and ban smoking in bars and restaurants.\ Although Maryland has been run by Democrats more or less continuously for decades, moderates and conservatives have long held sway, keeping the state from the liberal forefront on some social and fiscal issues.\ But in the last election, the legislature got an influx of forceful, articulate liberal members, mainly from the Washington suburbs. The Senate, in particular, could feel the effects as conservatives who were key swing votes on issues such as gun control were replaced by liberals.\ Blair Lee IV, a developer and conservative political columnist from Montgomery County, said the center has collapsed in Maryland politics in recent years. The political left has grown as a result, but the right largely has not, he said.\ ""Four years from now it's going to be a much different state,"" Lee said. ""We're clearly going to be more regulated. We're going to have higher taxes. We could be a single-payer health care state. We may be a no death penalty state. We might be a gay marriage state. We might be a California car emissions state. ... The next Massachusetts? Yeah, looks like it. What's to stop it?""\ Republicans, although they are outnumbered 2-1 in both chambers, say they'll try. With the loss of the governor's mansion, the GOP has been working to retrench and figure out an approach to maintain its relevance in Annapolis. The new leaders the party has selected say they want to stand on principle and hope to attract the remaining conservative Democrats.\ ""I'd offer a word of caution to not misinterpret what was a nationalized election as a mandate for an extreme left-wing lurch,"" said O'Donnell, the new House minority leader.\ What will ultimately set the course, said Sen. Paul G. Pinsky, a Prince George's County Democrat, is the agenda O'Malley pushes. ""You have a number of liberals and progressives and moderates, but I think it's at the tipping point,"" Pinsky said. ""The power of the governor and his agenda can push something over the top and give it the momentum it needs to get life.""\ Where O'Malley stands on some of these issues is known - he opposes the death penalty and has not lent support to gay marriage, for example - but for the moment, he's talking much more about his eagerness to compromise than about where he will spend his political capital.\ His agenda remains vague, and until he spells it out, much of the character of this session and the three that will follow it will remain impossible to know.\ ""That'll all come,"" O'Malley said. ""Over the course of the campaign, we were really clear in laying out a comprehensive and ambitious agenda. Now is the process of governing and figuring out how quickly and how much progress we can make over the next four years.""\ andy.green@baltsun.com\ Other key legislative issues\ Budget/taxes The scheduling quirks of Maryland's Constitution give Gov.-elect Martin O'Malley a scant two days after he is inaugurated Jan. 17 before he must submit a budget for fiscal 2008, which starts in July. He has a relatively modest gap to fill through spending cuts or new revenues for 2008, but after that, analysts expect shortfalls of $1 billion or more a year. O'Malley has offered few hints on how he intends to deal with the problem, but Democratic leaders in the General Assembly say they want a comprehensive overhaul of the state's tax structure, maybe this year.\ Death penalty A recent Court of Appeals decision put Maryland's death penalty on hold unless the legislature adopts regulations for how lethal injections are carried out. With the election of several more liberals to the state Senate, it could be difficult for such a measure to overcome a filibuster. O'Malley personally opposes the death penalty.\ Environment Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller pledged last week that his chamber would pass a bill allowing Maryland to join 11 other states in requiring tailpipe emissions standards for cars that are stricter than the levels established by the federal government. The initiative would regulate carbon dioxide emissions, which are not part of the federal standards, and would require a minimum percentage of cars sold in the state to use advanced emissions control technology, a standard that would encourage the sale of hybrids. Environmentalists are also pushing for more funding to preserve open space, and tougher regulations on storm-water runoff flowing into the Chesapeake Bay.\ Gay marriage The Court of Appeals is considering whether to uphold a Circuit Court ruling that paved the way for gay marriage. If it does, social conservatives in the House and Senate are poised to push for a constitutional amendment to ban the unions, but it could be difficult for them to achieve the required three-fifths majorities needed in both chambers to put such a measure on the ballot. This is an issue that a lot of Democrats wish would just go away.\ Ground rent Legislative leaders say they want to phase out the state's ground-rent system - arcane laws that in Baltimore have led to residents losing their homes for unpaid bills of a few hundred dollars. Lawmakers and the incoming administration say they will make reform a priority, prompted by a series of articles in The Sun that documented abuses. Ideas include eliminating the system and a prohibition on the seizure of homes.\ Growth/housing The good news is that Maryland was a big winner in a national military base realignment and will get tens of thousands of high-paying jobs in the next few years. The bad news is that all those people will need someplace to live, and that could be a tough challenge, as residents of many communities are tired of growth and many jurisdictions are finding their available land dwindling.\ Slot machines Prospects look dicey for the state to act on an issue that tied Annapolis in knots for the past four years. O'Malley is lukewarm about legalizing slot machines, saying that he would support them to help the horse racing industry but that he is unlikely to press the issue. Miller, the biggest slots backer in the Assembly, still wants them but has said he will wait for the governor to take the initiative. Meanwhile, House Speaker Michael E. Busch, his position solidified by re-election, remains steadfastly opposed. That said, somebody is bound to introduce a slots bill, and many expect a push to package legalized gambling with a tax reform package sometime in the next four years.\ Smoking A large coalition - with the pledged support of nearly half the legislature - is pushing to raise the tobacco tax by $1 a pack on cigarettes to pay for expanding Medicaid eligibility. Additionally, momentum is building for a statewide smoking ban in bars and restaurants. Baltimore is considering a local restriction (Howard, Montgomery and other counties have a ban), which, if passed, could be the tipping point for a measure that has failed for several years.\ Transportation The gridlock-bound Washington suburbs flexed their electoral muscle this year, and some leaders in the region are pushing for a gas tax increase to pay for more roads and mass transit. A lot of the state's debt capacity is being used up by the funding for the Inter-County Connector, and O'Malley may find himself in need of new revenues (such as a gas tax increase) to pay for the roads and rails he wants.\ Key Dates\ Wednesday:\ Assembly opens.\ Jan. 17:\ Gov.-elect Martin O'Malley inaugurated.\ Jan. 19:\ Deadline for governor to submit state budget bill.\ Feb. 16:\ ""Green Bag,"" containing appointments to boards made by governor, submitted to legislature.\ March 5:\ Final day for submitting legislation without suspension of rules.\ March 26:\ Crossover Day, deadline for each chamber passing bills it intends to send to opposite chamber.\ April 2:\ Deadline for both chambers' passage of budget bill.\ April 9:\ Adjournment ""sine die.""\ Credit: Sun Reporter"

287,"
My name is Tim Walters, and I am running for state delegate in District 32 to provide voters a real choice this November from the long one-party rule.
\
Such one-sidedness has created a stagnant economy, 80 new taxes, poor job opportunity and unaccountable spending. In other words, a state government that no longer listens to its citizens.
\
In District 32, too many citizens are thinking about moving as soon as they can. Job creation is nonexistent. Marylanders are suffering under an unbelievable $10 billion per year spending increase over just eight years ago. No one knows where the money is going. One-party rule creates an environment of poor accountability.
\
Under one-party rule, we have been promised that casino money would increase education funding amounts. Under one-party rule, we have been promised a ""lock box"" for transportation funding, but that lock box was opened up for general spending years ago. Now, they added the gas tax. Where will that money go? That money is already earmarked for general spending, not for roads.
\
Under one-party rule, we were promised that more and more dollars for education would help our children. Well, it depends on whose children they are talking about. Did you know that the state education formula for allocation of our money takes our Anne Arundel County dollars and sends them to other jurisdictions? I will work tirelessly to make the state funding formula fairer for Anne Arundel County.
\
Then we have the stormwater fee. Property owners and businesses are paying additional fees to meet the new federal environmental standards. That is after raiding the bay fund of $250 million to balance the budget, and the Chesapeake Bay is still rated an F.
\
While I love Maryland and the bay as much as you do, it is unconscionable that no one in the ruling party allows for any adjustment, even small, in existing programs to save our taxpayer dollars. Why is this so hard? You and I do this with our household budgets. But in Maryland, one party rule has only the ""more tax"" solution.
\
Here's the kicker! A Vehicle Mileage Tax is quietly under consideration. They don't get enough taxes from taxing the rain, gas, our properties and increasing tolls. They want to tax us on the number of miles we drive. Together, we can stop that kind of thinking once and for all.
\
Right now, we must peel back taxes to create a more prosperous environment, thereby improving overall tax revenues. Ronald Reagan proved this simple theory that if you tax something more, you get less of it. Maryland Comptroller Democrat Peter Franchot agrees and has stated more taxes are not the answer. In Maryland, we are seeing people move away and job creation is stagnant.
\
In my current job, one of my principal duties is to manage how money is spent. I promise to make spending our tax dollars accountable to you, the taxpayer. If I am elected to the House of Delegates, I will turn over every rock to see how your money and mine is being spent, before I will even think of voting for another tax raise.
\
I am a longtime resident of Maryland. I retired from the Navy in 2005 as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal technician. I live and work in District 32. My wife and I will celebrate 29 years of marriage this year. My grandchildren are fifth-generation Linthicum residents.
\
The point? In Tim Walters, you have someone who loves Maryland and wants to see you stay here, too. Together, we can end one party rule which is nothing but increased and more taxes. If you think we can do better, please vote for Tim Walters.

288,"In the last eight years, Gov. Martin O'Malley and the state legislature have increased spending by almost $10 billion dollars, or about $7,000 per year for the average Maryland family. Much of this spending goes to a bloated state infrastructure, entitlement programs and the costs associated with illegal immigration. Where this money is not going to is the Lower Shore.\As your next state delegate, I will fight against increased spending and taxes. I will support measures to improve the regulatory environment for our job creators. We can improve our economic output, resolve our unemployment crisis and move toward a more balanced fiscal situation on the Lower Shore by focusing on policies that create jobs and do not take jobs away from our communities.\Chris Adams\adams7614@gmail.com\Rene Desmarais\Improvement in employment opportunity is the biggest need of the Lower Shore. To address this, we should:\Decrease rules, regulations and taxes for businesses. No single solution will help attract and keep businesses in the state. However, lowering the tax burden for businesses would help. Our state business tax climate is 41st in the nation, according to the Tax Foundation.\Lower health care insurance costs for businesses. Every business, regardless of size, should be given the opportunity to self-insure. Of course, this would require the creation of a new entity that would pool health risk for multiple businesses. Successful models for this already exist that have led to decreases in costs of 30 percent or more. Further, these systems also promote a healthy workforce by expanding disease prevention. For this to have the best chance of success, we must build a better health care system on the Lower Shore, so we will have the highest quality care at the lowest cost.\Foster the use of lean methodologies by businesses, allowing them to decrease waste and improve value. We can start by offering workshops in these methods for businesses unfamiliar with them.\Help businesses secure grants and low-interest loans for both existing and new businesses.\Enhance the use of micro loans to help business startups.\Rene Desmarais\www.renedesmarais.com\Johnny Mautz\The most important issue facing the Lower Shore is our economy. Taxes, fees and regulations are choking small businesses, which include watermen and farmers. The Lower Shore's economy depends on small businesses, and I will work to create an environment where our small businesses can survive and grow by cutting taxes, fees and preventing new regulations that hurt small business.\Johnny Mautz\www.johnnymautz.com\Allen Nelson\Much of the Lower Shore has not fully emerged from the economic downturn, while other parts of the state have shown significant improvement. During this time, Maryland has enacted about 80 increases in taxes and fees, along with an untold number of cumbersome regulations during the last eight years. Several of these specifically have more harshly impacted the Eastern Shore. Sales tax and gas tax increases are two examples. To make matters worse, they have pushed responsibility for previous state payments down to the counties, while taking away such sources of funding as the highway user funds.\My interest is to be elected and to help other like-minded candidates get elected who have clearly identified a reduction in taxes as a major priority. Regardless of that outcome, it is my intention to work toward reducing taxes on our residents. The sales tax increase further drives business from Maryland shops across the border to Delaware.\Allen Nelson\www.allennelsonfordelegate.com\Karen Tolley\I believe one of the biggest needs for the Lower Shore is economic prosperity. As a certified public accountant, I believe in the ""hand-up"" approach, as opposed to the hand out. My goal for the Eastern Shore is to obtain, promote and provide the tools necessary for every family to thrive.\My platform concentration is fiscal responsibility, educational enrichment, public health and safety, citizen services and partnerships.\Karen Tolley\www.karentolley.com"
289,"As Gov. Martin O'Malley makes his final State of the State speech today, it's a good time to look at what seven years of his governorship have meant for Maryland.\The state of the state is clearly good: first in median family income, a top-three state in income mobility, first in K-12 education five years in a row. And Maryland has already recovered 99 percent of jobs lost in the Great Recession. These are hard facts. \But such snapshots overstate and understate Mr. O'Malley's impact. They reflect decades of state policy, external events, technological and demographic changes -- and plain old luck. \Governors do make a difference, though, particularly ones with strong values and strong leadership skills. \For example, in January 2006, after three years of Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.'s budget cuts had forced college tuition up 43 percent, I proposed that the University System of Maryland Board of Regents (of which I was then a member) freeze tuition for the coming year. My proposal was defeated 13-to-1. But that week, Martin O'Malley took up the cause of college affordability, won the governor's race, froze tuition for four years and has capped tuition hikes at 3 percent for the past three years. \The result is Mr. O'Malley has led Maryland to best in the nation in boosting college affordability, from the sixth-highest tuition to the middle of pack. That's change Maryland families can take to the bank. \It's also a great example of the values and governing style Mr. O'Malley has brought to Annapolis. \He took office after four years of partisan and social division, fiscal gridlock and underinvestment. \In 2007, Mr. O'Malley moved decisively to get the state back on track. He called a special General Assembly session to clean up the billion-dollar long-term deficit he inherited, raising revenue by making the income tax more progressive and closing tax loopholes. And he took on more controversial issues -- cutting the budget, adding a penny to the sales tax and negotiating a compromise on gambling. The result? Maryland's AAA bond rating was reaffirmed, and the state was fiscally prepared to weather the international financial crisis of 2008. \He also brought a new tone to Annapolis: respect for political opponents, immigrants and other minorities -- and even legislators. When I came to the Senate in 2007, I was astonished to hear Republican colleagues say they were being consulted more by Mr. O'Malley than they had been by his predecessor. \In government, as in kindergarten, playing well with others is mission critical. Mr. O'Malley has shown he's an A student in working with diverse personalities and interests. More than anything else, that's why he's been able to strengthen Maryland's finances, expand health insurance to over 450,000 Marylanders, make college more affordable, boost renewable energy by 40 percent -- not to mention win re-election by 14 points in 2010, a strong Republican year. \Mr. O'Malley has won almost his whole agenda -- including repealing the death penalty, reducing gun violence and other crime and boosting minority contracting -- by listening and leading. He has strong values -- social solidarity, social justice and economic opportunity -- and strong leadership. But he understands that compromise is the secret sauce of democracy. \Time and again, he has taken on controversial issues -- fiscal prudence, immigrant and gay rights and environment protection. While other states ignored underfunded pensions, Mr. O'Malley worked with state unions to strengthen Maryland's. \For years he joined business leaders pushing to reduce traffic congestion. He knew raising the gas tax would never be popular. But when some Democrats wanted to him to dodge the issue until his term ended, he said no. He worked with legislators from around the state to pass a $2.9 billion package of investment in transit and roads. \Then there's health care. \Even with the Maryland Health Exchange's website problems, 453,000 more Marylanders have gained health insurance since 2007. With recent approval of the updated ""Medicare waiver,"" Maryland leads the nation in innovation to hold down health care costs. And when he saw problems with the website, Governor O'Malley moved aside the bureaucrat who mismanaged it, put in a new team and told them to fix it. Now, more than 12,000 Marylanders a week are signing up for a health care plan. \When Governor O'Malley took office in 2007, Maryland's long-term finances were out of balance. The next year the Great Recession hit the state. He managed through the tough times, cleaned up the fiscal mess he inherited and launched a wave of reform and investment -- from transportation and health to education and the environment -- to grow Maryland's middle class for decades to come. \Sen.

290,"Make expanding pre-K a priority in Maryland\Many thanks for The Sun's long-standing, enthusiastic support for expanding pre-K in Maryland (""The agenda for 2014,"" Jan. 8). \We especially appreciate The Sun's assessment that expanded access will help give our children a competitive edge and narrow the achievement gap. I would like to help address The Sun's concern about finding ""a realistic way to pay for it."" \One thing children practice in pre-K is creative thinking skills, and the early-childhood education field has done a little creative thinking of its own. By offering pre-K not only in school but also in existing high-quality settings like accredited child care centers, Maryland can greatly reduce startup costs of pre-K expansion, including capital and professional development. \This ""diverse delivery"" system gives parents greater choice and, especially for children of working parents, means fewer disruptions for adults and children during the day. \In the long term, quality pre-K pays for itself. Those who attend pre-K have greater employment and higher wages as adults than children who do not have a quality education experience as 4-year-olds. Combine this with other benefits, such as reduced crime and more stable families, and you have an initiative that works for everyone. \In the short term, as with most policy proposals, the funding details are worked out in budget deliberations. Ultimately, Maryland Family Network hopes to see pre-K financing incorporated into the pending re-evaluation of the Thornton Act education funding formula. \The question should not be how we pay for the expansion of pre-K in Maryland but rather how we'll pay if we don't. \Margaret E. Williams, Baltimore \The writer is executive director of the Maryland Family Network. \Dwyer gets off easy \Del. Don Dwyer has been denied a committee seat? Oh my, such a harsh punishment (""Twice-convicted Dwyer is denied a seat on any House committee,"" Jan. 10)! \House Speaker Michael E. Busch said the move was ""to protect the integrity of the House of Delegates."" Any staffer guilty of two drunken driving offenses would probably be out of a job in a flash and denied unemployment compensation to boot. \I have news for the Maryland House of Delegates: There isn't much ""integrity"" left. After ""theft"" of funds targeted for transportation improvements and making it up with a gas tax, gerrymandering legislative districts, running deficit after deficit, and a host of other despicable and partisan actions, just what ""integrity"" does Mr. Busch think remains? \What we, the citizens of Maryland, need and want is more accountability and more integrity. \Warren Updike, Towson \Want to be tough on crime? Legalize marijuana \If Gov. Martin O'Malley is so tough on crime, he should end the prohibition on cannabis (marijuana) today (""Mike Miller, marijuana and the right side of history,"" Jan. 9), \Cannabis prohibition produces underground markets, cartels, increased hard-drug addiction rates, and contempt for drug laws. \It also leads to eroded constitutional rights, loss of freedom, escalating prison populations, corrupt politicians, racial discrimination and trillions of dollars in wasted taxes, all of which are crimes. \Stan White, Dillon, Colo. \Little steps can help our environment \With so many people interested in eating locally, buying locally, and creating a more sustainable environment, your recent article was very timely (""Resolve to add native plants in 2014,"" Jan. 9). \The insights may be ideas many have heard before, but the reminder to focus on buying what is native, grows well in this zone and promises maximum benefit to the insects and animals that delight our days could not have come at a better time. \We need more of these local writings helping guide our garden planning and buying patterns and pointing to the ways each of us affects quality-of-life issues. Providing some water, planting shrubs and trees that bear fruit, and creating dense shrubs to protect birds on frigid winter days is not that hard to do; planting more appropriately seems the best way to create wildlife sanctuaries in our own backyards. \I plan to share this with my neighbors and encourage more of them to think before they plant and to take the next step of making their yards a certified wildlife habitat through the National Wildlife Federation. These certified backyards provide the four basic habitat elements needed for wildlife to thrive: food, water, cover and places to raise young. \Planting right is integral to these goals. As I've watched stately tall oaks in my neighborhood be pulled down to make way for oversized houses, I know what I have do to. Please let's see more of these reminders of little steps that make a big difference in our yards, our communities and our region. \Anita Nowery Durel, Baltimore\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
291,"Hundreds of Harford County's mass transit riders say they are conserving energy and helping to preserve the environment without adding to congestion on Interstate 95. Riding the bus also saves them money on gas and parking in downtown Baltimore.\Now they are battling the Maryland Transit Administration's cost-savings proposals that would eliminate one of the four commuter bus lines from the county to Baltimore and cut back trips on others. A public hearing in Bel Air last week drew nearly 150 people. More than 40 of them argued that increased ridership alone is reason to keep the service.\""We have ridership here, and they want to cut it,"" said Maddy Thomann of Bel Air. ""They should be adding lines, and even more people will use it. This is the only transportation many people have to their jobs. The cuts make no sense.""\The audience included government and hospital employees, university students and disabled residents, a few of them veterans, for whom driving is not an option. Some said they bought homes near public transportation and many said they have become accustomed to the ease of a bus ride into the city. Lisa Calvert Chalk of Bel Air said MTA has taken a hatchet to its schedules when it should have used a scalpel.\""We have chosen safe, reliable transportation and you are asking us to trade that in,"" said Phyllis Wilcox, who commutes to Johns Hopkins Hospital.\With a show of hands, nearly all in the audience said they would be willing to pay higher fares to keep buses rolling, an option the governor opposes.\""I think a fare increase is reasonable but the elimination of an entire route, which consists of four or five daily round trips, or cutting back on daily runs would be detrimental to the Harford County commuters,"" said Marge Sears of Bel Air, who has taken the bus to her job at a Baltimore law firm for nearly 20 years.\MTA has not raised fares, which account for 40 percent of its operating costs, in five years. An increase would not generate sufficient income and would be unfair to riders not affected by service reductions, officials said.\If the 412 line from Forest Hill to Baltimore is discontinued, many at the hearing said there will be no stops at the University of Maryland or Veterans Administration hospitals.\""Keep this service,"" said Maxine Bowers of Forest Hill, who has been riding the 412 downtown for nearly five years. ""You are serving working people every day, people who are paying taxes.""\Ridership has increased steadily on the Harford lines, particularly in the past few years, including a nearly 30 percent jump this summer, said Reginald Durbin, a driver for Dillon Bus Service, MTA's local contractor. Steve Duker of Fallston called the four Harford lines ""shining jewels in the system. You can set your watch by them.""\MTA, which is funded through motor vehicle fees and gas taxes, is operating with declining revenues and rising costs. The agency could lose $2.5 billion in revenues over the next six years, officials said. It must trim its budget by eliminating bus and MARC train lines and decreasing the number of trips on other routes.\""It is the perfect storm that nobody foresaw,"" said John Hovatter, MTA's director of marketing and commuter service. ""Operating costs are sky-high and revenues are just so low.""\Raise fares or cut overlapping routes in the city, but leave lines that are working for Harford alone, speakers reiterated.\""I thought the idea was to work with the riders,"" Sears said.\Rafael Guroian, a member of the MARC riders advisory committee, said the cuts place an undue burden on those in the counties. He urged MTA officials to seek other sources of funding.\""Your budget depends on the gas tax and vehicle registration,"" he said. ""The very things mass transit users are battling against are taking down our service.""\Republican Del. Susan K. McComas, leader of Harford's legislative delegation, said she will work with MTA on a resolution.\""The governor has made the political decision to cancel the 412 instead of considering an increase in fare box recovery,"" McComas said. ""Commuters have been encouraged by the state to use public transportation to help the environment, conserve resources, save money and alleviate congested highways. Now many are scrambling to find other sources of transportation in very difficult financial times. To cancel the 412 is not moving Maryland forward, and it hurts working families.""\MTA officials are conducting 18 public hearings at locations in the metropolitan area to gather information from commuters. Hearings are set for 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Edgewood Recreation Center, 1980 Brookside Drive, Edgewood, and from 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. the same day at Perryville High School, 1696 Perryville Road.\""This is the democratic process at work,"" Hovatter said. ""Comments will be sorted and recorded, then discussed with the administration before making recommendations to the secretary of transportation.""\County Councilman James V. McMahan, who serves the Bel Air area, said he has heard complaints from many constituents who ""would be in dire straits, if they take public transit away.\""Ten years ago, MTA was clamoring for riders,"" McMahan said.

Their number was diminished last week with the death on Nov. 21 of Andrew ""Andy"" Tartaglino.\Andy's investigative roots were in the old federal Bureau of Narcotics. I first worked with him in the late 60s when I was U.S. Attorney for Maryland. His job in those days was to ferret out corruption among our own narcotics agents. It was tough work and, in the violent world of drug dealers, very dangerous. Andy's staff revered him. But he had his enemies: agents whose misconduct he investigated and complacent colleagues who wouldn't face the ugly facts he uncovered. Andy had no tolerance for the fabled ""code of silence."" To Andy, a ""dirty"" agent belonged in prison.\There were some who called him ruthless. ""Relentless"" would be more accurate. Andy scrupulously abided by the laws and regulations that applied to his difficult trade. But he was clever and creative. And he could be tricky. He relished outsmarting the bad buys. Guile in the service of good was Andy's modus operandi.\Andy and I reconnected years later in the Maryland Attorney General's Office. He was the driving force behind the efforts of our Medicaid fraud unit to catch health care providers who cheated the public. He put together the state's first prosecutions of doctors who billed Medicaid for phantom visits, dentists who ""filled"" teeth that had been extracted years earlier and nursing home operators who put private yachts, baby sitters and personal landscaping on the taxpayers tab.\Respect for law, contempt for corruption and devotion to duty were surely part of what made Andy tick. But somewhere near the core of this remarkable man was another, more intimate, quality -- his respect and affection for his comrades in arms, the men and women with whom he shared his zeal for the chase and its risks.\I was privileged along with many others, to share that bond with Andy Tartaglino.

Cox\Annapolis\Benefits of recycling are worth the cost\The Nov. 12 Opinion Commentary piece by Christopher Douglass, ""Recycling revisited,"" was extremely myopic, viewing this issue through the single, distorting lens of current economic theory. To argue that some items should not be recycled because the benefit/cost ratio is insufficient is too simplistic for such an important issue.\Our society has deemed many items desirable even though their ratio would argue against implementation. For example, cars would be cheaper if we did not require air bags and seat belts. Fire codes add costs to construction, but we decided the ratio actually warrants their inclusion by defining benefits to include human lives and costs to include the potential of lost productivity. In other words, costs and benefits are defined by us.\As a trained ecologist I have always found it amusing that ecology has appropriated many analytical tools from economists, especially cost/benefit analyses, but the majority of mainstream economists refuse to expand their definition of costs and benefits to include the extensive information generated by ecologists.\Our environment provides many services to humanity, but these ecosystem services and direct and indirect services are rarely incorporated into economic calculation. Mr. Douglass' presentation certainly ignored them.\His approach also completely ignored the fact that as the human population continues to grow we will continue to stress our environment unless we radically rethink our approach toward nature. Recycling, unless it pollutes more, is one obvious way. If the costs of recycling are presently high, let's create new technologies and educate consumers to reduce them. But regardless, the benefits are too important to forego.\We need to emphasize stewardship and a long-range view, neither of which are currently incorporated into our market system. We also need to do what is morally right. If we do not, unfortunately, Mother Nature will have the final say and she might not be too happy with the all too numerous, short-sighted, often self-centered species that is us.\Kim C.

293,"
State lawmakers returned to work in Annapolis this week, and their agenda for the 90-day General Assembly session will include plenty of environmental issues.
\
Environmental issues will jockey for attention with other hot topics during what's expected to be a busy session. Lawmakers will deal with redistricting, gay marriage, a gas tax and a tight budget.
\
But lobbyists for environmental groups will make a strong push for their agenda. They say Maryland can't afford to wait to tackle environmental topics, especially finding ways to pay for and speed up Chesapeake Bay restoration programs.
\
The state must comply with a federal ""pollution diet"" that mandates reductions in nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment pollution that fouls the bay.
\
If Maryland doesn't speed up pollution-busting efforts, it could eventually get into trouble with the feds.
\
""The overall goal is to keep the state on track,"" said Tommy Landers, director of the advocacy group Environment Maryland.
\
Maryland has made progress toward a cleaner bay, said Kim Coble, vice president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
\
""Maryland has crafted a good plan to sustain our momentum. Now lawmakers must do the right thing to ensure the plan goes into action,"" Coble said in a statement.
\
Here's a look at what lawmakers will tackle.
\
'Flush fee'
\
Lawmakers will consider a raising the ""flush fee"" to raise more money for pollution-busting practices.
\
A task force set up by the governor has recommended doubling the fee from $30 per home to $60 next year, followed by another increase to $90 in two years.
\
Environmental groups working together as the ""Clean Water, Healthy Families"" coalition are pushing to increase the fee to $120 per year.
\
Residents pay $30 per year for the flush fee, with the money going into the state's Bay Restoration Fund. In Anne Arundel, most residents pay the fee on their quarterly water and sewer bills.
\
Commercial property owners pay into the flush fee based on the amount of water and sewage they use.
\
The money currently goes to upgrading sewage plants, installing high-tech septic systems and planting winter cover crops at farms.
\
Lawmakers also may consider the task force's recommendation to allow using the flush fee money for stormwater pollution controls, too.
\
Stormwater fee
\
For several years now, lawmakers have ditched proposals that would have required local governments to set up a stormwater fee.
\
They'll take the issue up again this year.
\
Money collected from a fee would be used to pay for collecting and treating stormwater, which is the only source of bay pollution that's increasing. Stormwater is a particular problem in urban and suburban areas.
\
The City of Annapolis has such a fee, but Anne Arundel County does not.
\
County Councilman Chris Trumbauer, D-Annapolis, recently dropped his attempt to create a stormwater fee for Anne Arundel, wanting to see what state lawmakers would do.
\
The County Council voted down a similar proposal in 2007.
\
Septics and sprawl
\
Gov. Martin O'Malley ruffled feathers last year when he pushed a ban on using septic systems in most new housing developments.
\
The governor's idea was to curb sprawl that creeps into rural areas, as well as limit pollution, as septic systems allow for more bay-harming nitrogen to reach the water than sewage plants.
\
The bill tanked, but O'Malley hasn't given up.
\
In an end-of-the-year meeting with reporters, O'Malley vowed to raise the issue again. He's expected to unveil a new bill in the next week or so.
\
Some environmentalists would like to see the state set limits on how much pollution can come from septic systems.
\
Look for business interest groups - including Maryland Business for Responsive Government - to oppose any limits on septic systems, arguing that it would hurt economic development efforts in rural areas.
\
Republican and rural lawmakers will fight against the bill, but they're waiting to see what O'Malley's proposal will be, said House Minority Leader Tony O'Donnell.
\
On the sprawl front, the advocacy group 1000 Friends of Maryland expects to be busy trying to focus growth in existing communities, preserving farms and undeveloped lands and funneling tax dollars to ""smart growth"" projects.
\
Wind power
\
Environmentalists will be pushing for wind power again in Annapolis.
\
Last year, lawmakers killed a bill that would have required utility companies such as BGE to buy a certain percentage of their electricity for wind power.
\
That would guarantee customers for wind farms that would be built off the coast of Ocean City.
\
The bill would have likely resulted in a few dollars added onto Marylanders' electric bills, which did not sit well with lawmakers.
\
Environmentalists have wasted no time in promoting wind power this year - they were rallying for their cause on Lawyers Mall on the first day of the session on Wednesday.
\
Hydraulic fracking
\
Energy companies are seeking approval to use a drilling technique called hydraulic fracturing to extract natural gas from parts of Western Maryland.
\
But environmentalists and some residents are worried that the process - which injects liquid into the ground and drilling vertically to break up shale formations - could have disastrous environmental and public health consequences.
\
A bill last year that would have banned ""fracking"" for two years died, but the Maryland Department of the Environment has been taking its time in reviewing drilling permit applications for fracking.
\
Meanwhile an O'Malley-appointed task force issued a report this week, recommending the state impose fees and taxes on fracking projects in the Marcellus Shale formation in Western Maryland. The task force also recommends lawmakers pass laws to protect property owners who allow fracking on their land.
\
Bags and bottles
\
Adding taxes to plastic bags and bottles are perennial topics in Annapolis that seem to go nowhere. But each year, advocates point to more and more jurisdictions adopting such taxes, and claim they are getting closer to a statewide tax.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Political Notes is a weekly look at government and political news. Send items to rhutzell@mdgazette.com.
\
Beverley Swaim-Staley, the first woman to take over as secretary for the state Department of Transportation, faces a rough ride while guiding Maryland's infrastructure during troubled times.
\
Appointed this week by Gov. Martin O'Malley, Swaim-Staley has been acting secretary since her predecessor, John Porcari, left to take a job with President Barack Obama's administration. Her nomination is subject to confirmation by the state Senate.
\
""She understands transportation,"" O'Malley said. ""It is my hope that in the years ahead, these will be years of progress.""
\
Swaim-Staley, a Davidsonville resident, was deputy secretary of the department after being the director of the Office of Budget and Management for Montgomery County from 2003 to 2007. She also served as deputy secretary and chief financial officer of the Hanover-based department from 1993 to 1997.
\
Transportation has been a challenging area for the O'Malley administration as the global recession takes big chunks out of the budget.
\
More than $1 billion worth of projects had to be cut last summer and the state has continually dipped into funds designated for local highway projects to cover its deficits. For example, Anne Arundel County has now lost 90 percent of its highway-user revenue, down to $1 million from about $10.3 million.
\
""We use these challenges to make sure we are as cost-effective as we can be so that we are prepared on that day when our financial woes are not so great,"" Swaim-Staley said. ""Unfortunately for the state and the counties, we are all in this together.""
\
Mass-transit projects such as the $1.5 billion Purple Line from Bethesda to New Carrollton and strengthening current infrastructure will be priorities, she said.
\
Swaim-Staley also wants to focus on finishing work with the federal stimulus program, which is pumping $628 million into Maryland's depleted coffers. She said she hopes it can serve as a bridge between the recession and an economic recovery.
\
""The stimulus package has been very helpful to help us keep up with many of our system-preservation needs,"" the secretary said.
\
When asked directly if she would support a gas-tax hike to help boost the state's transportation trust fund, Swaim-Staley demurred and said the greater priority is to help the federal government make its near-bankrupt transportation accounts sustainable.
\
""It's going to be important to find new ways to fund transportation,"" she said. ""How revenue sources fit into that is going to be part of the dialogue.""
\
Public to feds: Clean the bay
\
The federal government heard this week from 19,000 people and 25 environmental groups, all asking for a stepped-up effort to restore the Chesapeake Bay.
\
Standing outside the waterfront Environmental Protection Agency office in Annapolis on Tuesday, the federal government's point person on the bay, Chuck Fox, symbolically accepted stacks of postcards signed by thousands of people who care about the bay.
\
""This is clearly showing me 19,000 people have a tremendous passion and energy for saving the bay,"" Fox said.
\
The postcard signatures were drummed up by the staff of Environment Maryland and Environment Virginia. They took the postcards on door-knocking campaigns and to meetings around the bay this summer, including one last month in Annapolis that drew a crowd of more than 300.
\
In addition to the postcards, advocates led by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation also presented a letter to the EPA offering a laundry list of actions the federal government can take to improve the bay.
\
They included establishing a tough ""pollution budget,"" going after polluters with tougher enforcement and beefing up efforts to cut air pollution that harms the bay.
\
The letter was signed by 25 advocacy groups, ranging from local riverkeepers to bay foundation officials and the National Wildlife Federation.
\
Senior Republicans
\
The Anne Arundel Senior Republican Club will meet Sept. 14, a week later than normally scheduled, because of the Labor Day holiday.
\
The meeting will be at 2 p.m. at the North County library, 1010 Eastway in Glen Burnie.

295," MEXICO CITY -- A famous Mexican cartoonist once proposed a brilliant idea for ridding Mexico City of its choking smog.\ Abel Quezada's plan would go into effect during Easter vacation after millions flee the city for the beaches and countryside.\ Upon their return, the vacationers would find all access roads blocked and their cars forever barred from the city.\ Now with the Easter vacation at hand, the late cartoonist's satirical solution seems like a sensible plan. The Mexican capital is now in the third week of its worst pollution crisis.\ While rains and wind have improved the situation slightly, the only real end in sight is the Easter holiday when many of the city's 3 million cars -- the source of 77 percent of the pollution -- leave to foul someone else's air.\ The smog crisis has led to finger-pointing, fears of ""ecocide"" and a substantial dent in the presidential ambitions of the city's mayor.\ Indeed, Mayor Manuel Comacho Solis' bid for the presidency in 1994 is up in the air. He's had seven years to fight the dreaded smog, first as federal environment minister and then as head of the world's most polluted city.\ The current crisis began March 16 when ozone reached a record ""very dangerous"" level on the pollution scale -- nearly four times the amount considered safe by the World Health Organization.\ Ozone causes bronchitis, sinusitis, eye irritation and lethargy and can also permanently damage the lungs.\ Data from the national statistics institute show that more than 50,000 capital residents died of respiratory diseases in 1990, at nearly double the rate of some rural states.\ And a recent study by a prominent hospital here found evidence of another pollutant -- lead. One of four schoolchildren in heavily polluted southern Mexico City had alarmingly high levels of lead in their blood, enough to produce learning disorders, the study found.\ When the current crisis hit, schools were ordered closed for a day, industry was told to cut production 30 percent, and people were deprived of the use of their cars two days a week instead of the usual one mandated by earlier anti-pollution efforts.\ But the ozone level still has hovered at or near the ""dangerous"" level, leading to charges of widespread cheating, government incompetence and contamination of gasoline by PEMEX, the state oil monopoly.\ The crisis also produced the usual round of panicky panaceas, from removing a third of the metropolitan area's 18 million people to creating a new national capital in a rural state.\ The core of the government's program rests on taming the automobile, but like many things in Mexico, it is subject to corruption and cheating.\ Since 1990, the government has required all new cars to have catalytic converters so that they can use unleaded gasoline. But many people with new cars buy cheaper leaded gasoline, which ruins the converters after one tankful.\ (Unlike U.S. cars, Mexican-built models can use the pump nozzles for both unleaded and leaded gasoline.)\ Another weak point is the annual inspection to determine if a car meets pollution standards.\ Since the average Mexico City car is about 8 years old, many junkers stand little chance of passing. So the owners resort to the Mexican tradition of the mordida, or bribe. In February, an anti-corruption undercover operation shut down nearly 10 percent of the 680 testing stations because they were taking bribes, Fernando Menendez Garza, the city's smog czar, says.\ Other smog suspicions rest on the the composition of PEMEX's unleaded gas. Humberto Bravo, a pollution specialist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, says that ozone levels rose dramatically after 1986 when the company introduced ""something"" to its unleaded gasoline to reduce lead and sulfur.\ Professor Bravo says that the number of hours that ozone exceeded the World Health Organization norm each year has grown from 740 in 1987 to 1,536 in 1991.\ Still others say there is an urgent need for more public transportation. Luis Manuel Guerra, a member of the metropolitan pollution commission, says that the city needs to increase its fleet of 3,000 large buses by up to 15,000. He suggested paying for them with a 30 percent increase in gas taxes.\ City officials say that they are studying a gas tax increase but that it would be politically impossible this year.\ About 1,500 more buses will be introduced soon, along with a mid-size bus to replace the current mini-buses, Mr. Menendez said.\ Mayor Camacho is the first to admit that the city is in an ozone crisis, but he also notes that in the past two years the levels of three other major pollutants -- sulfur, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide -- have remained within WHO norms.\ Mr. Guerra, a chemical engineer, says that the city daily produces about 11,000 tons of pollutants, about the same level as in 1990, even though there are now 200,000 more cars. He figures anti-pollution measures are preventing another 2,000 tons a day from entering the air.\ The mayor, as head of the pollution commission, is now embarked on a tough program to convert all public transportation vehicles to liquid propane. Telmex, the telephone company, announced it was converting its 4,000 vehicles to propane.\ The government also has announced a crackdown on polluting industries: Either clean up or shut down by September 1993.\ Within days of the announcement, General Motors Corp. said it would move its Mexico City truck plant to a $400 million facility it is building in Guanajuato state. Two other huge transnational companies are expected to make similar announcements soon.\ Meanwhile, the government leaked a letter from the president of Colgate-Palmolive's Mexican subsidiary saying the company would spend $50 million to remove polluting ""processes"" to other parts of the country over the next three years.\ The Colgate plant, the largest in Mexico City with 4,000 workers, also promised to submit to arbitration over whether it is violating pollution laws. The company says it's in compliance; the city says it isn't.\ The industrial crackdown angered many businessmen who charged privately that Mayor Camacho and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari were grandstanding. They said their companies had already signed cleanup agreements and installed anti-smog devices.\ In its haste to appear to be doing something, the government included IBM and General Electric Co. on its priority cleanup list of 181 big companies. Neither has a plant in the Mexico City area.\ According to the government's figures, the 30,000 industries in Mexico City and 17 suburban communities produce 78 percent of the sulfur pollution and 12.6 percent of the nitrogen oxide.\ Its plan to curb pollution sets aside funds to help companies meet the requirements or move outside the metropolitan area. It also commissions outside inspectors to augment the federal environment agency's 50-man force."
296,"As a strong supporter of the Master Plan Alignment for the Intercounty Connector (ICC) since entering public office in 1991, I am extremely disappointed, but unfortunately not surprised, that Gov. Parris N. Glendening has decided not to proceed with the ICC.\While this road is controversial, it is also vital to the economic fortunes of the capital region and critical to enable its citizens to commute safely and effectively.\The ICC's elimination leaves the citizens of Howard and Montgomery counties without a safe or convenient transportation system -- and will force commuters to continue to rely on a patchwork of local roads for east-west travel.\The governor's decision largely nullifies the work of the Transportation Solutions Group Mr. Glendening created and undoes years of public planning.\While the governor's reason for rejecting a major portion of the ICC is the road's potential negative environmental impact, Mr. Glendening is prepared to allow dredged material from the Baltimore Harbor to be dumped in the Chesapeake Bay. The inconsistency is very evident.\Clearly, a wide range of alternatives are needed to address the region's transportation needs.\But the governor's plan also calls for selling state-owned lands that could provide transportation alternatives. This will foreclose future options.\In my opinion, these actions signify a lack of vision.\Christopher J. McCabe, Clarksville\The writer represents the 14th Legislative District in the Maryland Senate.\Gov. Parris N. Glendening's decision to kill the Intercounty Connector is a blow to Maryland's economy and quality of life. It will hurt the Port of Baltimore, the Baltimore-Washington International Airport corridor and personal and commercial movement in upper Montgomery County.\Environmental groups are elated. They say stopping highway improvements such as the ICC will cause people to drive less. But who's going to drive less as a result of this decision?\The governor says it is time to ""get serious about mass transit."" But Maryland now spends as much on mass transit as on its highway network, although highways serve 95 percent of personal travel. How much more serious can we get?\Citizens should take heart that state Comptroller William Donald Schaefer and Treasurer Richard N. Dixon are challenging the governor's ill-conceived move (""Schaefer on attack over ICC,"" Sept. 30).\Robert E. Latham, Glen Burnie\The writer is executive director of Marylanders for Efficient and Safe Highways, a highway advocacy group.\Building more highways won't cure congestion\As a member of the Maryland General Assembly, I'd like to respond to The Sun's article ""State, local leaders vow to revive intercounty highway connector plan"" (Sept. 26).\Shame on those officials for pursuing a road the voters do not want, which would be an environmental disaster if built. Gov. Parris N. Glendening is doing the right thing in killing this proposal, especially for our children and grandchildren.\The ICC wouldn't even come close to meeting the transportation needs of Montgomery and Prince Georges counties and would not, in the end, move people or cars any faster.\It might for a while move people to and from work more quickly. But we've seen time and again that more roads lead to more traffic and more congestion -- and then, guess what? We need more roads.\We can do much more with $1.5 billion than build a short ribbon of road that could be outdated before it's finished.\We need a comprehensive mass transportation system to move people in all directions -- a combination of bus, overhead and underground rail, light rail and other transportation lines.\Why don't we put the money into finding different transportation solutions -- ones that move people, rather than move more cars on highways we don't need.\Mary A. Conroy, Annapolis\The writer represents the 23rd District in the Maryland House of Delegates.\Exit ramps would enhance city's proposed bus station\Finally, planners have come to their senses and decided to place the new bus terminal near the Pennsylvania Station train terminal (""Greyhound hopes to create hub,"" Sept. 23).\This good decision echoes similar designs all over the world. Placing the bus station near the train station enables passengers to transfer easily from one mode of transportation to the other.\The city's current bus station is buried in the inner city, hard to find and hard to reach. Traffic on the city streets impedes the inter-city buses, making trips longer and slower than they need to be.\The new location would be close to the Jones Falls Expressway, which is the city's major connection to the surrounding highway system.\To make it easier to reach the train/bus station from the JFX, I'd envision a dedicated off-ramp from the JFX southbound to the train/ bus station and an on-ramp from the station to the northbound JFX.\This would imitate the design of Baltimore-Washington International Airport.\If we can invest hundreds of millions of dollars into our airport, we can certainly find a couple million for some highway ramps for the bus/train station.\Joe Cotton, Baltimore\Asthmatics, environment need more pollution control\What big teeth the tobacco industry has (""Maryland, a pacesetter in fighting big tobacco,"" Opinion Commentary, Sept. 29). But I'm more afraid of the region's Transportation Steering Committee (""Polluted air hits asthmatics hard,"" Sept. 29).\The way it deliberately used outdated traffic emission data to qualify for federal highway funding was devious.\Why shouldn't non-smoking asthma victims sue the state for breach of public trust? Lawyers are getting rich prosecuting tobacco companies, then climbing into SUVs and driving home in smog.\Yet, while hybrid cars (part gas, part electric) that offer motorists clean alternatives are about to debut in America, Gov. Parris N. Glendening recently nixed a gas-tax hike. That won't help these fledgling little hybrids sell like crabcakes.\The environment can't afford inexpensive gas anymore. Like asthmatics, it needs politicians it can trust.\D. P. Birch, Baltimore\Government was right to shift gears on tobacco\Andrew Glass' column ""Hypocrisy and tobacco"" (Opinion Commentary, Sept 27) paints the federal government as a terrible hypocrite for having once encouraged tobacco use and now suing tobacco companies for doing the same thing.\But Mr. Glass utterly ignores that, when research in the 1950s and 1960s unveiled tobacco's dangers, the government's position changed, while the tobacco companies continued their drumbeat of sales messages.\He also misstates the military experience, claiming that if you didn't have something to smoke when the sergeant said ""Smoke 'em if you got em,"" you'd be set to scrubbing pots.\Nonsense. At Fort Dix, I scrubbed pots when I was on KP duty. When the sergeant gave us a break, we stood around and talked -- whether or not we had something to smoke.\Nobody kept a supply of dirty pots in the field to keep nonsmokers busy.\Al McKegg, West Friendship\Stop using drug war to undermine our freedom\Gregory Kane's column on the police invasion of Gloria Brown's house was right on the money (""Police raid on home more damaging to civil liberties than drug trafficking,"" Oct. 3). It's high time the police and the government were held accountable for such abuses of power.\I'm tired of seeing our government use the drug war to destroy our liberties, and thus the Constitution itself. Eradicating drugs is not worth giving up the freedom our forefathers fought and died for.\Thane Bellomo, Baltimore\To our readers The Sun welcomes letters from readers.

297,"Havre de Grace -- Harford County Executive David R. Craig describes himself as a moderate by temperament, but he is staking out positions that seem certain to appeal to the Republican party's hard-core conservative base as he seeks the 2014 nomination for governor.\In recent weeks, Craig has articulated policy stands that put him well to the conservative side of Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. in his 2002 race for governor -- the only gubernatorial election the Maryland GOP has won in four decades. On the environment, social services and other issues, Craig has virtually dared his Republican rivals -- Anne Arundel County Del. Ron George and Charles County business executive Charles Lollar -- to try to outflank him on the right. \Among other things, Craig wants to scale back Maryland's role in the Chesapeake Bay cleanup, give the state's business department a greater voice in environmental and health regulations, and impose limits on how long low-income people can collect food stamps and other benefits -- even if it means refusing federal money. \Craig, 64, insists his positions represent the experiences of a lifetime as an educator and public official -- not a strategy for winning the June 24 primary in an increasingly conservative party. ""It's not like we're trying to move to the right or left. It's being correct,"" he said. \Political observers say Craig appears to be positioning himself to compete in a primary in which staunch conservatives are the most reliable voters. The challenge facing Craig -- or whoever wins the primary -- will be to appeal to a much different electorate in the general election. In Maryland, Democrats have a more than 2-to-1 advantage in voter registration over Republicans. \Richard Vatz, a professor of rhetoric at Towson University and a Craig supporter, said the numbers pose a dilemma for Republican gubernatorial candidates. \""The fact is, you often have to take positions in primaries that are not going to be positions that win you a general election,"" Vatz said. ""That's the reason it's very difficult for even an attractive [Republican] candidate to win in Maryland."" \John T. Willis, executive in residence at the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Baltimore, said a pivot after the primary is more difficult now that recording devices are ubiquitous. \""Everything you say in the primary can be used against you for the general [election],"" Willis said. A candidate who tries to swing too far back to the center after a primary risks being labeled a flip-flopper, he added. \George said he's seen a rightward shift by Craig. \""I think he's been looking at the polls and he's taking different positions than what he has in the past,"" George said. The delegate said he has established a solid conservative record in his two terms in the legislature and sees no need to change his approach. \Lollar said he was not familiar with Craig's recent positions. \State GOP leaders have discussed allowing independents -- roughly 17 percent of Maryland's 3.7 million voters -- to cast ballots in the Republican primary, but that would require action at the party's convention next month. Such a proposal could face resistance from conservatives because it might favor candidates perceived as more moderate. \Craig has governed Harford since 2005, making him the longest-serving executive in county history. In 2010, he was re-elected with nearly 80 percent of the vote. \The landslide victory came after Craig compiled a record of fiscal conservatism and tax-cutting combined with a genial, nonconfrontational style. ""I'm considered a moderate because of my temperament,"" Craig said in an interview at his restored, circa-1839 home. \Michael Bennett, the Democratic mayor of Aberdeen, isn't backing Craig for governor but says it's been a pleasure to work with him as county executive. \""For the most part, I've seen that he's been a moderate -- a kind of middle-of-the-road guy,"" said Bennett, who has been mayor for almost six years. \Such descriptions are not necessarily an asset in an increasingly conservative Republican Party. \Richard Cross, a former Ehrlich speechwriter turned blogger on Maryland Republican politics, said he has seen online attacks on Craig from the hard right labeling him a ""RINO"" -- for Republican in Name Only, an epithet sometimes hurled at those who deviate from conservative orthodoxy. \Cross said that while the Harford executive has the image of a moderate, his positions on such issues as food stamps could reassure the conservative base. \""It helps him connect with a constituency that might regard him skeptically,"" Cross said. \Among the conservatives who stand behind Craig is Ellen R. Sauerbrey, the two-time Republican nominee for governor and favorite of the party's right wing. \""If people think David is a RINO, I think they're very wrong,"" said Sauerbrey, who served with Craig in the House of Delegates in the early 1990s when she was minority leader. \Craig has been beefing up his conservative credentials as he has waded deeper into the statewide political scene. When the General Assembly passed a law in 2012 requiring some counties to impose fees to finance projects that would reduce runoff into the Chesapeake Bay, Craig's first reaction was to reluctantly comply. Recently, however, he urged the County Council to repeal the fee that conservatives have derided as a ""rain tax."" He is making repeal of the fee a central issue of his campaign. \That stance is part of his broader view that Maryland should back off from some of its more aggressive anti-pollution efforts. Craig has challenged Maryland's traditional role of leadership among the states in the bay watershed, questioning whether it should get out ahead of Pennsylvania and New York, which contribute to the bay's pollution but have less stake in its condition. \Craig said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should take the lead -- but only after the federal government has fixed its own pollution problems and the agency has proved that its rules will be effective. If that means a delay in cleaning up the bay, he said, he sees no urgency. \""Some people would say it's been dirty since the 1830s,"" he said. ""Some people say it's going to be dirty forever."" \In a previous interview, Craig had suggested repeal of the 1984 Critical Area Act, a landmark law limiting development on the land closest to the bay and its tributaries. Last week, he backed off that stance, saying the legislation should be re-examined, not eliminated. \Likewise, Craig dialed back a recent suggestion by an aide that he would give the Department of Business and Economic Development veto authority over regulations proposed by other departments -- such as environment, health and labor -- if the rules could cost Maryland jobs. Last week, Craig said the business agency would review such rules but would not have a veto. \As Craig has modified stances on a few issues, he's taken a hard-right position on others. \On transportation, he would reserve three of the largest sources of revenue -- the gas tax, vehicle registration fees and titling taxes -- for spending on roads and bridges, not mass transit. To fund Baltimore-area bus and rail lines, he would require riders to pay 50 percent of the cost of running the system -- a proposal that would raise the current base fare of $1.60 to $2.90, according to legislative analysts. \Craig said he would like to see limits on food stamps and other welfare benefits, even when the federal government provides many of the resources. \Todd Eberly, a professor of political science at St. Mary's College in Southern Maryland, has called Craig a strong Republican candidate. But the rightward turn has made Eberly more skeptical about Craig's chances in a general election. \""I still view him as the strongest statewide candidate for the Republicans, but if he's not careful he will completely undo that advantage,"" Eberly said. \Sauerbrey, who narrowly lost the gubernatorial election to Democrat Parris N. Glendening in 1994, thinks Craig is positioned right where he needs to be to win in November 2014. \""I think he's offering solutions that the state badly needs,"" she said, ""and the majority of people in this state feel sick and tired of being overtaxed and over-regulated."" \Baltimore Sun reporter Erin Cox contributed to this article. \mdresser@baltsun.com\Credit: The Baltimore Sun"
298,"When Republican Larry Hogan and Democrat Anthony G. Brown discuss the business climate in Maryland, it seems as if the gubernatorial rivals are talking about two different states.\Hogan's Maryland is a terrible place to do business, a state where companies and residents are streaming for the borders to escape oppressive taxation and capricious regulations. His remedy: tax and spending cuts coupled with business-friendly appointments to regulatory agencies. \Brown's Maryland is the state with the highest household median income and a blue-chip AAA bond rating, where top-quality educational resources and strategic investments fuel the nation's No. 1 entrepreneurial culture. \The state has some problems with cumbersome licensing and regulation, Brown says, but he adds that he has a plan to ease that burden. \Driving their plans is a fundamental disagreement over the course Maryland has charted the last eight years under Gov. Martin O'Malley. \""The state of the business climate in Maryland is horrible over the past eight years. It's deteriorated in a frightening way,"" Hogan said. \Brown argues that the last eight years have been marked by steady progress in the face of the worst economic downturn since the Depression. He notes that Maryland has weathered the recession without the sharp spending cuts many other states made. \""We can't abandon the work that we've done, the investments we've made, the success we've had in such areas as education, college affordability, safe neighborhoods and the progress we're making on the environment,"" Brown said. \Neutral observers aren't buying into either Hogan's apocalyptic vision or Brown's relatively sunny assessment. \""It's something in the middle,"" said Dairius Irani, chief economist at the Regional Economic Studies Institute at Towson University. \Hogan's economy-centered campaign is built around a core narrative of a state in such decline that four more years of O'Malley-Brown policies will cause irreversible damage. \On the campaign trail and in his ads, he delivers a rapid-fire critique of Maryland's economy: 8,000 small businesses gone or closed in the O'Malley years, unemployment almost doubled. \But at least one of Hogan's claims doesn't hold up under scrutiny. \His central premise -- that he could pare back spending without cutting essential services -- rests on his assertion that the state's auditors uncovered $1.75 billion in waste, fraud and abuse under the O'Malley administration. Hogan's numbers do not add up. \A Baltimore Sun review of three cases in the audits Hogan cites found that his $1.75 billion figure is inflated by at least $843 million, or roughly half. \*In one case, the campaign put a decimal point in the wrong place. Questionable spending on business tax credits that a February 2012 audit put at $11.95 million was counted by Hogan as $119.5 million, a $107.5 million error. \*In another, the campaign noted tax assessors undervalued some land by $285 million, according to a 2013 audit. Were the land properly valued, the state would have received about $319,200 more in property tax revenue. The Hogan campaign erroneously said the state missed out on $285 million -- money it would never have received unless the state set tax rates at 100 percent. \*The campaign cites an April 2013 audit that found the agency distributing school construction money did not have an adequate system to track 126 projects worth $450 million. The same audit said the agency resolved its tracking problems before the report was released. Though there was no suggestion that $450 million was misspent, the Hogan campaign counted the sum as waste, fraud and abuse. \Hogan's campaign did not dispute The Baltimore Sun's findings but argued that its review of 52 of 300 audits during the O'Malley administration still suggests lax monetary controls and government waste. ""The fact remains that ... potentially billions of our tax dollars have been wasted by the O'Malley-Brown administration,"" campaign spokesman Adam Dubitsky said. \While some of his assertions may be in question, there's no doubt that Hogan's narrative of a stagnating economy and a ""mass exodus"" from high taxes resonates with voters such as Jerry Kirby of Cambridge, whom Hogan met while campaigning in that town recently. \""If this election goes the wrong way, I'm out of here,"" Kirby told Hogan. ""I can't stand these taxes."" \Hogan says that his long-term goal is to roll back what he calls O'Malley's ""40 consecutive tax increases"" -- a list that includes not only tax hikes, but fees, tolls and increases in bus and other transit fares required by state law. By Hogan's calculation, the various increases have brought in about $9.5 billion in state revenue -- much more than he has identified in potential budget cuts. \In the short term, Hogan has called for tax cuts in general terms, but he has not offered specifics. He has spoken favorably of proposals for a reduction of the state corporate income tax from 8.25 percent to 6 percent. He's also said he favors cutting the personal income tax and ending taxation of retirement income. \He has not released a position paper costing out the impact of his proposals. Hogan has waved off questions about specific cuts to areas such as education and health care, vowing to find savings to pay for tax cuts by eliminating waste. \Hogan says he will back up his tax and spending policies with appointments of experienced business people to high positions in the agencies that write and enforce regulations. He said his election would bring an immediate improvement in a business climate ranked 41st out of the 50 states in one study. \""That would change on day one, because you'd have a governor who was unabashedly pro-business,"" Hogan said. ""Our attitude on how to deal with business would be changed 180 degrees."" \Todd Eberly, a political scientist at St. Mary's College, said Hogan's narrative may be well suited to a time when the middle-class economic standing has fallen to early-1990s levels \""For a Republican in Maryland, it's probably the message that has to work,"" he said, referring to Democrats' 2-to-1 advantage in voter registration. \Brown, meanwhile, is trying to sell voters on a nuanced program to improve Maryland's business climate. He's portraying Maryland as a place with significant strengths as well as weaknesses. \According to Brown, Maryland does well in some measures of quality of life that business cares about -- the quality of the workforce, its schools, its transportation network. He proudly points to the state's No. 1 ranking by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for entrepreneurship. \But, Brown says, ""there are other areas where Maryland doesn't fare so well."" In particular, he said the state's regulatory environment is overly burdensome for businesses. Brown said one of his priorities will be to streamline and speed up the regulatory and licensing functions of government. \""Business people don't want [you] to promise them that their request is going to be approved, but what they do want is a timely response to their request,"" he said. \Brown said that while the state's business climate was not one of the original 15 ""strategic goals"" set by the O'Malley-Brown administration, it would be in his own administration. \""The No. 1 and first-announced strategic goal will be to position Maryland to be the most competitive business climate in the nation,"" he said. \Brown contends that sweeping tax cuts are neither necessary nor desirable to improve the state's business climate. He said he has been consulting with business leaders extensively, even before launching his campaign, and has put together a business advisory council involving more than 100 companies. \In place of a broad corporate tax cut, which Brown contends would benefit mostly big businesses, he is proposing help for smaller, home-grown firms. \""We're going to start with our small entrepreneurial business community with targeted tax cuts,"" he said. Some of those cuts, he said, would likely be directed at potential growth areas such as cyber security, life sciences, and research and development. \Brown also points to his support for infrastructure spending, including road and transit projects financed by the 2013 bill that raised Maryland's gas tax for the first time in more than 20 years. He noted that his support for construction of the Red Line in Baltimore -- at a cost of about $2.6 billion -- is much more in line with the position of the Greater Baltimore Committee than Hogan's outright opposition to the light rail projects. \""One of their top priorities is the Red Line. They view that as essential to ensuring the Baltimore business community is competitive,"" he said. \Eberly said Brown faces a distinct disadvantage in rolling out his plans for a change of direction in Maryland's business climate -- the question of where his plan has been for the last eight years. \""You don't get to be the No. 2 man and just sort of sit on your hands for eight years,"" Eberly said. \michael.dresser@baltsun.com \About this article \This is the third in a series of occasional articles on the candidates' positions on issues in the governor's race.\Credit: The Baltimore Sun"
299,"Last spring, the night before the final legislative session of his two terms ended, Gov. Martin O'Malley couldn't sleep.\Instead of continuing to fret about whether the legislature would pass his bill to raise the minimum wage, O'Malley wrote a 1,684-word letter to his staff about the victories and struggles of his years in office, outlining the six qualities he believed made a ""good leader."" \Among them, he wrote, ""Good leaders make themselves vulnerable -- it is the only way they get difficult things done."" \O'Malley leaves public office Wednesday for the first time in more than 23 years, leaving behind a substantial record of accomplishments at the city and state levels. His tenure also makes him vulnerable to criticism that he moved the state to the left and raised more taxes than the electorate could tolerate. \Both Democrats and Republicans consider O'Malley extremely effective at pushing his policies through the legislature. Yet they describe the Democrat's legacy in sharply partisan terms. O'Malley has either been a charismatic, national leader who pulled Maryland through an economic recession or a tax-and-spend liberal who went too far. \""History will judge him as a governor who accomplished quite a bit, whether you like him or don't like him,"" said House Speaker Michael E. Busch, a fellow Democrat. \O'Malley ushered through landmark social policy bills legalizing same-sex marriage, granting discounted university tuition to some immigrants in the country illegally, repealing the death penalty and enacting strict new gun control laws. \Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller said O'Malley has been the most effective Maryland governor since the mid-1970s, but his success in pulling Maryland to the left came with a price -- one that was reflected in the November election, when Republican Gov.-elect Larry Hogan defeated O'Malley's preferred successor. \""Because of his politics, a majority of the subdivisions of the state felt neglected,"" Miller, a Democrat, said. \O'Malley closed the troubled 19th-centery House of Corrections in Jessup in his first term, but a gang scandal erupted at the state-run Baltimore City Detention Center during his second. While the state's online health insurance marketplace enrolled record numbers of people in private plans and Medicaid this year, last year it had one of the worst rollouts in the nation. \He increased sales taxes and income taxes on high-income earners and created new taxes on services. He also raised the gas tax for the first time in more than two decades and increased the corporate tax rate. \""O'Malley's legacy is the strongest Republican Party since the 1920s,"" said Joe Cluster, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party. ""He was a strong campaigner, he won two elections, but in the end, his policies created an environment that will bring this state closer to being a two-party state."" \Even some Democrats agree that the Republican wave that took the governor's mansion and a record number of House of Delegate seats was sparked, in part, by O'Malley's push to raise taxes. \""We were, in retrospect, a bit too aggressive in that department,"" said House Economic Matters Chairman Dereck Davis, a Prince George's County Democrat. \""The party led by the governor, point blank, was too aggressive in trying to maintain the status quo,"" Davis said. ""You have to make tough choices, even if they're just temporary, you have to make those [budget] cuts. You have to slow things down. We were unwilling to say no to anybody, about anything."" \O'Malley and his defenders argue the tax increases were necessary to keep investing in schools and to stave off painful cuts during the nationwide recession. O'Malley inherited a $1.7 billion structural deficit when he took over from Republican Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich in 2007. This year, that deficit stands at an estimated $750 million -- a reduction of nearly a billion dollars. \""He governed during very difficult times, and he didn't want to use that as an excuse not to make progress,"" said O'Malley's former chief of staff, Matt Gallagher. ""We wouldn't. ... He blazed new trails, he found creative ways to get things done, and all going into a pretty hard economic headwind."" \O'Malley also cut the state workforce by 6,000. By his count, the state government is now smaller per capita than it has been since 1973. And while O'Malley did increase the annual rate of state spending each year, he did it by smaller percentages than any of the four previous governors. \The governor acknowledged that he has developed a reputation for raising taxes. On his blog, he relayed an anecdote about setting up a heating oil account for his new home in Baltimore. He wrote that when the operator asked for his last name: \""O'Malley,"" I answered. ""Like the out-going governor."" \""Ah, yes,"" she said. ""The 'tax man'..."" \O'Malley said he has struggled to convey to Marylanders what he has been doing as governor -- a task that was easier when he was Baltimore's mayor. \""I've had many people, even years later, thank me for helping them or a family member get into a drug treatment program during the city's turnaround; I've never had one of the 700,000 citizens who, for the first time now, have health care ever acknowledge the state's role in making this possible."" \Plenty of others have taken notice of O'Malley's work. He used a data-driven method to manage government, earning him accolades from national magazines as wonky as Governing and as hip as Esquire. \Among the data-based accomplishments he cites: Violent crime has been reduced by 27.3 percent; infant mortality has declined by 17.5 percent overall, and by 25 percent among African-Americans. But his published goals show he has also fallen short in a few areas. The recent heroin epidemic, for instance, reversed any progress O'Malley's administration had made toward reducing overdose deaths by 20 percent; instead, they're up 7.4 percent. \Asked about his legacy, O'Malley said he's uncomfortable with the word. Instead, he said he hopes that this ""new way of governing that we brought forward will continue."" \""Agree or disagree with the policy goals, we have been very effective at governing and delivering results, and achieving progress, and solving problems, and doing it in a very open, transparent and collaborative sort of way -- in advance of every other state in America,"" O'Malley said. \He applied that strategy to cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay, relying on data, science and deadlines. \O'Malley championed environmental protection aggressively -- joining Parris N. Glendening and Harry Hughes atop the list of Maryland's ""greenest"" governors. Despite tight fiscal times, he pushed through funding and fee increases intended to help clean up the bay, and tightened regulations on farming and on sprawling development. He also committed the state to reducing climate-altering greenhouse gases and created subsidies for putting wind turbines off Ocean City. \His environmental push, some say, deepened Maryland's rural-urban divide. And Republicans say it was among the many issues that O'Malley used to bolster his credentials for a potential run for president. \""If you look at the boxes that need to be checked for a presidential primary run, it sure looks like every box got checked,"" said former state Sen. E.J. Pipkin, who as Senate minority leader unsuccessfully tried to block many of O'Malley's initiatives. \The governor also secured record funding for education and toward constructing schools -- initiatives paid for in part by ushering in casinos. The cost of tuition in Maryland grew more slowly than in any other state in the country, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. \Yet budget cuts O'Malley pressed for this month, to close another budget gap, have led the University of Maryland system to announce a rare mid-year tuition increase to help cover costs. \Advocates for immigrants and the Latino community said O'Malley did more than any other governor to help their cause -- largely by setting a new tone for discussing policy for what O'Malley called ""new Americans,"" said Gustavo Torres, executive director of Casa de Maryland. \O'Malley signed a law that allows people in the country illegally to get drivers licenses, and publicly contradicted the White House on how to deal with the tens of thousands of young immigrants illegally crossing the border to flee violence in Central America. He also raised the minimum wage for workers here legally, which Torres said helped the Latino community. \On Saturday, the day before his 52nd birthday, O'Malley put seven new posts on his ""Letters to the People of Maryland."" Interspersed with wonky memos about the environment, snippets of poetry and info-graphics about his strategic goals, O'Malley posted a memory about his daughter Grace. \In her college entrance essay from seven years ago, Grace recalled asking her father if he feared his work as a Baltimore public official would be undone after he left office. \O'Malley gave her a poem, that reads in part, ""Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough;/Give the world the best you've got anyway."" \As he leaves office for the first time in decades, O'Malley said he looks at the past this way: ""You don't throw yourself in mosh pit of politics and progress-making without having good days and bad days, successes and failures."" \Baltimore Sun reporters Michael Dresser and Timothy B.

300,"One thing's certain about the General Assembly session that opens Wednesday: It will feature a budget fight.\Otherwise, the 435th session of Maryland's legislature is unpredictable. \Gov.-elect Larry Hogan has been singularly focused on state spending, and he broke with custom by not telling General Assembly leaders what other issues he will pursue. \Democrats, who have dominated all branches of state government, will work with a Republican governor for the first time in eight years. Adding to the uncertainty: The legislature will have its biggest freshman class in at least two decades. \The only issue sure to command attention is a clash over how to close an estimated $750 million shortfall in the budget year that begins July 1. \Funding for transportation projects, colleges, K-12 education, aid to local governments and health programs appear most vulnerable to cuts, legislative leaders said. \""The whole session is going to center around the budget,"" said House Speaker Michael E. Busch, a Democrat. ""The train's coming down the tracks, regardless of the policies people want to talk about."" \Predicting what Hogan might cut in his budget is a guessing game, especially since he has never held elected office before. \""He has no voting record,"" said Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, a Democrat. ""People don't know his prejudices, his partiality."" \Hogan's campaign focused almost exclusively on curbing state spending, rolling back taxes and improving Maryland's business climate. Since his upset win in November, he has remained silent about legislative priorities except to tell reporters last week he will introduce an unspecified tax cut after he takes office Jan. 21. \Yet Hogan's warning that the state's budget needs ""strong medicine"" has put much of Annapolis on the defensive, as lobbyists, lawmakers and advocates prepare to protect causes and state spending they champion. \Conversely, fiscal conservatives and business groups who have been pushing for tax cuts see a window of opportunity and plan to be more aggressive this year. \Hopes for bipartisanship \""We're going to have a better shot at a more bipartisan legislature because we have a Republican governor,"" said House Minority Leader Nic Kipke. ""We're going to have a budget that the state of Maryland can afford, instead of one that rose too quickly and ran up our debt."" \Maryland's governor may propose the budget, but he needs the General Assembly to approve it. And despite several key losses in November, Democrats still hold a significant majority in both chambers. \""The budget is going to be a gigantic bone of contention. It's where all the action is going to be,"" said Del. Kumar Barve, a Democrat and incoming chair of the new House Environment & Transportation Committee. \""Everyone's going to be playing defense,"" Barve said. \Proponents of the taxes on cigarettes, mini-cigars and alcohol that pay for some health programs have largely abandoned plans to push for a further tobacco tax increase. Vincent DeMarco, president of Maryland Health Care for All, said, ""The No. 1 goal for 2015 is to keep the progress we've made."" \Advocates of progressive causes have begun reframing their arguments in budget terms. Environmental leaders plan a pitch that loosening regulations now would create larger cleanup costs later. The American Civil Liberties Union's push to legalize marijuana and increase police accountability will stress how those policies can save taxpayer money. \The state's teachers union will begin airing radio ads Monday promoting K-12 education as key to an improved business climate. \""If [Hogan's] talking about jobs and the economy, then we need to be crystal-clear about the connection between K-12 education and jobs and the economy,"" said Sean Johnson, government relations director for the Maryland State Education Association. \Other legislative concerns \While the budget may suck up the air in the room, advocates and lawmakers have scores of other issues they will bring up for debate. \Natural gas drilling known as fracking, repeal of the ""rain tax"" and regulations to control chicken manure will dominate the environmental committees. Body cameras and police accountability will be debated by the criminal justice committees. Advocates want to fix last year's marijuana decriminalization law, which effectively legalized small amounts of pot, but didn't extend the change to cover rolling papers and other paraphernalia. \Hogan has pledged to address Maryland's heroin epidemic, though he hasn't said how. Economic development groups will push an ""angel investor"" tax credit to help startup companies, while environmentalists will push to increase the amount of electricity generated from renewable sources. Hogan said he will push changes to encourage charter schools, but he has not elaborated. \It's not clear, though, whether anything will get accomplished that's not specifically related to state spending. Unlike many of his predecessors, Hogan during his campaign did not promise action on a wide range of issues. \Maryland Democrats, meanwhile, passed many initiatives on their to-do lists during O'Malley's two terms. And the legislative process will be slowed this year as many new lawmakers will be learning how to do their jobs. \More than 40 percent of the House of Delegates will be serving a first term; a quarter will be new to the Senate. \""People are still figuring out where their offices and parking spaces are,"" said Johnson, of the teachers union. \Mathew Palmer, a senior vice president at the Maryland Chamber of Commerce, said his organization will push a cut in the corporate tax rate and other tax relief for businesses, although he sees the push as a multi-year lobbying effort. \""I don't believe that you're going to see big policy issues moving forward,"" Palmer said. ""You're going to see bills introduced -- you're just not going to see them pass."" \Figuring out Hogan \Everyone wants to figure out the new governor. \""Is he a graphs guy? Is he a report type of person? We just don't know,"" said Dru Schmidt-Perkins, president of the conservation group 1000 Friends of Maryland. ""We're all in the same boat. ... How do we have these types of conversations?"" \Divining how Hogan will interact with the legislature has also become something of an art. \""My impression of the governor-elect is, I don't think he's looking for a big fight,"" said Sen. Bobby Zirkin, incoming chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee. But, he added, ""the big fights are budget fights."" \Del. Maggie McIntosh, incoming chair of the House Appropriations Committee, hopes to combat the notion that Maryland's financial situation is dire. \""I think it's worth setting the record straight. This is not a crisis,"" McIntosh said. She pointed out that the budget committees routinely find $250 million to $500 million in cuts -- amounts that would more than halve next year's shortfall. \Yet the Assembly's budget leaders are bracing for cuts unpopular with many in the Democratic caucus. \Midyear cuts presented by O'Malley last week have already frustrated some interest groups. To help close the estimated $420 million shortfall in the current budget year, O'Malley successfully sought 2 percent across-the-board cuts to many state offices and trimmed millions more from higher education. \Those cuts reduced the rates paid to doctors who treat Medicaid patients, riling the state medical society. If rates are cut further, ""We're not going to have enough doctors to see the patients, and it's going to be an enormous problem,"" said Gene Ransom, the group's CEO. \But for now, Ransom said, ""We're heading in with smiles and optimism."" \ecox@baltsun.com \twitter.com/ErinatTheSun \Issues \Spending and taxes are expected to dominate an otherwise unpredictable General Assembly session, which begins Wednesday. Here are some of the issues on the table: \Budget \Gov.-elect Larry Hogan campaigned almost exclusively on economic issues, promising to curb state spending, roll back taxes and improve Maryland's business climate. When the Republican takes office Jan. 21, he'll face a $750 million budget shortfall and has cautioned residents to prepare for painful cuts. Many in Annapolis expect local governments to get less cash, higher education to see cuts that might cause tuition to rise, and key projects such as the Red Line to be postponed if not scrapped. Hogan said his budget would include some type of tax cut but did not elaborate. \Education \Maryland saw record funding for education under the O'Malley administration, and education advocates are girding for a fight as Hogan looks to trim spending. Colleges have received big subsidies over the past eight years to keep tuition down, and some believe they could be vulnerable to cuts. For K-12 education, legislative leaders expect debate on whether to continue using a geographic cost-of-education formula that sends extra money to some districts, including Baltimore. Hogan has said he plans to push changes to promote charter schools. \Health \A spike in deaths from heroin overdoses and rising crime linked to the drug prompted Hogan to promise action, though he has not offered specifics. Legislative leaders expect debate on how to best combat the epidemic. Among the options: tougher penalties for dealers, more resources for police and better treatment for addicts. Health reform advocates hope to continue expanding access to insurance. The state medical society says cuts to Medicaid reimbursement rates could make it hard for low-income patients to find doctors. \Environment \Proponents hope to move forward with fracking in Western Maryland, while critics still want a ban on such natural gas drilling. Hogan has said he will seek to repeal the stormwater fee, or ""rain tax,"" which raises money to keep polluted stormwater out of the bay, but key Democrats will fight to keep the fee. New regulations designed to curb pollution from chicken manure spread on fields have become controversial, pitting environmentalists against farmers who find the rules too costly. \Transportation \Maryland raised its gas tax in 2013, and legislative leaders expect a fight over how to spend the new revenue. Hogan has stressed the need to improve roads and bridges, while business groups and others favor mass transit projects already in the pipeline. Hogan has not said whether he'll continue to fund the Red Line in Baltimore or the Purple Line in the Washington suburbs. \Criminal justice \Police accountability is expected to be a major issue in the session. Debate is likely on whether to weaken the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, which police defend as necessary and Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake says makes it hard to discipline officers. State funding for police body cameras could emerge as another area of debate.

301,"
The day after the close of the 2007 General Assembly, Gov. Martin O'Malley gathered yesterday with state leaders to sign 105 bills into law.
\
Sitting between Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, Jr., and House Speaker Michael E. Busch, the governor beamed, focusing on the successes of the session and barely hinting at the storm clouds gathering for January 2008.
\
""We found consensus to advance the common good,"" Mr. O'Malley said. ""We really made some phenomenal progress.""
\
Although the past 90 days produced record amounts of school construction funding, a statewide smoking ban, a living wage for state contractors and tougher car emissions standards, the legislative record was conspicuous for the initiatives left unfinished.
\
The looming deficit? Another session's problem.
\
Legalizing slots? Not right now.
\
Raising taxes? Next year's debate.
\
With the reins of power on the State House's second floor again controlled by the Democratic Party and tough decisions delayed, both branches of the legislature were remarkably free of bitter argument.
\
Even though there were times when rancor surfaced among senators and delegates, such as during budget debates, a truly partisan fire never erupted.
\
""This has been a very strange session,"" said Sen. John Astle, D- Annapolis, a more than 20-year veteran of the General Assembly. ""It is work that has gone very smoothly.""
\
The return of a collegial atmosphere has given the appearance of a light session despite some very important accomplishments, said Mr. Busch, D-Annapolis.
\
""It has been a different tone,"" he said. ""The temperament of some of the members has been a lot more subdued.""
\
For a moment - only a moment - it seemed the leadership was going to confront a looming budget crisis.
\
Next year, senators and delegates will be staring down the barrel of a $1.5-billion structural deficit, which lawmakers have compared to spending $1.12 for every dollar the state collects in revenue.
\
To erase the deficit immediately, every person in Maryland would have to shell out about $268.
\
On Feb. 28, Mr. Miller, D-Calvert, unveiled sweeping initiatives to address that problem. One bill would have authorized slot machines to raise money for education funding and the other would have hiked the gas tax to pay for transportation initiatives - both inevitable necessities, according to Mr. Miller.
\
""There's going to be cuts, there's going to be slots, there's going to be tax increases,"" he said after introducing his proposal. ""It's going to be tough for some people, but they are going to have to suck it up and move forward for the good of the state of Maryland.""
\
That sense of urgency - a burning desire to handle the deficit this year - was not shared by Mr. Busch or Mr. O'Malley.
\
""Until I have a better handle, and all of the newly appointed and approved cabinet heads have a better handle on what their costs and expenditures and reforms are, I think that a lot of legislators have the attitude that they'd rather not have to cast a difficult vote until we can really give them a better sense of what it is that we truly need,"" the governor said the same day Mr. Miller put in his proposals.
\
Ultimately, tax proposals and attempts by both House and Senate Republicans to significantly cut the budget this year were only for discussion purposes, as leadership in both houses deferred the search for new revenues and a deficit solution at Mr. O'Malley's request.
\
""We all certainly would have liked to have things moving quicker,"" said Sen. Ed DeGrange, D-Glen Burnie, who is a member of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee. ""(But) I think that was, reluctantly, what happened.""
\
That directive, however, will only compound the problem in the future because now there is less time to deal with it, said Del. Ron George, R-Arnold.
\
""There was a lot more put off than solved,"" he said. ""The structural problems now become bigger structural problems.""
\
Looking for savings
\
A key component of the governor's patience is the touted StateStat, a government accounting program taken from his days as Baltimore's mayor to measure performance and inefficiency.
\
""We are going to do everything we can to make our government more open and transparent,"" Mr. O'Malley said yesterday at the StateStat bill signing. ""It is going to be our foundation.""
\
Whether that foundation can bear the full weight of fiscal woes is another question.
\
Over the years many special government commissions have already looked for major savings, and the government is in a bind in trying to keep its salaries and benefits competitive with private industry, Mr. Busch said.
\
""I think every governor should look at how his government is run,"" he said. ""But do I have expectations that we're going to find huge waste in government? The answer is no.""
\
But regardless of what is reaped from StateStat, Mr. Busch said the governor was ""wise"" in not rushing into a problem before he truly had a handle on it.
\
""Hopefully, the governor is going to take his interim time and take a look at the tax structure in Maryland,"" Mr. Busch said. ""He has to do that. He has got to come up with different proposals.""
\
The waiting does not mean the governor's office is ignorant of the substantial work ahead, Mr. DeGrange said.
\
""You have to give them a chance to get their feet on the ground,"" he said. ""They know they have heavy lifting to do.""
\
Winners, losers
\
One of the most sweeping changes will come next Feb. 1 when the smoking ban in bars, restaurants and private clubs takes effect. The bill would allow jurisdictions to grant hardship waivers that would expire in 2011.
\
In Anne Arundel County, however, waivers seem unlikely, especially because County Executive John R. Leopold does not support them, and the law allows local governments to enact stricter policies.
\
""I support the toughest possible language,"" Mr. Leopold said earlier this month. ""I would provide a system so my county health officer has the power to deny waivers, as other counties (have).""
\
Other major legislation passed included a living wage for state contractors, who will now have to pay their workers $11.30 an hour in urban counties, including Anne Arundel, and $8.50 an hour in rural counties.
\
The session also saw the passage of stricter admissions standards for vehicle emissions starting with the 2011 model year.
\
But there were two ancillary casualties of the budget problem: one was a sweeping health care initiative sponsored by Del. Peter Hammen, D-Baltimore, and championed by Mr. Busch, to use a $1 dollar per pack increase in the cigarette tax to increase health care coverage.
\
The other, called the ""Green Fund,"" would have taxed new development to pay for improving Maryland's water quality
\
""It would benefit everyone,"" Mr. Busch said of the health care bill. ""It was a disappointment that there wasn't more effort put in.""
\
Mr. Miller, however, was strongly opposed to any new taxes that did not go toward filling the state's financial holes.
\
""(Health care) is a very well-intentioned bill,"" he said. ""(But) we have got a $1.5-billion deficit to struggle to cope with and hopefully we can get that done and move forward to health care some time in the future.""
\
A similar proposal will be brought back, Mr. Busch said.
\
""It is a four-year process, not one,"" he said.
\
One of the biggest accomplishments for the minority party was the passing of ""Jessica's Law.""
\
The bill will make defendants convicted of a first- or second- degree rape or sexual offense and sentenced to a mandatory minimum ineligible for parole for 25 years and between five and 20 years, respectively.
\
Although it faced opposition from committee chairmen, the Republicans worked through grassroots activism and built alliances with moderate Democrats to move it to the floor, said Del. Steve Schuh, R-Gibson Island.
\
""It was a Republican victory and it was a good example of what a minority party can accomplish,"" he said. ""Eventually it could not be stopped.""
\
Local victories
\
The session was also active for the county government, which saw the majority of its legislative wish list become law, including school board reform.
\
""We did very, very well. We had a great relationship,"" said Alan Friedman, the county director of governmental relations. ""(There were) lots of conversations, lots of phone calls. The proof is in the pudding.""
\
The school board bill, pushed by Mr. Leopold, will create an 11- member School Board Nominating Commission to choose nominees for five-year terms on the board beginning July 1. The governor could fill vacancies only from that list of names.
\
After being appointed, a member of the board would have to be approved by the voters at the next general election.
\
The legislation also increases the board to nine members with one more at-large seat and establishes salaries for everyone but the student representative. Under the bill, which goes into effect July 1, the board president would receive $8,000 a year and the other members would get $6,000.
\
""It is really monumental,"" Mr. Busch said. ""It brings us into a modern era of our school board selection.""
\
Even with setbacks such as the failure of a bill to allow a tax on short-term automobile rentals, Mr. Leopold saw the other successful local legislation, such as extending the statute of limitations for critical areas, as outweighing any disappointments.
\
""I'm very pleased that the administration has gotten off to a strong start legislatively,"" he said.
\
The storm ahead
\
The era of good feeling could be short-lived when the General Assembly reconvenes next January to begin tackling the deficit and the search for new revenue sources.
\
Some Republican lawmakers have speculated the waiting game will only make the $1.5 billion hole deeper because of the budget and other initiatives, like the living wage bill, that will drive up costs.
\
""All of us are going to be a lot more on edge,"" Mr. DeGrange said. ""Blood pressure may be rising. We are all going to have to be buckled down.""
\
Although Mr. O'Malley has remained noncommittal on whether a special session will be called to deal with the state's financial problems, Mr. Miller has not been shy about his belief the assembly needs to meet again before next year.
\
""We need a special session,"" he said on Monday. ""We need it very badly.""
\
But Mr. Busch does not believe a special session will be necessary. Those costly interim meetings have to be saved for extraordinary problems like last year's skyrocketing energy rate hikes, he said.
\
""If you have a balanced budget and it is going to remain in balance (until next year), I don't believe you have to come back for a special session,"" Mr. Busch said.
\
The choices for fixing the budget will be limited next year, said Mr. Schuh, who is a member of the House Appropriations Committee. Democrats will likely advocate for more taxes, and the Republicans will work to constrain spending, he said.
\
""It is very understandable that a new governor and a new General Assembly would be inclined to take its time (with the deficit),"" Mr. Schuh said. ""(But) severe tax increases are much more likely.""
\
Near the end of session, Republicans became concerned that some of the legislation being considered __ particularly a bill proposing to extend in-state tuition rights to illegal immigrants __ was leaning the state too far to the left.
\
Even with those differences, however, Mr. Schuh believes the collegiality in Annapolis will survive.
\
""Maryland has a legislature that tilts decidedly to the left. There is clear evidence for that,"" he said. ""But I don't think anybody is interested in getting back to the politics of personalization.""
\
But yesterday, with the three leaders of Maryland government writing their names on legislation, these conversations were left for another time.
\
""At the very least, we were able to disagree in a way that made people proud,"" Mr. O'Malley said. ""We have it within us to be able to tackle these challenges.""
\
Seated in front of television cameras and surrounded by the portraits of past governors, Mr. Miller said the new tenor in Annapolis, and the new executive, are on pace to serve Maryland residents well.
\
""It is a great team,"" he said. ""I think (the session) is going to go down in history as the first in four very good years.""
\
Mr. Busch, who is not known to share every position with the Senate president, echoed the sentiment.
\
""I think it was the start of a new day,"" he said. ""This administration is going to be on course.""

302,"
Thousands of Maryland workers will get an immediate pay raise today as the state-mandated minimum wage jumps from $8 to $8.25.
\
The modest bump is part of a longer path to $10.10 in 2018. The minimum wage increase was approved last session after lively debate with opponents saying it could put too much pressure on businesses and supporters saying families need the extra money to make it in today's economy.
\
Mary Anne O'Donnell, chief administrative officer and assistant director for Catholic Charities, said the increase in minimum wage will move families one step closer to making at least enough money to handle necessary living expenses.
\
As of now, working 40 hours a week only nets about $17,000 a year, even with the raise, she said.
\
""It's really hard to make all the bills in a month,"" O'Donnell said. ""This is a step in the right direction.""
\
The increase in wages is estimated to impact about 53,000 Maryland workers making at or below minimum wage, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2014 data. This makes up about 4 percent of the hourly paid work force.
\
More workers are estimated to benefit from the increase as employers work to maintain wage ladders.
\
While county specific numbers of minimum wage workers weren't available, the Maryland Department of Legislative Services estimated that 245 seasonal employees in Anne Arundel County would be impacted by the wage increases.
\
This is the second time this year the minimum wage has increased. In January the wage jumped from $7.25 an hour to $8, generating an estimated $84 million in increased wages for workers and $55 million in consumer spending, according to Economic Policy Institute research data.
\
Even with potential consumer spending boosts, businesses have raised issue with the wage increase. Owners say it puts financial pressure on their bottom line in a still recovering economy.
\
Those in the food service industry were especially concerned about an increase to minimum wage. Gavin Buckley and Jody Danek run three restaurants in Annapolis.
\
""It's a little bit harder for a business like ours,"" Buckley said. ""We require a big workforce to do what we do. It's not like retail, where one person can run the whole shop. I need 30 people to run a whole shop. .. But everyone needs to make a living wage. We understand that.""
\
Ray Sears runs three Papa John's franchises in Annapolis. A majority of his employees make more than minimum wage, while delivery drivers are paid at that rate when they are not making a delivery.
\
His staff previously planned for the changes by slightly increasing the cost of some pizza toppings and the cost of delivery.
\
""It's time. So many prices have gone up and just the cost of living here, especially in the Annapolis area, that it's time (to increase minimum wage),"" Sears said.""Minimum wage jobs weren't created for somebody trying to head a family.""
\
However, one of the challenges he faces is for employees who make about $9 an hour, previously about $2 above minimum wage. As the minimum wage increases, that person will be viewed as a minimum wage worker.
\
""All of a sudden, they're starting to consider themselves a minimum wage employee as minimum wage goes up,"" Sears said. ""Then it gets tough when you have to start moving everybody up. It creates a big challenge.""
\
These concerns caused the state's minimum wage law to shift before its final passage. The original draft had the $10.10 wage finalized in 2016, but amendments to the bill lengthened the distance from $7.25 to $10.10 to 2018.
\
While supporters swallowed the compromise, some critics thought the state made a mistake when setting the minimum wage on a schedule.
\
Del. Herb McMillan, R-Annapolis, said he supported a modest wage increase, but lamented that it was set to automatically increase.
\
""I'm happy for it to go up this year,"" McMillan said. ""What concerns me is the automatic increases, who knows what will happen to the economy.""
\
""The government shouldn't run on autopilot, someone needs to be flying that plane. That's my view, but then again I'm a pilot.""
\
The minimum wage won't be the only increase to take place Wednesday.
\
Daily parking at Anne Arundel's largest parks will increase from $3 to $6. Daily parking fees at Quiet Waters Park in Annapolis, Fort Smallwood and Downs parks in Pasadena and Kinder Farm Park in Millersville will be affected. Yearly parking permits will remain at $20.
\
The changes were spearheaded by County Executive Steve Schuh administration, who consider the decision to drop the rates under County Executive Laura Neuman last year ""unsustainable.""
\
Fans of summer getaways will be getting a discount if they use the state's toll roads. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge's tolls are reduced from $6 cash to $4 and $5.40 E-Zpass to $2.50 E-Zpass for 2-axle vehicles.
\
The Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge also received reduced rates from $7.20 to $6 for 2-axle vehicles.
\
McMillan said he was glad to see the tolls decreased, but said that was being offset by the increased parking fees.
\
""It is a shame for fees in Anne Arundel parks to go up,"" he said. ""It is sad some of (Hogan's) toll decreases are being offset by the fee increases in Anne Arundel County.""
\
Here are other changes going into effect on Wednesday, which marks the start of the 2016 fiscal year:
\
Stormwater runoff repeal: The bill that was passed by Maryland lawmakers will no longer require counties to tax their residents for runoff. Now Anne Arundel and eight other counties and Baltimore City have to report to the state how they are meeting their runoff reduction goals. Anne Arundel's stormwater fees were not repealed at the local level and residents are still paying.
\
Sex trafficking victims and community college: A new law will allow community colleges to charge in-region fees for sex trafficking victims. This allows the victims to pick and choose their school location, potentially removing them from uncomfortable environments. The legislation was spearheaded by Sen. Bryan Simonaire, R-Pasadena and Del. Meagan Simonaire, R-Pasadena.
\
Gas tax increase: Maryland's drivers will be paying 1.8 cents-per-gallon. The increase is part of the motor fuel gas rate, which was raised from 2 to 3 percent as of today. The Motor Fuel Tax Rate has increased from 23.5 cents per gallon to 32.1 cents since 2013.

303,"Stop tolerating school disruptions\When a student physically attacks a teacher and his or her immediate administrator blames the teacher for the assault, saying that the teacher used a target word or facial expression to provoke the assault by a student, everyone in the community should be appalled (""Attack highlights 'chronic problem,'"" April 13).\When school safety ""experts"" say that teachers need to be taught how to deal with these situations, the community should be outraged.\A teacher's job is to impart knowledge, not to police the actions of unruly, disrespectful, violent students.\As soon as a teacher realizes that a student is being defiant and can no longer be controlled within the classroom, that teacher should be able to get support immediately from a school administrator.\The reasons why this kind of school violence is happening today are way too complex to admit of one simple answer.\Some students come to school without having learned respect for others or without a desire to learn.\Some students know that they can get away with extremely negative behavior because they are aware that their school has a weak administration.\Some students have not learned the correct way to solve problems.\But what about the teachers and students who want to teach and learn?\The school system cannot directly change the home and neighborhood environments that create these uncooperative, violent students.\But it can choose administrators who set clear rules, establish consequences for not following those rules and make every student and teacher aware of the rules.\Karen W. Gronau, Perry Hall\The writer is a retired teacher for the Baltimore County public schools.\As an educator with 34 years of experience in the Baltimore public schools, I applaud the dialogue and suggested solutions from national and local educators, politicians and community leaders regarding the recent outbreaks of school violence in our schools.\But it is critical that while suggestions such as educational summits are being planned, the powers-that-be collectively move quickly to implement solutions to safeguard our teachers and students.\I recommend that we quickly implement 21st-century communications vehicles that will immediately bring safety to our schools.\In this age of wireless technology, every teacher should be equipped with a pager-like alarm that would enable that teacher to be in constant communication with school police and hall monitors in the event of an emergency.\Parents, guardians and students must receive ongoing clear and focused administrative directives outlining expectations for student behavior and the legal consequences of misbehavior.\It is imperative that central office communications liaisons be assigned to schools to educate and assist school personnel in crisis management.\Overall, the driving force in fixing violent mayhem in our schools is the development and implementation of an inclusive communications process among teachers, students, parents, union officials, school personnel, the central office and community stakeholders.\Sharon Blake, Baltimore\The writer is a teacher in the Baltimore schools and a former president of the Baltimore Teachers Union.\It is so appalling to read about the violence in our schools. It should make us look deeply into this serious problem and take the necessary steps to stop it (""Attack highlights 'chronic problem,'"" April 13).\The first thing we need to do is find a way to enforce a zero tolerance policy and do so quickly.\Going to school is a privilege, and if a child is going to continually act in a disruptive way, we need to get that child out of school and into a job or the military service.\When I was a child growing up in the 1950s, it would have been unthinkable for me to talk back to a teacher, let alone strike one. I could imagine the police coming to the school and taking me to jail and my parents, as well as the whole community, being shocked at such behavior.\I would have been punished and ashamed of what I had done. But today, such violence seems instead to be glorified and put on YouTube. That is absolutely sick.\When is enough enough?\We all need to take responsibility and do our part to stop the violence - parents, grandparents, legislators, teachers, principals and the whole community.\Perhaps we need to think about going back to those good old days of respect and discipline and about how to get back to those times and get there fast.\Lynn Pakulla, Ellicott City\Wind decision protects posterity\Gov. Martin O'Malley's recent announcement of his decision to protect Maryland's public lands from industrial wind development came from the heart (""Wind farms to be barred,"" April 12).\Standing before a breathtaking early spring view of the Monroe Run vista and addressing about 200 Garrett Countians, the governor spoke eloquently about his stewardship obligations for passing down such natural beauty to our posterity - our children and our children's children.\He also commended the articulate passion of so many Western Marylanders for helping him to understand why this issue is so important here, and how intimately tied it is to our quality of life.\Mr. O'Malley's decision might even be considered courageous in light of his belief that wind technology should be part of the mix that will drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and end our dependence on foreign oil.\But given the thermal implications involved in balancing wind's volatility, among other factors, the technology can at best offset relatively minuscule levels of carbon emissions.\Mr. O'Malley's rationale for protecting our public lands should be instructive to our local political leaders, who have stated they believe the entirety of Garrett County should be conserved as a natural heritage resource.\Those politicians are right.\And the oafish presence of ineffectual commercial wind installations is incompatible with that idea.\Jon Boone, Oakland\The writer has testified before the Maryland Public Service Commission against wind power projects.\Md. lags behind on clean energy\Gov. Martin O'Malley's decision not to allow wind power generation in state forests is a shortsighted mistake (""Wind farms to be barred,"" April 12).\To date, Maryland has zero wind power capacity.\Other states are doing much more; U.S. wind power capacity surged 45 percent last year.\And other countries are way ahead of the United States on wind power. Denmark gets 20 percent of its electric power from the wind; Germany gets more than 9 percent.\As an engineer, I personally think current wind turbines are rather attractive; they certainly are more pleasing to the eye than the gas-guzzling Hummers in our neighbors' driveways.\Placing wind turbines along the ridge lines in our forest areas would not require clearing much more of the forests than logging roads involve.\And if global warming isn't stemmed, there won't be any forests left to enjoy.\Jim Hendry, Catonsville\'Hummer holiday' wrong fuel policy\Let's consider who will benefit more from Sen.

\
Kadyja Green lives near Fort George G. Meade. She makes minimum wage working at Love Ones, a lingerie store. While she likes the work and meets interesting people, she said the 25-cent increase isn't going to change her life.
\
She still struggles to make it month to month as she works nights and cares for her 2-year-old daughter. While she wants to get paid more, she finds it hard to make time for training or affording college to find better- paying work.
\
""It should be going up faster,"" Green said. ""It is impossible to live off minimum wage.""
\

""The government shouldn't run on autopilot; someone needs to be flying that plane. That's my view, but then again I'm a pilot.""
\
The minimum wage won't be the only increase to take effect today.
\
Daily parking at Anne Arundel's largest parks will increase from $3 to $6. Daily parking fees at Quiet Waters Park in Annapolis, Fort Smallwood and Downs parks in Pasadena, and Kinder Farm Park in Millersville will be affected. Yearly parking permits will remain at $20.
\
The changes were spearheaded by County Executive Steve Schuh's administration, which considered the decision to drop the rates under County Executive Laura Neuman last year ""unsustainable.""
\
Fans of summer getaways will be getting a discount if they use the state's toll roads. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge's tolls are reduced from $6 cash to $4 and $5.40 E-ZPass to $2.50 E-ZPass for two-axle vehicles.
\
The Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge, which carries Route 40 over the Susquehanna River in Harford County, also has reduced rates, from $7.20 to $6 for two-axle vehicles.
\
McMillan said he was glad to see the tolls decreased but added this was being offset by the increased parking fees.
\
""It is a shame for fees in Anne Arundel parks to go up,"" he said. ""It is sad some of (Hogan's) toll decreases are being offset by the fee increases in Anne Arundel County.""
\
Here are other changes going into effect today, which marks the start of the 2016 fiscal year:
\
Stormwater runoff repeal: The bill that was passed by Maryland lawmakers will no longer require counties to tax their residents for runoff control. Now Anne Arundel and eight other counties, as well as Baltimore City, have to report to the state how they are meeting their runoff reduction goals. Anne Arundel's stormwater fees were not repealed at the local level, and residents are still paying.
\
Sex trafficking victims and community college: A new law will allow community colleges to charge in-region fees for sex trafficking victims. This allows the victims to pick and choose their school location, potentially removing them from uncomfortable environments. The legislation was spearheaded by Sen. Bryan Simonaire and Del. Meagan Simonaire, both R-Pasadena.
\
Gas tax increase: Maryland's drivers will be paying 1.8 cents more per gallon. The increase is part of the motor fuel gas rate, which was raised from 2 to 3 percent as of today. The tax has increased from 23.5 cents per gallon to 32.1 cents since 2013.

"
306,"Americans feeling the pain of soaring energy costs deserve more from their leaders. Politicians, including presidential candidates, should stop pandering with proposals designed only to win votes and offer comprehensive strategies to strengthen our economy and confront the energy challenge.\Amazingly, investment tax credits for America's fledgling solar and wind power industries will expire this December, unless Congress ends a futile debate in which Republicans are resisting Democrats' proposals to pay for the relief with cuts in oil industry tax credits. The solar and wind credits would help ensure that these businesses remain profitable if oil prices should suddenly drop.\In the late 1990s America was the leader in solar energy, producing an estimated 40 percent of global output. Now the United States makes less than 8 percent. BP Solar, a subsidiary of the oil company, recently completed a $25 million expansion, adding more than 100 jobs at its Frederick plant. But now the company has begun production of two new solar cell manufacturing plants abroad - one at its European headquarters in Madrid, and a second in Bangalore, India.\American homes consume extraordinary quantities of energy, and much more could be done to cut the waste. Next year, Montgomery County will require new houses there to meet national Energy Star conservation standards. These homes will use up to 30 percent less energy with less than 2 percent higher construction costs, county officials estimate.\Other energy solutions aren't complicated. Among them: aggressive goals for car and truck fuel economy, generous funding of alternative energy research and promoting policies that would encourage people to drive less, not more.\Proposals that keep cars on the road more, like the summer gas tax holiday proposed by Sens. John McCain and Hillary Clinton, should be dismissed. Investing in conservation and alternative energy will mean more jobs and a healthier environment, and will slow the flow of dollars abroad that fuel our oil addiction."
307,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."
308,"The car industry's embrace of the automobile mileage standards announced yesterday by President Barack Obama is a sure sign of just how overdue they were.\California was already moving in the direction of cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars - with states like Maryland committed to follow. There was also a distinct possibility that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency might clamp down further as part of an effort to address the growing threat posed by greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.\Can Detroit meet the 35.5-miles-per-gallon corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard by 2016, a full four years earlier than envisioned just two years ago? The answer appears to be yes. It just required the proper motivation, and a solid uniform national standard (that gets California and the EPA off their back) appears to be just the kind of kick in the rear fender the industry needs.\But there's still a measure of uncertainty in the president's plan: Consumers might not want these fuel-efficient cars if gas prices remain where they are today.\A plug-in electric commuter car is a lot more attractive when gas is selling for $4 a gallon then at the current $2.30. Even the White House's estimate that the added cost of $1,300 per vehicle can be recovered in three years of driving is based on much higher gas prices.\Those prices are likely to return within seven years, but why wait for big corporations and foreign producers to pocket the inevitable windfall? President Obama needs to gradually raise the gas tax to make up the difference beginning next year to ensure car buyers are properly motivated.\And what would Washington do with the money? Return it right back to consumers in the form of a lower personal income tax rate or perhaps a rebate on new car purchases as a way to stimulate the economy. With high gas prices, automakers would be scrambling to meet consumer demand for energy-efficient vehicles.\On the other hand, a policy that requires fuel efficiency but doesn't ensure higher energy prices could ultimately prove counterproductive if, for instance, it causes people to drive more. That would not only harm the environment, but it would maintain the nation's costly dependence on foreign producers.\Government regulations have their value, but ensuring higher gas prices produces a market-based solution that in the long term is bound to be more effective. It's also a win-win for consumers who shouldn't mind paying twice as much at the pump for a car that uses half as much gas. The bonus? Perhaps the world is spared the most disastrous effects of climate change and rising sea levels."
309,"Consumer frustration over high gasoline prices has apparently been judged blind-rage-inducing enough to trot out the usual discredited solution, domestic oil drilling. President Bush recently reiterated his desire to drill just about everywhere from Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the Gulf of Mexico as a way to offer consumers relief at the pump.\Sen. John McCain, whose energy credentials were already suspect with his earlier endorsement of a counterproductive (at least as a solution to gas prices) summer-long gas tax holiday, joined the fray last week. He'd like to see offshore derricks ringing the coastline as well and would even dangle financial incentives to encourage states to lift their own bans on coastal exploration.\Allowing oil companies to drill within 200 miles of the U.S. shoreline would certainly have an impact - but only on the environment and producer profits. Prices wouldn't go down. In global terms, North America doesn't have the reserves to do that.\The estimated 75 billion barrels of oil lying underneath the undisturbed tundra in ANWR, for instance, may sound like a lot, but in terms of oil demand it really isn't. The Energy Information Administration estimates that it might reduce gasoline prices by as much as 5 cents a gallon by 2027.\States like Florida may be tempted by the lure of revenue from new offshore leases, but the Sunshine State is gambling with a multibillion-dollar tourism industry that depends greatly on Atlantic and Gulf coast beaches that are not befouled by oil spills.\Sadly, there's evidence that Americans may be susceptible to this siren song. A recent Gallup poll suggested that a majority favor opening up new territories to drilling - and an apparent misunderstanding of the facts has given the oil industry an opening.\The real answer to the nation's energy woes would involve greater conservation, higher fuel efficiency standards and the development of renewable alternatives. But even that wouldn't lead to an immediate and substantial downturn in gasoline prices - and that's a painful reality most pols don't care to discuss.\America can't drill its way out of $4-a-gallon gasoline, but like Bruce Banner's alter ego on a rampage, indiscriminate drilling could cause a lot of destruction while trying."
310," Safety project delayed\ ANNAPOLIS -- Construction of the Public Safety Training Center, a facility planned for Sykesville, will be delayed to help resolve the state's current budget deficit.\ The 1991 budget balancing act approved Monday by the Legislature includes a $13 million transfer from the center's specially created fund to the general treasury.\ The facility would be a training center for state and local police officers and prison personnel.\ ANNAPOLIS\ Elliott rejects forest bill\ ANNAPOLIS -- Delegate Donald B. Elliott, R-Carroll, Howard, voted in committee against a bill that would require developers to replace trees they cut down for construction and plant trees on some sites that weren't initially forested.\ The forest conservation bill, sponsored by the Schaefer administration, passed the House Environmental Matters Committee last week by a 19-4 vote. Delegate Lawrence A. LaMotte, D-Carroll, Baltimore, voted for the bill.\ The bill was an amended version of the one that passed the Senate and will be considered by the full House this week. It is intended to prevent a net loss of forest in Maryland by retaining existing forests and creating new ones in areas that have previously been vacant or deforested by past land-use practices.\ Elliott said he is concerned the bill would ""take away property rights of people"" who want to develop land. He said that such programs should be left to regional governments to develop, rather than imposed by the state. He added that the tree planting requirements could be cost-prohibitive to developers and could drive up the price of housing.\ LaMotte said the legislature has the responsibility to protect the environment.\ The Maryland Office of Planning reports that the state has lost about 71,000 acres of forest in the last five years, about half the amount of land that has been developed during that same period.\ ANNAPOLIS\ DOT taxes opposed\ ANNAPOLIS -- Carroll's two senators voted against proposed motor vehicle registration and drivers license fee increases that could generate an estimated $42 million next year.\ The increases would allow the state Department of Transportation to retain some federal aid and proceed with planned road construction projects.\ The measure passed the Senate, 26-21, and now moves to the House, where its fate is uncertain. The Senate refused to included a 5 percent increase in the gas tax proposed by the governor.\ DOT officials say the agency has a $600 million deficit in its five-year capital program. No money is available for new road construction in fiscal 1992 unless the Legislature approves some revenue raising measures, they say.\ DOT outlined last week $18.8 million in Carroll road expansion and maintenance projects that are among the $1.2 billion in projects that could be put on hold.\ Sen. Charles H. Smelser, D-Carroll, Frederick, Howard, said he believed DOT's projections were overly grim. Sen. Larry E. Haines, R-Carroll, Baltimore, also voted against the measure.\ ANNAPOLIS"
311,"
The debate in Annapolis has degenerated from desperation to absurdity. Faced with news that the state confronts another $150 million budget deficit this year, politicians are considering firing 2,000 more government workers, reducing salaries, giving employees time off off without pay and making even deeper cuts in the money that goes to already teetering local governments.
\
Sure there are whispers among members of the General Assembly about adding an extra 1 percent to the sales tax, or maybe tacking a couple of pennies onto the gas tax. But more powerful is the political pressure to do nothing but cut. And then cut some more. That, incumbents say, is the mandate voters handed them last November. Though there is room for debate over what, precisely, voters wanted when they threw out a slew of incumbents last fall, this much is clear: The mandate was issued before the bottom fell out of the state's economy.
\
Certainly, there was some fat in the bureaucracies of state and local government. But Maryland officials have had to slash $1 billion from the budget since last fall, and the impact of the last round of cuts, to plug a $450 million hole, has not yet been felt. In every jurisdiction, state aid is being slashed; police and fire budgets will be hit as well as money for education, drug treatment, road repair. Many government employees have been forced to take substantial pay cuts; thousands could be laid off statewide before this is over. And that merely feeds the budget problem: More than 320,000 Marylanders are now receiving food stamps, for example, and a burgeoning number qualify for medical assistance and welfare, all of which means even more red ink.
\
Of course Maryland can sustain another round of cuts in the name of less government. But what will we have if it does? Putting off road and bridge repair or cutting money for schools, social services, police and fire protection, health and drug-treatment programs -- to name just a few -- will not make needs go away. It will only reduce the level of service and cost taxpayers more down the road when existing problems, exacerbated by neglect, can no longer be ignored.
\
""No new taxes"" has become the national mantra. But if this is the course Marylanders choose, we must all be prepared to reduce our expectations of what government can do, and to adjust to an environment in which the programs and services on which many people now rely will be either replaced by a thousand points of lights or simply burn out. With 8 cents of every tax dime committed to mandated programs, and with the state facing another $700 million deficit for the fiscal year that starts in July, the choice is critical, and it must be made soon.
"
312," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen is too savvy in the ways of Washington to loft a big balloon without some assurance he has President Clinton's support. So when he says a broad-based energy tax would raise revenues, help the environment and reduce the nation's dependence on imported oil from unstable regions, he is softening up citizens for the undefined ""sacrifice"" Mr. Clinton mentioned in his inaugural address.\ If more taxes must come, this will do as good as most. If it finds favor, it could eventually lead the way to more general taxes on consumption -- sales or value-added or higher levies on spent income -- that would reduce the Treasury's reliance on regular income taxes as its principal source of revenue. The major industrialized countries collect about 30 percent of their revenues from consumption taxes, almost double the 17 percent share of total tax revenues collected by federal, state and local governments in the U.S.\ Many economists have long been critical of the tax mix in this country because it encourages spending rather than savings and thus limits the amount of capital available for investment and growth. But this assumes the Clinton administration is prepared to hold down federal spending. So far the evidence is skimpy. Voters may merely have exchanged a borrow-and-spend administration for a tax-and-spend administration.\ What makes a broad-based energy tax preferable to a boost in gasoline taxes or an excise tax on imported oil is that it comes closest to meeting the test of fairness. It would not penalize states with wide-open spaces, as a gas tax would, or unduly hurt urbanized coastal regions where there is a heavy reliance on imported heating oils.\ If the president succeeds in tilting the tax system burden from income to consumption, he should try to exclude essentials and offer some form of compensation to lower- and middle-income groups. After all, these groups were promised a tax break by Candidate Clinton and are likely to get a tax hike instead. The important thing is to persevere with intelligent tax reform. This country is so wedded to the income tax that it is falling more and more out of sync with other industrialized countries just when increased international flows of goods and capital require the opposite."
313," This week's hastily arranged and protester-laden press conference by Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. announcing federal approval of the Intercounty Connector was a fitting milestone for a project that's been plagued by controversy. Several generations of Montgomery County leaders have been talking about developing an east-west commuter corridor. Now, it seems to be just a matter of months before construction begins.\ That's good news, right? So why does it all seem a bit anticlimactic?\ Perhaps it's because the criticisms raised by protesters like those at Tuesday's announcement are not without merit. By any measure, the ICC is going to be costly. Most recent estimates peg it at $2.4 billion, making it Maryland's most expensive public works project. Its financing will require not only toll collection (of up to $1,500 per year for a daily, rush-hour commuter) but also a willingness to issue restrictive bonds that will require the state to devote a big share of Maryland's future federal highway aid toward repayment. It's been done in other states but not usually so much for a single project or for so large an amount.\ Such a financing plan defers costs (and the traditional consequence - higher gas tax or highway user fees) into the future. But what does it mean for Maryland's transportation plans in the years to come? Are we committing too much of our limited resources to highway construction when we should be investing in more energy- efficient transit modes? That question was answered several years ago when Mr. Ehrlich first pledged his support for the ICC. But gas prices of $3 a gallon and more put the question in quite a different context today.\ Marylanders have also become more skeptical in recent years about growth. The ICC will foster development in Montgomery County, where residents have gotten so disenchanted with poorly regulated growth that the county's Planning Board chairman had to resign. And the effects of a six-lane highway between Interstate 270 and the I-95 corridor will require some sacrifice of private homes and the environment - even with the mitigation state officials have promised.\ Despite the threat of a last-minute court challenge, the ICC appears to be a sure thing with strong backing from business interests (and all the major candidates for governor). The opportunity to bring some of Montgomery County's well-paid jobs to Prince George's County and the rest of Central Maryland is too attractive to be ignored. But its budget-straining cost, the state's failure to adequately support transit alternatives and the sacrifices the project will require make it far less enticing an enterprise than it seemed just a few years ago."
314,"For Charles Lollar, the best thing the next governor of Maryland can do is cut taxes to make the state friendly for businesses and promote job growth.\Nearly everything else is secondary to the Charles County businessman and Marine reservist who is running in the GOP primary for governor, besides a major reorganization of the state's executive branch that he contends will make state government more efficient. The tea party Republican says the large number of revenue hikes in recent years present too great a threat to the health of the state.\""When someone comes into a hospital, into a trauma center, after a bad accident, let's stop the main bleeding first and let's take care of everything else second,"" Lollar said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.\The Charles County businessman isn't afraid to take on a tough campaign challenge. In 2010, Lollar ran against Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Lollar lost with 35 percent of the vote to 64 percent for Hoyer. Undeterred, he's back on the campaign trail running to be Maryland's chief executive, on the warpath against increases in taxes, tolls and fees.\Lollar said he regularly hears from college students while campaigning who tell him there aren't enough jobs in Maryland.\""Well, there should be, especially here in Maryland, because for all practical purposes this is one of the best places in the country to start a business if we would just change the economic environment so we can stop pushing businesses out the door and bring them back in,"" Lollar told a class of students last week at Huntingtown High School in Calvert County.\He also supports allowing hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, in western Maryland.\""The natural gas industry in western Maryland would turn it around,"" Lollar said, referring to the economy.\Fracking is a technique to extract oil and gas from rock by injecting high-pressure mixtures of water, sand or gravel and chemicals into the ground. Fracking has been delayed in the state for study.\Lollar wants to phase out the state's income tax during five years. He says he believes it can be done without serious cuts to government services, mostly by cutting waste in state government.\Lollar also wants to cut the state's corporate income tax from 8.25 percent to 4.25 percent. Lollar said he would work to eliminate stormwater management fees, which have been dubbed the ""rain tax"" by opponents. Lollar also is calling for an end to estate and inheritance taxes. A gas tax approved last year by Maryland lawmakers also is a target.\Three other candidates who are running in the GOP primary also are campaigning on proposals to cut taxes. Harford County Executive David Craig also wants to phase out the state's income tax. Delegate Ron George wants a 10 percent income tax cut and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 8.25 percent to 6.25 percent. Larry Hogan also is calling for tax cuts.\The primary is set for June 24."
315,"People are driving less, a lot less. That's hardly shocking given high gasoline prices and the downturn in the economy, and not entirely bad. Lowered consumption and greater fuel efficiency can only help the environment and loosen, if perhaps only slightly, the nation's dependence on foreign oil. But the trend is also disastrous for the financing of the nation's transportation infrastructure.\At a time when the U.S. should be investing more in its deteriorating roads and bridges, the gasoline-tax-financed highway trust fund is oversubscribed and teetering on bankruptcy. In Maryland, the state transportation trust fund's projected revenues may be off by as much as 5 percent to 10 percent. Officials are still calculating exactly what this might mean over the next six years, but it's safe to assume that significant highway and transit spending cuts will have to be made.\A number of factors have made the situation worse, including a record drop in car sales (vehicle titling taxes are second only to the gas tax as the largest source of revenue to the trust fund) and a doubling in the cost of asphalt over the past year.\But if the situation in Maryland is alarming, the federal government's predicament is disastrous. The federal trust fund was in trouble before the energy crisis. The $8 billion general fund infusion approved last week by the House represents, at best, a temporary Band-Aid.\This Friday marks the one-year anniversary of the collapse of the Interstate 35-W bridge in Minneapolis. That terrible event underscored the severity of the nation's infrastructure needs - by the federal government's own reporting, more than one-quarter of bridges are structurally deficient or obsolete. But Congress and the White House have failed to take the needed actions to prevent more such tragedies.\Had government, federal and local, had the foresight to raise gas taxes years ago, when motorists needed to be weaned from their guzzlers, the country's transportation system - and our oil-addicted economy - might be in far better shape today. What's needed now is a new and reliable source of revenue and a commitment to address the $495 billion backlog of deferred road and bridge maintenance and repairs and to improve and expand public transit, including trains, subways, light rail and clean buses.\Such an enhanced public works agenda would no doubt provide a needed boost for the economy in the near term. But more important, it would move America toward a transportation system that is cleaner, faster and cheaper than the aging and crowded one that exists now."
316,"Grapevine is a sampling of comments and observations on a variety of timely topics submitted by readers of The Daily Times.\Blame Democrats\I am not a Republican or a Democrat; I vote on the issues. I know that two years ago, gas prices were below $2, and that year's election was when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives. Look at the state our nation is in now. Sure -- it's easy to blame the president, but we need to look at what really occurred two years ago. Keep in mind -- John McCain was wanting to waive the gas tax from Memorial Day to Labor Day this year, but Democrats quickly shot that down.\Harris's values\If all you care about is money and you don't care about flushing the bay and the rest of our environment down the toilet, then vote for Andy Harris; he will be a great choice for your values.\Trickle-down economics\Trickle-down economics and deregulation are two Republican Party initiatives since the 1980s that have resulted in a huge transfer of wealth to the rich. This opened the chickenhouse doors to let in the fox. Neither initiative has helped the middle class. The first increased our tax burden; the second created an atmosphere that allowed greed to permeate financial institutions, in turn causing the crisis the country is dealing with now.\Mum's the word?\I wonder why there is never anything reported about certain areas in Salisbury. Is it that the mayor is keeping things quiet before the elections in April? I know of several hot spots inside the city limits that are never reported on by The Daily Times, like on Church Street, where trash blows down the streets, and the Doverdale playground area, which was a waste of money to fix, just so area kids could tear it up again.\Wicomico's budget\The county executive wants to take away the revenue cap. Yet pay raises are not to be found now for years in Wicomico County. The county was robbed of $400,000 by not paying attention to its affairs with Pubic Works. And the County Council wants to eliminate a Wicomico County Liquor Board that brings in about $200,000 more than the council's hand-picked task force determined it could raise if liquor sales were privatized, thus raising taxes. I've no money left now. Forget eliminating the cap.\Chastisement is coming\I just finished studying the Old Testament. Over and over again, God chastised the Hebrews when they let pagan societies corrupt them to the extent that they, too, would sacrifice their own children. To date, we've sacrificed more than 40 million children with ""freedom of choice,"" and we're leaning toward the candidate who wants to ensure it continues. I see chastisement in our near future."
317," YOUR EDITORIAL concerning the state's capital program for transportation projects (""State's transportation hush money,"" Feb. 5) pointed out that the plan will provide significant improvements throughout Maryland. I would like to clarify several aspects.\ The $5.4 billion, six-year capital program implements Gov. Parris Glendening's vision for transportation in relation to broader state goals, specifically: preserving our excellent infrastructure; supporting economic development; revitalizing our existing communities; and being stewards of our environment.\ Approximately half of the capital program is dedicated to maintaining our highways, bridges, tunnels, port channels, buses and rail cars. The remainder invests in our flourishing airport and port, and funds the advancement or completion of highway and transit projects statewide.\ The $48 million for Redskins stadium infrastructure improvements was added without affecting any existing project commitments.\ Since stadium discussions had been ongoing for quite some time, the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) had anticipated construction of these important access improvements.\ Such improvements for a facility of this magnitude are clearly a necessity. Additionally, the roadways will be used by motorists year round.\ I disagree with your statement that Maryland lacks a long-term vision for mass transit.\ Our annual Maryland Transportation Plan provides a vision and policy framework for the future of mass transit. The capital program makes substantial progress in achieving the vision.\ In addition to MARC station improvements in the Baltimore and Washington metropolitan areas; the MARC extension to Frederick; light rail extensions to Hunt Valley, Penn Station and BWI airport; the Metrorail extensions to Glenmont and Branch Avenue; and new park and ride services, the program funds our plan to take transit into a new century of services amid declines in federal funding and changing ridership demographics.\ We are examining transit center development, new corridors for fixed rail service and options for more direct connections between light rail and Metro.\ In fiscal year 1997, we've funded a more detailed 25-year transit plan that will consider demographic and economic projections, land development policies and transit demand forecasts.\ We are doing whatever is necessary to contain costs and be more innovative in financing projects. As a matter of fact, as announced by Governor Glendening, the $511 million recently added to the capital program was accomplished without a gas tax increase primarily through MDOT's efforts to squeeze efficiencies from our operating budget.\ We will continue to seek ways to turn savings back into transportation projects for citizens throughout Maryland.\ David L. Winstead\ Linthicum\ The writer is transportation secretary of Maryland."
318,"
Gov. Martin O'Malley received 21 transition reports on state agencies yesterday designed to help guide the new administration and improve departments that have been highly troubled in recent years - such as corrections and juvenile services.
\
The reports have been in the works for more than a month and consist of more than 1,000 pages.
\
Mr. O'Malley, speaking at a news conference, described the reports as ""our business plan"" for at least the next six months and ""a reference document"" for his term. The governor said information in the reports will be used in his StateStat program, a new statistics-based accountability initiative requiring regular reviews of government effectiveness.
\
Mr. O'Malley, a Democrat, said in the next 45 days department heads ""will evaluate the recommendations and figure out which ones we're moving forward on, which ones we're moving forward on possibly later - which ones we choose not to move forward on.""
\
The reports made recommendations on a wide range of policy areas including agriculture, education, the state's jails, the environment, economic development, transportation, health, human resources, energy and elections.
\
The report on public safety, corrections and the state police described the state's prisons as being in a ""crisis"" and recommended technological improvements to increase safety.
\
""The team concludes that the shortest distance from the current safety crisis to improved safety and security is effective deployment of technology and human resources,"" the report concluded.
\
That includes the launch of CorrectionStat - the name given to the governor's new accountability initiative focusing on corrections. Corrections will be one of the first agencies to begin holding regular meetings to review how well its meeting new goals.
\
The report on the state's juvenile services department described the agency as ""dangerously dysfunctional, trapped in a cycle of reacting to scandals and deferring proactive reforms."" The report concluded that the agency needs to have more local control, because field and facility staff have little input into major agency decisions.
\
John Coale, an attorney who chaired the group that put the juvenile services report together, said 80 to 85 percent of the youths held in juvenile justice facilities were there for fairly minor offenses and clumped together with violent youth offenders. He said the group is recommending separating them from more violent youths.
\
Don Fry, president of the Greater Baltimore Committee who worked on the transportation report, said transportation funding will be one of the most significant economic development issues over the next decade.
\
One recommendation in that report, he said, was to find an ""inflation-sensitive"" funding mechanism to pay for transportation projects, instead of relying on the state's gas tax, which have not been raised since 1992.
"
319,"
As an attorney, I spend my days carefully picking words to further the goals and needs of my clients. This requires advocacy, sometimes finesse and compromise. Utilizing previous cases and law to effectuate desired outcomes for clients is the goal of an effective advocate. The words and language I rely upon, the purpose and goal of the underlying cause, creep up and give me that ""ah-ha"" moment when I am keenly aware that my legal and legislative worlds have collided. The ability to combine the creation of law and apply and advocate using the same law comes full circle. My prior service on the County Council working with General Assembly members and state agencies resolving issues and the relationships built over several years, working together for our constituency, have been beneficial to my representing District 33, the position which I ask voters to allow me to continue.
\
I listened carefully to the speeches of the many individuals seeking to represent District 33. I am fascinated with the newest of candidates who promise to single-handedly remove, repeal, fund or provide relief - guaranteed! I remember as a brand-new candidate for council thinking exactly as they do. After all, we put on the Superman cape and promise to be everything to everyone, right? If only it were that easy.
\
The selection of your representatives should be based on, I believe, some very simple criteria. Do you find them trustworthy? What are they promising? Hard work? Constituent service? Access to ""important people""? Have they been involved in the community? Have they done what they say they will do in prior activities? Will they represent your views on the issues most important to you? In answering these questions, I hope you find that I have fulfilled my role and my promises to serve you, the citizens of District 33.

As your delegate, I have been given the honor to represent your views and be your voice in Annapolis and have worked hard to ensure that your voice is heard. Constituents know that I am a hard worker, a good listener. I research the issues, evaluate possible solutions and make choices based on people, not politics. I have always served with honor, integrity and ethics.
\
As I go door to door, the most important issues raised by voters are: taxes, out of control spending and burdensome regulations. I voted against the rain tax and the gas tax and against $7.7 billion of increased state spending, and rejected the idea of increasing budgets as the only way to solve problems. I stood up against leadership when they tried to hide elected officials' pay raises and I voted against the raises and the process that hid them. I argued on the House floor that our citizens deserve and demand transparency. At your request, I voted for lower taxes, education funding and protecting your rights. I supported less government regulation and a better environment for businesses and families.
\
When asked where I stand, my record reflects the person I am, the person I represented myself to be when I first asked for your vote. I am a mother of a terrific freshman in college, married 26 years to my husband (a lieutenant in the Anne Arundel County Fire Department). I am an attorney, a mediator and a community member. I am the cheerleader on the sidelines of athletic events and a reader on Dr. Seuss day. Most of all, I am just like you: a community member who works hard with the community she loves to make it a better place for our families, our businesses and our friends. The only difference between us is that you will sometimes also see me on the street corner with a campaign sign, seeking your vote. But you will always see me working with you and for you in Annapolis.

320,"Despite some modest help from the federal stimulus plan, times are tough for public transportation. Across the country, agencies are seeing ridership and government funding drop even as they reduce services and raise fares to keep their budgets balanced.\Some of this is necessary to deal with the inevitable hardships of recession. No public service is immune from economic realities. Running mostly empty buses on little-patronized routes or expecting taxpayers to fully bear the operating costs of transit in Baltimore or anywhere else is not possible politically and probably not smart economically.\But there needs to be a limit on how much public transportation can be squeezed. While belt-tightening is appropriate in the short term, it's easy to lose sight of the long-term need to grow transit ridership and invest far more in buses, trains and other forms of public transportation than is done today.\That dilemma was highlighted last week when Maryland Transportation Secretary Beverly Swaim-Staley was questioned by a General Assembly committee over the Maryland Transit Administration's requested $468 million budget, which a legislative analyst deemed too small to keep up with rising costs.\Where Republicans stand on this issue was made clear when GOP legislators recommended cutting the MTA budget much further and raising fares. Many rural lawmakers would happily see urban transit systems dry up and blow away. The common cry from the transit doubters is the same today as it's always been: Why can't the MTA operate as a business?\The problem with this thinking is that it recognizes the costs of transit services but not their value. The MTA's fare box recovery rate may be hovering around 30 percent, but that doesn't mean it's inefficient. Roads are heavily subsidized by tax dollars, too, as is every form of transportation, yet nobody talks of the state highway or airport ""business model.""\Transit connects people to jobs and gets them off government subsidies. It reduces traffic congestion and the need to build massively expensive new highways. It uses energy more efficiently, causes fewer pollutants to be spewed into the environment and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.\Why spend taxpayers' money on transit? Ultimately, for only one reason: because it's in their interests.\If the MTA can be more efficient, we're all for it. Still, the question the MTA ought to be asking itself is this: What can we do to attract more customers?\If the business model has anything to teach government, it's the need to put the interests of your customers (in this case, riders) first. Few profit from a strategy that seeks only to raise prices and diminish product - at least not companies that want to stay in business long.\The real crisis for Maryland transportation is the failure of government leaders to put forth a plan to finance the state's future transportation needs. Proposals in Annapolis to raise the gas tax are considered DOA. Alternatives are in short supply.\Until that changes, Maryland won't have much choice but to watch ridership and transit services erode like so many leftover piles of snow. But instead of cold water, all that will remain is gridlock, pollution, poverty, unemployment and a lot of regret.\Readers respond\The most successful places on the planet have the best transit. Why mess with that formula?\Jed\You fail to mention the inherent danger of taking mass transit in this crime ridden city.\Jay"
321," TODAY, AS the Maryland General Assembly convenes for its annual 90-day session, lawmakers can take comfort in the familiar surroundings of cheery Colonial Annapolis. Less charmingly, they'll confront another familiar scene: a gaping budget deficit and a standoff over slot machines.\ Little has changed since the last time the Assembly met, including the debilitating political animus that continues to fester within the Annapolis political triumvirate of Republican Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. and Democratic leaders Michael E. Busch and Thomas V. Mike Miller.\ On paper, Maryland's budget deficit is not as bad as the shortfalls facing other states. The gap for next year is about $700 million, less than 4 percent of a $22 billion state budget. Lawmakers have traditionally approached looming deficits (in the early 1990s, for instance) through a combination of budget cuts and tax increases.\ But the problems seem more intractable than ever this year, tied to Mr. Ehrlich's dogged quest for slot machines and uncertainty over the state's long-term commitment to public education, the $1.3 billion Thornton Plan. Both efforts are at a crossroads, and in the governor's mind, they are linked. Solving the state's fiscal puzzle now requires more than budget-balancing; it demands the untangling of a Gordian knot of good and bad public policy.\ Last year, this was a new legislature dealing with a new governor. Inexperience can no longer be an excuse. This Assembly will be judged on whether it finds a long-term solution to the state's financial woes, preserves vital education aid, and just says no to expanded gambling. Such a course is difficult, yes, but not impossible. A few stubborn, uncommunicative politicians must not stand in the way.\ The legislature's work won't stop there, of course. There are dozens of other critical issues facing lawmakers in Annapolis that run the gamut from cleaning up sewage plants to financing highway construction and more fairly taxing corporations. Here is a checklist of the most important items on the agenda:\ Education - Preserve full funding for the Thornton Plan, a particularly critical need for Baltimore and other financially ailing subdivisions. Also hold harmless aid to higher education, an area hit hard by budget cuts last year, and explore capping future tuition increases.\ Transportation - Replenish the state's bare highway and transit cupboard with an increase in titling fees and a nickel on the gas tax. With the new money, legislators must get a commitment for Baltimore-area projects, particularly transit links west to Woodlawn and east to Morgan State University. Also, continue the 40 percent farebox recovery rate for the city's transit lines.\ Environment - Support the governor's plan to add a modest surcharge to water bills to improve sewage treatment plants, and upgrade the state's ""brownfields"" program to make industrial sites more attractive for redevelopment.\ Economic development - Fulfill this year's promised commitments for city projects: $9 million for west-side development and $15 million for the east-side life science and technology park. Keep the state's tax credit for historic preservation and close the Delaware loophole to prevent corporations from avoiding income taxes.\ Health - Address the recent surge in physician malpractice costs without unfairly curtailing victims' rights, improve the uninsured's access to community-based health care, and reduce Medicaid costs without harming the poor. Continue the city's lead paint initiative. Increase funds for community-based drug abuse treatment.\ Public safety - Update and expand Maryland's ban on assault- style weapons to offset diminished federal efforts. Increase penalties for intimidating criminal victims and witnesses."
322,"Delaware Sen. Tom Carper has ended his improbable effort to pass a long-term transportation funding bill during this Congress's lame-duck session.\The Delaware Democrat said Friday he will focus on passage of a bill during the next Congress. A conversation with House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio just before Thanksgiving dashed his hopes for quick action.\Carper said Boehner told him, ""We've just got too little time and too much to do.""\""It's not fair for me to ask Senate members to walk the plank and make tough votes when we know that the House isn't even going to bring up that legislation,"" Carper said. ""We'll have the first five months of next year to focus, to find consensus on transportation policy.""\Boehner told ABC's ""This Week"" in September that passing a long-term transportation bill during President Barack Obama's last two years in office is ""in the realm of doable."" A spokesman for Boehner declined to comment on Carper's statement.\Congress passed its latest short-term fix in August, assuring funding for transportation projects through May. Lawmakers haven't been able to agree on how to finance a six-year authorization measure that passed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in May.\The Senate passed legislation by Carper that was designed to force faster action on a long-term funding bill. But the House rejected that measure.\Postponement of long-term funding legislation means committee work on the authorization will also have to start over in the 114th Congress, when Republicans will control the Senate and have a larger majority in the House.\""I have worked night and day for months to create a dynamic that would compel us to make tough decisions, not sometime next year but during this lame-duck session,"" Carper said.\After the latest short-term federal fix, Delaware moved forward with transportation projects scheduled for fiscal 2015. But state Transportation Secretary Shailen Bhatt said last month the outgoing Congress needed to act before the end of the year to restore the Highway Trust Fund. The fund finances transportation projects, mostly using revenue from the federal gas tax.\""Improving safety and repairing aging infrastructure during the spring and summer construction season depends on states knowing this winter that federal money will be available,"" Bhatt said in a Nov. 18 statement. ""In Delaware, we have a contingency borrowing strategy in place that will allow us to move projects forward for a short while, but states should not have to engage in creative financing to solve a federal budget problem.""\The nation's transportation system is threatened by short-term federal funding measures and will be ""in trouble"" unless it gets more money, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told USA TODAY reporters last month.\Infrastructure in Delaware and other states is aging and the federal government isn't spending enough to maintain it, Foxx said.\Delawareans pay more to maintain their vehicles -- more than $380 annually -- than they would if the system were in better shape, he said.\""This issue affects every community, every user of our system, whether they're driving, whether they're using transit in some way,"" Foxx said. ""And I don't see how we can get through this in a good way as a country without Congress coming to the table and actually passing a long-term transportation bill.""\Contact Nicole Gaudiano at ngaudiano@gannett.com.

Marylanders who voted for Gov. Larry Hogan and listened to his State of the State speech last week were probably pleased to discover he still sounds like the candidate who got a majority in November. Democratic legislators in the audience Wednesday seem to have been irritated for exactly the same reason.
\
Hogan is genuinely committed to bipartisanship and has shown it with some of his appointments. But why should that mean he has changed his mind about the issues that got him elected? After all, his central premise is that the state has been mismanaged for years, and this was bound to come out when he made a major policy speech. Also, a lot of the same Democrats miffed by Hogan probably loved President Barack Obama's in-your-face presentation of a liberal agenda to a Republican Congress - even though the president, unlike the governor, lacked a recent electoral triumph to back up his words.
\
There was a good deal to like in Hogan's speech, and one of the things we liked the most came at the end, and will require no legislative approval. After blasting Maryland's addiction to gerrymandering, Hogan promised an executive order to create ""a bipartisan commission to examine Maryland's redistricting process with the goal of fully reforming this process and giving this authority to an independent, bipartisan commission."" This means Hogan is willing, if he gets a second term, to forgo the partisan incumbent-protection shenanigans that have long been the governor's prerogative. Good for him.
\
The governor is also trying to make good, as much as Maryland's straitened finances permit, on his promise of tax relief. He wants a tax exemption on the first $10,000 in personal property, which he estimates would eliminate the tax for more than 70,000 small-business owners. As a small step toward an eventual goal of eliminating income taxes on all retirement income, he wants to repeal those taxes on pensions for retired police, firefighters, first responders and military personnel. And he wants to repeal the automatic increases in the gas tax.
\
The chances of that last one are particularly slight, given the pain legislative leaders have already endured to enact those tax increases - and given that Baltimore and the Washington suburbs want that revenue for their light rail projects. But Hogan is right in principle. There shouldn't be automatic tax increases any more than there should be automatic legislative salary increases. The legislature should vote on every single tax increase, after a debate setting out what the extra revenue would be spent on.
\
Chances are also minimal for another of Hogan's tax repeals, this one on the stormwater fee mandate the governor, like most Republicans, insists on calling ""the rain tax."" We don't care for this proposal, but it's no surprise, given what Hogan said during his campaign.
\
Even if the legislature balks - as we expect - Hogan can achieve much the same thing by instructing the state Department of the Environment to be lenient about how it interprets the law. And he can't do anything about the fact the counties, with or without state help, will have to pay for extensive stormwater remediation work to meet federal standards.
\
But all in all, the speech had a number of good ideas - and a lot to reassure Maryland voters that Hogan intends to do all he can to advance the priorities on which he campaigned. The question now is how much common ground he can find with the legislature.
"
324," We may not have an economic crisis yet. But you can tell there's a perceived political crisis when President Bush starts to imitate Jimmy Car- ter.\ On Monday Bush asked all Americans to be ""better conservers of energy"" by skipping nonessential driving. ""We can all pitch in,"" he said, according to transcription services.\ Bush also urged federal employees to carpool or use mass-transit and said the government would shift electricity use to off-peak hours, reducing demand when the grid is stressed.\ It was reminiscent of when former President Carter donned a sweater, sat by a fire and asked Americans to save energy by turning down thermostats during the natural gas shortages of the late 1970s.\ And it was a striking nod to ""demand-side"" management from an administration that once seemed to believe voracious energy use is an American birthright, and the heck with consequences.\ ""Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it cannot be the basis of a sound energy policy,"" Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2001, as noted by numerous news organizations.\ Asked the same year whether people should change lifestyles to alleviate an energy crisis, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ""That's a big no,"" adding, ""The president believes that it's an American way of life, and it should the goal of policymakers to protect the American way of life.""\ Now former oilman Bush is asking Americans to give up a little slice of their way of life for the greater good, at least temporarily.\ It's political crisis control as much as economic. With 2006 elections approaching, the administration has been blasted for appearing uncaring and aloof as millions suffer from storms and high gas prices.\ Spouting an ""all-for-one"" line lets Bush fly the flag of communitarian sacrifice without anybody worrying he'll actually enforce it. (Carter, on the other hand, gave the impression he would personally inspect your thermostat AND the wool content of your sweaters.)\ But the short-term vitality of the economy is threatened, too.\ Consumer confidence has plunged, retail sales are weak, and high energy prices could lead to lackluster holiday shopping, which would be even worse for Republicans next year than the perception that they're detached corporate lackeys.\ By my calculation oil prices have now increased enough since 2003 to take more than $100 billion out of Americans' pockets each year. At less than 2 percent of annual personal consumption of $8 trillion or so, that's not an enormous amount.\ But it's getting to the point where it could make a difference, and people on both sides of the political aisle in Washington are starting to talk about remedies.\ On Monday presidential spokesman Scott McClellan again urged Congress to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, a move that would do little to change petroleum prices or make the country energy-secure but could irreparably sully our natural heritage.\ People also are talking again about expanding coastal oil drilling, another risk that might cost more in environmental harm than it would deliver in energy benefits. Congressional Republicans are floating the idea of oil-refinery tax breaks for an industry that is making record profits, which doesn't make much more sense than Democratic proposals to expropriate oil-company assets through a ""windfall profits"" tax. (Another Carter-era idea.)\ Some of the administration's short-term supply remedies make sense. Tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and temporarily relaxing shipping and environmental emissions rules can ease the temporary crunch, if that's what it is.\ But long term, the biggest policy gains are to be had on the demand side - and not by encouraging cardigans and fewer drives to Wal-Mart. Stricter mileage standards would simultaneously reduce gas usage, improve the environment and promote safety by discouraging unnecessarily heavy vehicles.\ A bigger gas tax would further discourage petroleum use, encourage alternatives and finance federal research on fuel cells and solar power. Together they might forestall a real crisis in the future, with even more opportunities for mischief."
325,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked the advancement of a transportation bill, a piece of legislation that traditionally has enjoyed broad bipartisan support.\The vote was 52-44, short of the 60 needed to take up the bill. \""I don't know why everything we do has to be a fight,"" lamented Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. \Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the parties are close to an agreement on amendments that would be considered. \Last week, Republicans tried to tack on a measure that would have allowed employers, on religious grounds, to opt out of new federal rules requiring insurance companies to offer certain services, including contraceptive care. \Advancing the legislation in the Senate was seen as a crucial step, as House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, struggled to corral votes in that chamber in the face of a backlash against federal spending. \Democratic leaders are portraying the standoff as another showdown led by right-flank conservatives. \""What we're seeing on the highway bill is a repeat of the payroll tax cut debate,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., referring to the recent battle to extend the reduction in Social Security payroll taxes for the rest of 2012. ""It's time for Republicans to stop letting the far right call the shots."" \Transportation bills have traditionally been among the most popular pieces of legislation, often passing with strong bipartisan support. \This year's efforts have been seen by supporters as crucial to boosting the nation's still-sluggish economy by saving or creating as many as 3 million jobs. \But detractors, particularly conservatives, are resisting the costs at a time when lawmakers are focused on deficit reduction. Though the legislation is a priority for Boehner, Republicans have been forced to rewrite their bill after a rebellion within their ranks over a variety of issues, including its five-year, $260 billion price tag. \""The bill before the Senate spends more than we can afford,"" Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., wrote in an opinion piece Tuesday in The Washington Post. ""If we fail this small test, how will we ever pass a sweeping agreement to cut the deficit?"" \Republicans in the Senate said Tuesday they had agreed to a ""reasonable"" list of amendments, according to a GOP leadership aide, but Democrats had not yet signed off on the deal. \A major challenge facing congressional leaders is to maintain the current level of funding for popular road projects without adding to the federal budget deficit. \Because consumers are buying more fuel-efficient cars, the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax isn't bringing in enough money to maintain current funding. \And with Congress ending the practice of lawmakers earmarking funds for pet projects, leaders have limited opportunities to dole out incentives to bring in votes. Earmarking helped win votes for bills in the past but sparked a public outcry after the last big transportation bill, in 2005, was filled with thousands of earmarks. \""Do any of you have any idea how difficult it is to do a transportation bill without earmarks?"" House Transportation Committee Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., said this year. \""It's a lot harder to win votes when you don't have goodies to pass out,"" Boehner recently acknowledged. \Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who as chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is leading the bill through the debate, recently told her colleagues that with support from organizations including labor unions and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ""There is no reason for us not to get this done."" \rsimon@tribune.com\Credit: Tribune Newspapers"
326,"WASHINGTON - As gasoline prices soar to new records, America's president - and the two men who hope to succeed him - are offering only partial or long-term solutions and ignoring three steps that many experts say could bring some relief now.\Americans began this workweek by crossing a dismal threshold, paying a once-unthinkable nationwide record average of $4.02 per gallon for unleaded gasoline and the prospect of even higher prices in months ahead.\On Monday, President Bush said one answer is to increase oil drilling in Alaska and offshore. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain's chief economic adviser renewed McCain's call to suspend the federal gasoline tax of 18.4 cents a gallon. Presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama called for a windfall profits tax on oil companies, an idea that stalled yesterday in the Senate.\Independent experts, however, said that government could take at least three other steps that could force oil and gasoline prices down immediately. Neither Bush, McCain nor Obama endorse any of them.\Perhaps the quickest action, the experts said, would be ordering restraints on financial speculation. Financial industry heavyweights have acknowledged in recent testimony before Congress that such speculation is driving oil prices higher.\President Bush could order the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate U.S. investments in those markets with a snap of his fingers, said Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland and a former director of trading for the commission.\""Essentially this could be ended this afternoon if the Bush administration had the stomach to do it,"" he said. ""Those abdications of responsibility and allowing these exchanges to trade in 'dark' markets ... provides an environment for speculators to thrive."" The term dark refers to markets in London and Dubai not subject to U.S. regulations.\The CFTC is investigating the link between speculation and oil prices but hasn't scheduled any action. The commission is also part of a U.S. task force, announced yesterday, that will examine oil supply and demand factors, investor practices and the role of new players in the markets, such as speculators and index traders,\A second partial solution would be to boost the supply of oil available on the market by releasing as much as 1 million barrels a day of oil now held in the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That step is being pushed by, among others, the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank run by several former Clinton administration officials.\Do that for 90 days - through the summer driving season when consumer demand for gasoline is highest - and the reserve would lose less than 15 percent of the oil held in case of national emergency, advocates say.\Finally, the Federal Reserve could act to boost the weak dollar, which has led oil producers to demand higher prices for oil, because oil generally is traded in dollars. Oil producers want higher prices to offset the cost of converting dollars into euros and other currencies that have grown stronger against the dollar.\The best way to bolster a currency is to boost interest rates, but the Federal Reserve has been reluctant to do that with the United States teetering on the brink of recession. The central bank in Europe, where growth is more robust, is poised to raise rates, however. That could weaken the dollar further, and drive oil prices even higher.\Senate Democrats failed yesterday to muster 60 votes to allow a vote on legislation that could significantly affect the oil industry and oil prices. The legislation would, among other things, instruct CFTC regulators to require investors to plunk down more of their own money if they want to speculate in oil markets.\The proposal for a gas-tax holiday has little traction in the Democratic Congress, and many economists oppose it as likely to spur consumption and make things worse.\Speaking in Raleigh, N.C., Monday, Obama repeated his call for a tax on high oil company profits to finance aid programs for the poorest Americans.\Longer term though, Obama said, the only answers are to increase the use of alternative energy - solar, wind, biodiesel, clean-coal technology - and to increase fuel-mileage standards for vehicles and develop hybrid-electric cars, which will take time.\McCain's longer-term answers turn more toward increasing production of oil from offshore and from oil-shale deposits in the mountain West.\Credit: McClatchy-Tribune"
327,"
A couple of generations ago, this country's infrastructure was the envy of the world.
\
Today, this very same infrastructure has fallen victim to extraordinary neglect. A staggering $2.2 trillion is estimated to be required over the next five years to repair and rehabilitate our nation's infrastructure, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.
\
The quality of our nation's infrastructure has a direct impact on the quality of life and economic health we all enjoy. Today, the condition of our infrastructure is jeopardizing our future prosperity - including right here in Annapolis.
\
Annapolis is served by a water treatment plant that dates back to the early 1930s. The plant, a tremendous quality-of-life improvement in Depression-era Annapolis, has reached the end of its service life. Similarly, many of the city's water and sewer pipes were installed during the first half of the 20th century and now are in need of replacement.
\
Generally, the oldest water and sewer pipes are in the Historic District and older neighborhoods along inner West Street and Eastport. The oldest known in-service water pipes are the mains along outer West Street that originally brought water downtown, by gravity, from the Water Treatment Plant. These pipes have a date stamp of 1896.
\
Clean water is critical to every resident and visitor in Annapolis. Public health, the economy and our environment will be compromised if the city fails to properly care for its water and sewer systems. To maintain a livable and economically vital community, the city must invest millions of dollars in its utilities infrastructure over the next 20 to 25 years.
\
To make matters worse, the city has not kept its water and sewer rates at an adequate level. The city's water and sewer enterprise funds are supposed to be self-sustaining through rates that cover all operating, maintenance, financing and capital costs. Since 1999, during a time in which the average sewer rates for the 50 largest cities in the U.S. increased by more than 100 percent and the average water rates increased by more than 95 percent, the city's rates increased by 0 percent and 24 percent, respectively. As a result, the General Fund has subsidized the water and sewer funds to the tune of several million dollars. This condition requires immediate correction through the proper setting of the rates.
\
The city's sidewalk and street infrastructure also are in need of extensive repair and rehabilitation. Many sidewalks in Murray Hill and Eastport, and along Tyler Avenue, Riding Ridge and Chinquapin Round roads, among others, require immediate replacement.
\
The bleak state of our right-of-way infrastructure is due to funding needs far outpacing available funding. Cuts in gas tax funds from the state have only served to exacerbate the city's funding shortfall. Although needed repairs to streets and sidewalks are not funded via enterprise funds such as the utilities, dedicated funding is required to address the capital needs. Delaying needed repair and rehabilitation work only serves to exponentially increase its eventual cost.
\
Local governments are facing a tremendous challenge in meeting stormwater funding needs. Unfunded state and federal mandates, aging and failing storm drain systems, and new capital needs are increasing while available funding remains flat.
\
The city's current stormwater fee is not adequate and, as a result, we are in danger of falling behind on permit and regulatory requirements, along with annual maintenance, capital and other needs.
\
Shoreline erosion mitigation and water quality improvements would benefit from additional funding. An adequately funded stormwater program, in addition to meeting federal mandates and providing regular maintenance to existing stormwater facilities, will create ""green"" capital projects that reduce flooding and add to Annapolis' aesthetic appeal to attract new businesses and residents.
\
Annapolis cannot afford to ignore these critical infrastructure issues and is addressing them head-on. The proposed fiscal 2012 budget Mayor Josh Cohen is submitting to the City Council tomorrow reflects his commitment to adequately fund and maintain our critical infrastructure for future generations. The time for action is now.

328,"Last year, the House of Delegates passed HB 1091, a bill that required greater legislative oversight of public-private partnerships valued at more than $500 million. The measure died in the Senate, which is a real shame because it would come in handy right now. That's because Maryland's largest such partnership or P3 - a proposed $11 billion-or-more widening of Interstate 270 and Maryland's portion of the Capital Beltway - is on hold right now because Comptroller Peter Franchot is asking questions that Gov. Larry Hogan and the Maryland Department of Transportation aren't answering.\Rarely has such a massive public infrastructure project in this state faced as little public scrutiny - and as many objections from local elected officials and residents - as this one. Yet it was moving forward toward the bidding stage at disconcerting speed, at least it was until Mr. Franchot intervened and declined to endorse the plan now pending before the Board of Public Works, the three-member body on which the comptroller holds the crucial swing vote. As might be expected, Mr. Franchot is now taking some social media salvos from the governor and his supporters. But on this issue, he is firmly in the right. Why the rush to do this wrong? Why, as Mr. Franchot has posted on Facebook, force this ""unvetted proposal that is only half-baked"" down everyone's throats?\There's no question that the D.C. suburbs have a traffic congestion problem, but a project of this scale requires caution and consensus. Certainly, Baltimore's proposed $2.9 billion Red Line had that before Governor Hogan killed it four years ago. Baltimore County's executive had come on board. So had the city's mayor. In Annapolis, the governor and lawmakers had their say and voted for funding. But a P3 is different. It doesn't get this level of oversight because it's not dependent on tax dollars but on private financing supported by toll revenue from the added lanes. That puts far too much power in the hands of the governor. The Board of Public Works is the only check on that authority, and that's too much to expect from just three people (one of whom is the governor, always a sure yes vote on his own initiatives) given the complexities.\Naturally, Mr. Franchot's stand has gotten a political spin in State House circles. It's because he's mulling a run for governor in 2022 and the Democrat needs to shore up his party's support, some say. Certainly, the comptroller has been helpful to the Republican governor's agenda in the past, often siding with him on crucial BPW votes while publicly haranguing the legislature's Democratic leaders. Others see the former Montgomery County delegate with populist inclinations as simply reacting to his voter base and widespread misgivings about the project, including the taking of private properties along the route. All could be true, but it's of little importance.\At the heart of the matter isn't politics, it's policy. Major transportation projects of the past were far more driven by consensus because they had to be. How could a governor expect the Maryland General Assembly to finance some new initiative (usually with a gas tax increase) unless most everyone was on board? But that's not part of the P3 formula, and shame on the state Senate for not recognizing this potential problem. In seeking to convenience public-private partnerships, legislators have provided insufficient oversight. And that's something they'll need to correct in 2020, not just because of the the current standoff but to avoid future projects foisted on the state by future governors.\One other point: Mr. Franchot had tried to negotiate a compromise with Mr. Hogan, insisting that a federal environment review move forward before any private property was acquired, making sure a certain percentage of revenue went toward transit and making I-270 a higher priority. Apparently, those conditions were later withdrawn, which is why Mr. Franchot supported the project at one point but opposes it now. We would argue that it should not have come down to a negotiation between the two men. While the comptroller deserves credit for standing up to the governor on a matter of great consequence, how much better if all stakeholders in such an important undertaking had a say and their own questions answered. Democracy is, admittedly, tough, but it's better than transportation policy by gubernatorial decree.\Caption: Traffic backups such as this one Dec. 2 are not unusual where the Capital Beltway meets the I-270 spur any time of day.\The Washington Post"
329,"When traveling this summer, you will likely encounter some combination of traffic on the highway, large crowds and delays at the airport and high gas prices. Some of this is the natural result of vacation season, but these experiences are also due to the declining state of our nation's infrastructure. While you may not fully appreciate it as you sit frustrated in bumper-to-bumper traffic, the time is ripe to follow a new path for improving our roads, bridges, pipelines and more -- essential investments for bettering our economy and strongly positioning the U.S. to be more competitive in the future.\The poor state of our nation's infrastructure is shocking. Recent Federal data indicate that 63,000 U.S. bridges are in need of significant repair; 333 of them are in Maryland. And driving on roads in need of repair costs the state nearly $1.6 billion a year in operating costs and vehicle repairs; that's $422 per motorist. \There is a direct correlation between investing in infrastructure and improving the economy, including the nation's employment rate. While our economy continues to improve following the Great Recession, it is not growing nearly fast enough for many. As of April, the unemployment rate for people with only a high school degree was almost double that of someone with a bachelor's degree or higher, and the rate for people who had not finished high school was just about triple the rate for people who had a college education. Many unemployed, non-college graduates are in the construction industry, which is currently experiencing double-digit unemployment and has not seen the sustained pick-up necessary to truly lift our economy. \Traditionally, government has been the primary investor in infrastructure, but this cannot continue as the costs are higher than what the public is likely willing to spend. In the coming months, the Highway Trust Fund, a critical source of federal government backed infrastructure investment, will be depleted. The Baltimore Sun recently advocated for an increase in the federal gas tax to avoid the shortfall as it also noted that similar increases in Maryland have not hampered economic growth. While this is an important short-term measure, it will not alone adequately ensure our future global competitiveness. The private sector accounts for only 6 percent of infrastructure funding. Encouraging private-sector investment in our infrastructure in a transparent, secure manner is essential both to improving the roads and keeping businesses here. A consequence of poorer infrastructure is that it encourages employers to locate their businesses elsewhere -- in a different city, state or country. \Currently, conditions appear to be emerging that, if taken advantage of through public-private partnerships, can help our economy now and better position our nation for years to come. Business-oriented groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have recently come out strongly supporting infrastructure investments as a way of boosting our economy while also arguing for more streamlined, predictable permitting and regulatory processes. Permits and regulations ensuring the safety of people and the environment are essential, but they must be appropriately applied so that projects can be completed efficiently to make a positive economic impact. In addition, in the U.S. alone, companies are holding close to $2 trillion on the sidelines and earning very little as a result. The injection of some of their capital through private investment could help to address our infrastructure shortcomings that government alone cannot solve. \Congress should not only boost the fund but also take steps to incentivize public-private partnerships in infrastructure investment. Some iteration of the Obama administration's idea of an infrastructure bank, which would work with private investors to finance projects through cheap long-term loans or loan guarantees, may be a place to start. \Our infrastructure challenges cannot be solved by traditional, government-based solutions. Merging private investment with smart government expenditures will make for a foundational 21st-century public-private partnership that builds American competitiveness in the long term while creating jobs and boosting the economy in the near term. \Mike Beland is an adjunct professor at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law and a visiting fellow at the Center for Health and Homeland Security.

330,"If you're a liberal living in Maryland, there's been plenty of reason to smile lately. The Old Line State continues to beat a steady path toward leading a new vanguard of progressive policy and politics in the United States.\Let's start with last November's elections. Actually, no: To understand why those elections mattered, let's back up two more years to the 2010 statewide elections. \Nationally, the 2010 cycle was nothing short of a nightmare for liberals and Democrats. The Democrats lost the U.S. House and, if not for a few self-destructing Republican Senate candidates, would have lost both chambers of Congress. Republicans won the governor's races in Wisconsin and Michigan, setting the stage for a coordinated pushback against state pensions and public sector unions. \Two days after the election at a (rare) White House press conference, President Barack Obama admitted that he and his fellow Democrats suffered a ""shellacking."" The major casualty for Maryland Democrats was the defeat of 1st District Rep. Frank Kratovil, a rookie Democrat swept into office on Mr. Obama's coattails, by Republican Andy Harris. \But Gov. Martin O'Malley had perhaps the best electoral night of any Democrat in the country. He beat his predecessor, Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., by twice the margin of victory from four years earlier -- a pretty remarkable feat, given that 2006 was a strong Democratic cycle and 2010 was a strong Republican year. \By 2012, however, Republicans in the state thought Mr. O'Malley and his agenda were vulnerable to popular backlash. So the GOP put key policy measures on the statewide ballot in an attempt to embarrass and rebuke the governor. \One measure was strictly partisan-electoral: a veto referendum of the Maryland congressional district map. Although I have criticized the partisan gerrymandering of the state in this space, putting such a matter to statewide vote was just as political as the mapmaking process itself. \But the real policy victories were elsewhere on the ballot, specifically the approval of both the so-called Dream Act, granting in-state tuition for some children of undocumented immigrants, and the somewhat surprising approval of marriage rights for same-sex partners. \Of the four states in which same-sex marriage was on the ballot last November (the others: Maine, Minnesota and Washington), Maryland was expected by some gay rights advocates to be the least likely to approve it, given the state's sizable Catholic and African American populations. \The same-sex marriage provision passed narrowly (52 percent), the Dream Act a bit more comfortably (58 percent). But the wins are the thing, as the saying goes. \The 2013 session of the Maryland General Assembly continued the state's push toward a variety of progressive reforms, some of which passed and some of which made important headway toward future adoption. The gas tax will be raised 10 cents per gallon. The death penalty was repealed. \A five-cent statewide tax on plastic bags failed, but it is gaining traction. Ditto for a bottle deposit bill. And I wouldn't be surprised if these two reforms are enacted in the next few years, which would be good news for the state's environment. The bag tax implemented by the neighboring District of Columbia has been an almost unqualified success. And if you haven't googled the term ""giant ocean garbage patch"" yet, perhaps you should -- because then you'll understand why it would be beneficial for all American states to adopt bottle deposit bills. \Liberals didn't get everything they wanted. The attempt to gradually raise the state's minimum wage to $10 per hour -- and then benchmark it to inflation thereafter -- was soundly rejected in March by the Senate Finance Committee. That's a shame, given that in 10 other states (some of which have lower costs of living than Maryland's) new minimum wages above the $7.25 federal level already took effect on January 1 this year. \Maryland was one of just a handful of states where President Obama in 2012 increased his popular vote margin of victory from four years earlier. Already one of America's bluest states, Maryland seems to be getting bluer with each passing year. Liberals still have plenty of work to do, but lately have ample reasons to be encouraged. \Thomas F. Schaller teaches political science at UMBC. His column appears every other Wednesday. His email is schaller67@gmail.com. Twitter: @schaller67."
331," Maryland Democrats won big at the polls in November, but what does that mean for the future of the state? In three days, the picture will start to become clear as those newly elected lawmakers convene in Annapolis for the annual 90-day General Assembly session. It's certain to be a kinder, gentler place with a Democratic governor set to be sworn into office in 10 days and solid Democratic majorities in the House of Delegates and state Senate. But not necessarily that much kinder.\ Potentially divisive issues loom, particularly in the areas of taxes and spending. This year, a projected shortfall in the state budget appears to be manageable, but in the long term, it's catastrophic - more than $1 billion annually. Add to that promises made by Gov.-elect Martin O'Malley during the campaign to increase spending on school construction, on land conservation and on higher education, and you have a fiscal nightmare.\ Will freshman lawmakers be interested in raising taxes before they've barely warmed their seats? Not likely. Mr. O'Malley has yet to name much of his Cabinet and appears reluctant to push for any major tax increase this year. Conventional wisdom is that the second year of a four-year term is generally the most ambitious for setting new policy.\ But that doesn't mean major initiatives won't be considered - and that could begin with a push for slot machines and for a $1-per- pack increase in the state's tobacco tax. The former remains a fundamentally misguided idea that's certain to produce the usual political gridlock (Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller wants them badly; House Speaker Michael E. Busch just as strongly does not). But the latter is gaining momentum and could turn out to be the most meaningful issue of the session.\ Not only would doubling the cigarette tax help curb smoking, but the revenue it would produce - as much as $200 million or more the first year - would go a long way toward improving access to health care and reducing Medicaid's chunk of the state budget deficit.\ Health care and spending aren't the only weighty matters set to be debated in the halls of the State House, of course. Issues from what to do about polluted air and water to the death penalty and the right of same-sex couples to marry (an issue that could be brought to the fore by a pending Court of Appeals decision) also loom. A successful legislative session would include:\ Election law: A constitutional amendment is needed to institute early voting in Maryland. Lawmakers face a harder choice in determining what to do about the state's electronic voting machines and the risk of fraud. Either the situation is fixable or the state must switch to a new system.\ Education: Mr. O'Malley must provide the $400 million in public school construction funds he promised during the campaign. Less clear is whether lawmakers should endorse the ""geographic cost of educating"" component that is less helpful to poorer jurisdictions such as Baltimore.\ Environment: If Maryland is to get serious about cleaning the air, adopting California-style emissions standards for new cars is the next logical step. The state should expand efforts to enhance the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster population.\ Health care: Closing the loophole that allows bars and certain restaurants to be exempt from Maryland's ban on smoking in the workplace should be a top priority.\ Legal reform: Documented abuses of Maryland's peculiar tradition of ground rent, especially in Baltimore, require action. That should include phasing out the arcane system entirely. Lawmakers also need to take steps to ensure that at-will state employees who perform their jobs well will not be fired for purely political reasons, a practice that recently generated a great deal of furor.\ Public safety: The state should place a temporary moratorium on the death penalty and launch a comprehensive and objective analysis to see if capital punishment has been - and can be - meted out fairly, equitably and humanely in Maryland.\ Economic development: Lawmakers must develop a strategy to address the impact of the growth fueled by the federal Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decisions. The state role in planning needs to expand so that neighboring jurisdictions don't make decisions at cross-purposes. Also, restrictions on the Heritage Structure Rehabilitation Tax Credit that have unfairly capped Baltimore's participation in this important program should be lifted.\ Transportation: The Assembly should begin exploring new revenue sources, including raising the gas tax, to boost the state's depleted transit and highway fund, a move that could help address the impact of BRAC-related growth."
332,"Investigators won't know for certain the cause of Monday's fatal explosion in Reisterstown Station for weeks, perhaps months, yet. As devastating as it proved to be - killing at least two people, injuring seven others and turning three row homes to rubble - such disasters are mercifully uncommon; federal authorities reported about a dozen deaths from ""significant"" gas distribution incidents in all of last year. But what is far more common are leaky natural gas pipes, particularly in older cities such as Baltimore, which still have some antique cast iron infrastructure underground. Baltimore Gas and Electric receives 8,000 or more complaints of leaks each year, about two-thirds regarded as non-hazardous. All leaks in residential areas are classified as hazardous.\The utility is perfectly well aware of the problem, and it embarked years ago on an aggressive supplemental state-mandated program of repair and replacement of natural gas mains, service pipes, valves, joints and other potentially failing systems. Called the Maryland Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement (STRIDE) program, customers with BGE and other Maryland gas providers may have noticed the monthly small surcharge that pays for that work. This 20-year, pay-as-you-go model has long been touted as the most practical way of picking up the slack, and BGE proudly noted last year that it's already resulted in about a $430 million investment and at least 260 miles of replacement pipeline since 2014. But is that enough?\A horrifying event like a gas explosion so powerful that it registered on a seismic monitor in Owings Mills may be an outlier, but the tension between keeping utilities in top condition while maintaining rates as low as feasible is ever-present. Earlier this year, BGE submitted to the Maryland Public Service Commission a multi-year rate plan that keeps residential gas and electric rates at current levels into 2023 when they'll be allowed to rise a combined 8.3% ($12.87 per month). The rationale was that freezing rates would be helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic when so many families are financially stretched and, further, that continued flat rates might help stimulate an economic recovery. But might a greater, earlier investment in gas line replacement actually prove more helpful to the region's well-being?\We aren't certain, frankly, but it's a subject that deserves further exploration. The gas line serving the 4200 block of Labyrinth Road dates from the early 1960s and was not even a candidate for STRIDE (which is focused on low-pressure century-old pipes, not the protected steel found in this case). So even a more robust STRIDE investment would have made no difference in this particular event. Further, a gas explosion can be caused by any number of factors including a faulty appliance. There had been no reports of leaks in the neighborhood and preliminary federal findings suggest the event originated inside one of the row-houses not with the pipeline.\Still, there's really no such thing as over-investment in infrastructure. Fewer gas line leaks would not only make energy delivery more efficient but would spare the environment, as methane is a major greenhouse gas contributing to climate change causing more harm pound-for-pound than carbon dioxide. And research published last year found more methane escaping into the skies above Baltimore than previously thought.\Here's another factor to consider. Utility bills remain quite affordable by historic standards. Even with a 2023 rate increase, Maryland residential customers can expect to pay less each month for electric and gas than they did in 2008, a benefit of the nation's falling commodity prices. At the very least, it would seem reasonable for the PSC to explore expanding STRIDE, perhaps by charging customers more than the maximum $2 per month allowed by law (currently it's $1.03 on the monthly BGE bill). That would seem a win-win for all involved no matter whether leaking pipes had anything to do with this week's tragedy.\Meanwhile, it would be nice if failing public infrastructure somehow found its way on the radar of elected officials in Washington who continue to fiddle while the nation's roads, airports, tunnels, transit, drinking water and sewage systems and on and on deteriorate. The latest American Society of Civil Engineers report card gives the U.S. a collective D-plus. Maryland gets a more gentlemanly C, but its energy systems receive a less auspicious C-minus. Ratepayers need not be the only ones concerned about keeping things working properly. Politicians often promise a big investment from the government side, but when it comes time to pay the bill - to raise the federal gas tax, for example - they stand pat with a 1993-era standard. Eventually, the piper must be paid.\Caption: Workers assess the scene in Baltimore's Reisterstown Station neighborhood a day after an explosion leveled three homes.\Jerry Jackson/Baltimore Sun"
333,"TARRYTOWN, N.Y. -- Without quick action by Congress, the U.S. Transportation Department may begin scaling back or halting work on thousands of roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects at the height of the construction season this July, when the nation's Highway Trust Fund is expected to run dry.\As recent spending battles in Washington have shown, finding bipartisan cooperation to prevent the fund from becoming insolvent will be no easy task, particularly in an election year. \The standoff is the latest example of partisan gridlock on Capitol Hill, reminiscent of similar battles over the budget. Some are already referring to the transportation funding deadline as the ""highway cliff,"" a reference to the 2012 ""fiscal cliff"" fight over expiring tax rates and the debt ceiling. \On Wednesday, President Barack Obama prodded Congress to move quickly, calling infrastructure investment essential to the nation's economic future. \""First-class infrastructure attracts first-class jobs,"" Obama said, standing against the backdrop of one of the nation's most ambitious projects -- New York's aging Tappan Zee Bridge and its partially built $4 billion replacement. \Failure to agree on new funding sources for the Highway Trust Fund will put at risk more than 112,000 highway projects, 5,600 transit programs and nearly 700,000 jobs, the White House warned. \In addition to keeping federal money flowing, lawmakers must come up with a longer-term solution to close a projected $16 billion annual shortfall in the fund. But key figures on Capitol Hill remain at odds over how to make up the gap. \Washington is in this jam because taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, which provide 90 percent of the revenues for the Highway Trust Fund, no longer raise sufficient money to support the programs, in part because cars have become more fuel-efficient. \Congress last passed a major transportation bill in 2012, authorizing spending on everything from public transit to safety programs. Major business groups and labor unions are pushing lawmakers to pass a longer-term package. Some lawmakers are also eager to renew the bill because it would give them an opportunity to trumpet the role of the federal government. \Lawmakers are only now taking their first steps. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, announced a bipartisan proposal this week that would keep highway spending at existing levels, indexed for inflation, for six years. But the plan was silent on the key question of how to replenish the trust fund, leaving that to the Senate Finance Committee. \The previous two-year transportation bill relied on tapping funds from the Treasury to make up for a projected gap, but it ran dry faster than anticipated. \One proposed solution would increase the current 18.4-cent-per-gallon gas tax. Federal fuel taxes have not been raised since 1993, but doing so this year seems unlikely when the entire House and more than a third of the Senate is up for election. \Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House transportation committee, has yet to put forward a proposal. Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., the departing chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called for dedicating $126.5 billion to the trust fund as part of a major overhaul of the nation's tax code, which would fully pay for highway projects for eight years. \The White House has also called for replenishing the trust fund through an overhaul of the corporate tax system. \""This is an area where there is bipartisan interest,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told reporters this week. ""It's just that we have to play this out and work hard every day to make progress on it."" \But prospects for a major deal on tax reform are dim, and time is running out for other proposals to emerge. \""The uncertainty is troubling,"" said David Parkhurst, staff director for the National Governors Association's office of federal relations, noting that states are likely to bear the brunt of the impact if the funding lapse is not avoided. \""The states have spent the money. The states have paid the bill,"" Parkhurst said. ""If the trust fund shortfall goes down to zero and the federal government is unable to make those cash reimbursement payments to the states for work already done, the states are on the hook."" \khennessey@tribune.com\Credit: Tribune Washington Bureau"

Peterson should resign

I was shocked after reading the quote attributed to Eugene Peterson in ""Worth Repeating"" (The Capital, Jan. 28).

\
Can you imagine the outrage if this quote was actually expressed by a person of leadership who happened to not look like Peterson? Yet, Peterson feels very comfortable expressing his belief that Mike Wagner should be disqualified as an acceptable candidate for the county school board based on nothing other than Wagner is ""another white guy.""

No coward
\
""I let my feelings get the better of me."" So spoke Katie O'Malley, a sitting judge in the Baltimore City Court System, of her reference to certain gay marriage opponents as ""cowards.""
\
O'Malley's candid admission can hardly be reassuring to the litigants every day appearing before her, expecting their cases to be decided impartially, based on logic and the law.
\
As for O'Malley's contention that religion should play no role in our political life, has she ever read the Declaration of Independence? It references the deity at least four times (i.e., Nature's God, Creator, Supreme Judge of the World, and divine Providence).
\
If he were alive today, it is a good bet that Charles Carroll, the only Catholic signer of the Declaration, would have disagreed with Judge O'Malley. And Charles Carroll was no coward.

Flush tax
\
According to an article (The Capital, Jan. 27), our green friends are at it again, meeting with Democrat legislators to push for environmental legislation affecting several issues dear to their hearts.
\
When it comes to raising Maryland taxes, this naive gang lends support to a group of lawmakers who never meet a tax or fee they don't embrace.
\
The ""Enviros"" should get this idea through their mini-brains: No matter what any taxation bill purports to support, the revenue invariably finds its way into a general fund that gets used for something other than its intent.
\
Over the years, Maryland taxpayers have watched our legislators enact bills for Lotto and slots in which the revenue was targeted for schools, bills for gas-tax hikes targeted for highway construction, bills for special taxes for conservation projects, and on and on ad nauseam, but invariably the resources get shuttled to the general fund and used for projects more dear to legislators' hearts.
\
Instead of raising taxes targeted for improving our environment, why not skip the tax and fee increases and do something constructive as volunteers? We'll find it much cheaper.

335," GOV. ROBERT L. Ehrlich Jr. is right to be moving forward vigorously on construction of the Intercounty Connector. He campaigned for the road and was elected, in part, on the promise to build it.\ It is a good project. It will enhance the economy and quality of life of Central Maryland, and it has overwhelming public support, as a recent poll shows.\ Unfortunately, his administration's idea of how to pay for the $1.7 billion road is quite wrong. As reported in The Sun Dec. 11, the Ehrlich team has floated the idea of issuing hundreds of millions of dollars in ""grant anticipation revenue vehicle,"" or GARVEE, bonds to finance the ICC.\ Warren G. Deschenaux, director of the state's Office of Policy Analysis, is right in his claim that using the bonds would add greatly to the project's cost - perhaps $100 million. Worse, the bonds would take future federal transportation grant money away from other road and transit projects and direct it toward payment of the ICC's debt.\ New Jersey used GARVEE bonds to finance transportation infrastructure several years ago, with disastrous results. The state is now within 18 months of exhausting its entire transportation trust fund because that money has been redirected toward paying off rotten GARVEE bonds. That would leave not a cent for the purposes for which the trust fund was created - building and maintaining roads and transit. An expert panel has reported to the state's governor that a 12.5 cent increase in the state gasoline tax is needed to shore up the trust fund. Maryland surely does not want to go down that path.\ Indeed, it's possible that the state would not need to borrow to finance the ICC. In many places around the world, governments are turning to investors to bear the risks for major road projects; the investors are compensated through tolls.\ Last month, a 27-mile toll road called M6 Toll was opened in Birmingham, England. The road cost $1.3 billion - all of which was privately financed. In San Diego, State Route 125 South - a 10-mile toll road costing $635 million - is under construction. It is being built with some federal loan money, but the financing is basically from investors who have a 35-year toll franchise.\ In Australia, virtually all of the major new urban roads are privately financed toll roads. Toronto's new high-tech toll road is a private franchise that replaces cash tollbooths with highway- speed electronic toll collection. In France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Ireland, Greece and several East European countries, investors are financing roads. Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, India, Pakistan and even China are tapping private capital markets for toll roads.\ In the United States, Minnesota, Colorado, the Carolinas, Texas, Arkansas and Missouri are all inviting investors to finance major new road projects. Virginia has the privately financed Dulles Greenway and is considering about six other private projects - including one for the Capital Beltway and one for reconstructing Interstate 81 along the length of the state.\ Maryland does not need to put its taxpayers in hock and foreclose future gas tax monies to build the ICC. Instead, the state should commission a thorough traffic and revenue study to determine the potential of toll revenue financing.\ And the state should invite competitive private-sector proposals for financing the road so that the Assembly and the public can see what their options are. Motorists are prepared to pay for a good highway, especially now that bothersome toll plazas are no longer needed because of E-Z Pass-style transponders and cameras reading license plates.\ The revenue study may find that some government support is needed. Perhaps state and federal funding will be required to cover the costs of route selection and environmental permitting and work to mitigate the impact on the environment. The state might pay for some of the interchange work with connecting state highways.\ But it should be possible to have the bulk of the ICC's costs borne by investors based on the prospective toll revenue stream instead of putting all of the highway's expense on the back of taxpayers.\ Peter Samuel is a contributing scholar of the Maryland Public Policy Institute and is editor TOLLROADS- news, a Web-based news service."
336,"Gov. Parris N. Glendening made clear yesterday he is in no hurry to help the racetrack owners who spent more than a million dollars last year in what many saw as an attempt to unseat him.\In a wide-ranging talk with Sun editorial writers -- touching on sprawl, taxes, education and civil rights -- Glendening reserved his most pointed remarks for his political enemies in the racing industry.\The governor did not hide his irritation at their quest to legalize slot machines at tracks and their support of Republican Ellen R. Sauerbrey in the gubernatorial race. He put no money for horse racing in his proposed budget for the next fiscal year, and he said he would continue to withhold his support barring a change of position by the industry.\""As long as they hang on to this `only solution is slots' and all, they're not going to have a partner in the governor's office,"" Glendening said, adding later with a smile: ""They took a gamble and bet on the wrong horse.""\Glendening was particularly upset that racetrack owners spent between $1 million and $2 million on advertising for slots and pro- Republican causes last year just after he and legislators decided to give the owners $10 million in state aid, including $1.5 million to promote the industry.\""If they said they didn't even have enough money to promote the industry, and we give them $1.5 million, and then they spend $2 million promoting slots coming into Maryland, something's not right,"" said Glendening. ""A lot of the taxpayers resent that.""\Racetrack owners have known since last fall's election that their relationship with Glendening, a staunch opponent of slots, would be less than warm.\In the months leading up to the November election, Joseph A. De Francis, the majority owner of Pimlico and Laurel racecourses, spent more than $1 million on a television and direct-mail campaign for slot machines that many Democrats considered a thinly veiled attack on Glendening.\Near the end of the campaign, De Francis sent more than $200,000 to the Republican National Committee and prevailed upon Hilton Hotels Corp., owner of Bally's at Ocean Downs harness track near Ocean City, to give a similar amount to the national GOP. About the same time, the national Republican Party launched a major ad campaign on Sauerbrey's behalf here, though De Francis and the GOP denied there was a connection.\De Francis said yesterday he was not surprised by most of Glendening's comments.\""I would hope that any personal animosity that he might have because I supported his opponent -- as he said, I bet on the wrong horse -- wouldn't spill over into policy judgments that he makes as governor,"" De Francis said. He said he continues to support legalizing slots because he sees that as the elixir for Maryland's sluggish racing industry.\De Francis said that ""not one nickel"" of the state's racing aid helped pay for his advertising and political efforts, especially since his tracks have yet to receive their $1 million share of the $1.5 million in promotion money.\In his talk yesterday, Glendening had some spirited remarks about his anti-sprawl initiative called Smart Growth, which encourages growth near already developed areas.\After noting that the anti-sprawl issue has become something of a national cause, Glendening complained that some Maryland counties have not bought into the state's initiative.\Glendening said he will announce a decision by next week on whether he will pursue a gas tax increase this year or next year to fund transportation projects. Legislative leaders say they believe he has decided to wait until next year in order to build legislative support for such a tax increase.\The governor, who will be sworn in for his second term tomorrow, offered a preview of his inaugural and state-of-the-state speeches to come this week.\He said he will focus in his inaugural speech on three issues that the state must address in the coming years: education, the environment and inclusion and fairness. His state-of-the-state speech will also include his emphasis on funding education initiatives to spur economic development and his push to extend state civil rights protections to gays and lesbians.\Sun staff writer Thomas W.

337,"Mob rule in Baltimore\I came up from the D.C. suburbs to take part in the Saturday demonstration in support of the Baltimore Police Department. I confess I was afraid to do it but I did it (""Supporters of police rally in front of Baltimore City Hall,"" May 30). \Why did I do it? \Are those six police officers guilty of all the charges against them? Guilty of some? Innocent of everything? Are they guilty of a momentary professional lapse with tragic consequences? Of a professional judgment that went wrong? Guilty of being human? \I don't know. \What about Freddie Gray? Was he a cooperative prisoner? Or was he making trouble? Was he making it all about race? Resisting? Being belligerent? Being violent? \I don't know. \Freddie Gray should not have died, of course. But what is clear to me -- from the rhetoric of Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby and from race-baiter and divider extraordinaire Rev. Al Sharpton -- is that they are looking not for justice but to satisfy a mob by crucifying these six officers. When a community at large decides in advance that the accused is guilty and demands the ""right"" verdict and takes matters into their own hands to get it, that is not democracy. It is mob rule. It is a lynching. \Stephen Kosciesza, Silver Spring \Md. needs more group homes, too \I'm afraid the person who wrote the editorial regarding foster children (""A home of their own,"" June 3) has never worked in foster care. I did for 22 years as a worker and supervisor. Yes, it would be better for most children if they were raised in a family foster home or by relatives. However, from my experience, though there were many fine foster homes, there will never be enough foster homes or suitable relatives to care for neglected or abused children, especially pre-teens and adolescents. \Good professional group homes can fill the gap caused by a lack of sufficient numbers of family foster homes and relatives. From my experience, no matter how much you attempt to improve the number, quality and salary for foster homes, there will never be enough homes to meet the needs of foster children. We need more, not fewer, neighborhood group homes and specialized larger group homes run by highly trained staff and supervised by the state with more than adequate funding for salaries and facilities. \Albert Sherman, Baltimore \O'Malley would make a fine president \I supported Martin O'Malley when he was governor and I believe he would make a fine president ( ""O'Malley seeks path to White House,"" May 30). \As governor, Mr. O'Malley showed courage and vision by presiding over a truly progressive administration that avoided college tuition increases, strengthened gun control, abolished capital punishment and enacted marriage equality. \In addition his administration passed the Dream Act that helped young, promising undocumented students, embraced the Affordable Care Act and protected our environment. \What a glorious record! Yes, some taxes were increased. But taxes are the price we pay to live in a civilized society. It takes revenue to assure good schools, adequate health care, open green space, public safety and the host of other services that we all demand. \Thank goodness Mr. O'Malley displayed the courage needed to increase the gas tax. Now perhaps we can begin to repair our deteriorated roads, bridges and other infrastructure that are essential to attract jobs, grow our industries and assure that Maryland can compete successfully in the global economy. \Jack Kinstlinger, Towson \Give O'Malley credit for backbone \Former Gov. Martin O'Malley's run for the presidency has produced a steady trickle of reader letters denouncing him for raising taxes. I'm not Mr. O'Malley's biggest fan, but to my mind his willingness to brave the carping of the anti-tax crowd is a strong point in his favor (""Does O'Malley have what it takes to be president?"" May 31). \Paying taxes to meet public needs is a patriotic and civic duty, and levying taxes is too. As I watch the streets in my neighborhood crumbling week after week, read about failing bridges, some long past their projected life span, and contemplate the economic and human cost of our nationwide lack of adequate public transit, I can only hope that we will manage to elect a critical mass of politicians with the guts to apply the fiscal remedies we need before our country collapses into a giant sinkhole of decay and neglect. \Paul Romney, Baltimore\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"

Slots, taxes
\
The Maryland legislature would rather approve a referendum than vote on a bill regarding the voluntary contribution of our money, via slot machines, to the state treasury. The latest polls I've read show that most Marylanders are in favor of slots.
\
Yet the legislature is willing to vote on massive tax increases, which most Marylanders are against, to force an involuntary contribution to the state.
\
If the legislators won't cast a public vote for slots, and approve a referendum instead, they are in a win-win situation. Assuming the ballot item passes, they get the slots revenue they want with minimal risk, because they haven't cast votes on the record.
\
The legislators' job is to represent the citizens who voted them into office and cast those tough votes. Otherwise, Maryland might as well go to an all-referendum system and bypass the legislature altogether. How many hundreds of millions of dollars would that save?
\
Paying a handful of state employees a fair wage to field requests from the citizens and putting those requests up for popular vote should be far more cost-effective than paying to support the legislature and paying for the other expenses involved with running the State House. And wouldn't Election Day be much simpler?
\
But this is an unrealistic scenario, of course.
\
Why are only slots referendum-bound? Gov. Martin O'Malley proposed a bill to push taxes up, with slots included as a carrot, dangling there to encourage us to accept our fate. Slots were presented as part of a package, along with tax increases.
\
How about the voters getting a chance to vote on that entire package, slots and taxes, via this potential referendum? How about including a term-limits referendum for the legislators as well?

Stormwater
\
In Anne Arundel County, if you want to put a face on who is against saving the Chesapeake Bay, look at the outcome of the votes on stormwater at the Nov. 19 County Council meeting.
\
Each drop of water running from our homes, businesses, schools, farms, churches, shopping centers and roads finds its way to the little creeks nearby, then into larger streams, then into rivers and finally into the bay.
\
This low-quality and high-quantity water is laden with pollutants that can't be filtered and can't be absorbed into the ground and the groundwater. It is both destroying aquatic life in these waterways and carrying off soil as it goes, depositing both in the bay.
\
The Chesapeake Bay system is dying. Like global warming, it is a fact. The alarming thing is that we're not doing much about it.
\
Stormwater legislation proposed by County Executive John R. Leopold rightly aims to restore streams in 340 county subwatersheds that need restoration after years of development. His proposal is to raise $5 million a year solely from ""new"" construction.
\
The magnitude of the problem created by existing ""old"" construction warrants a fund of at least $10 million a year coming from all of us property owners who are responsible for today's stormwater crisis.
\
Restorations that will each cost from the hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars are the only way to save our creeks, rivers and the bay for our children and grandchildren.
\
To see who talks about the bay and who votes for it, tune into county cable television on Nov. 19 at 7 p.m. or, better yet, come to the Arundel Center in Annapolis and watch it live.

Tax reform
\
Gov. Martin O'Malley has offered a modest proposal to deal with the structural deficit, but it is only the first step. The General Assembly should take prompt action to eliminate the structural deficit and adopt a fair revenue plan to address unmet health, environment and education needs.
\
The keystone of the governor's proposal is a more progressive income tax, which should be approved.
\
The governor's large sales tax increase may drive consumers away from Maryland retailers to tax-free Internet shopping. A better approach would be elimination of existing sales tax exemptions.
\
Higher gas taxes would fund deferred transportation needs and encourage people to use smaller, more efficient vehicles. The governor's proposed gas tax increase is quite small but includes a desirable inflation adjustment to keep up with rising transportation construction costs.
\
The governor's proposed reduction in the state property tax is misplaced. The Board of Public Works should continue to set the state property tax rate as needed to retire state debt. This would continue the state's outstanding bond rating and low debt costs.
\
The governor's slot machine proposal is a disappointment and should be defeated either by the General Assembly or at referendum. There should be no state subsidy for horse racing, which should succeed or fail like other businesses.

Anne Arundel County might want to look outside our own box, and see how southern California camouflaged its cell towers to look like tall evergreen trees. Not the total solution, but an alternative.

How convenient it is to forget, Annapolis and this region have a unique natural beauty, which makes up the fabric of our so-called ""lifestyle."" Builders come in from outside, at the expense of us all, and constantly chip away at our beauty, under the guise of more jobs. We continue to ""sell ourselves,"" for a few pieces of silver.

Discrimination
\
Why should invective be used as argumentation? I have learned from your paper that I suffer from homophobia. I have been aware from almost all my life, that I suffer from femophylia, a condition that I am told affects 97 percent of men.
\
Fortunately, I married a remarkable woman who has helped me to keep this condition in check, and as a fringe benefit, has provided me with wonderful sons and daughters.
\
But I am concerned about a much more serious discrimination: the enormous difference in income between college graduates and the rest of the people. I believe we need a law that will grant a bachelor degree to every citizen of this country, a BA to those who attend college, and a BS to the others. After this, every difference in income will be proof positive of unfair discrimination.

Gas tax
\
Through our gas taxes, we paid into the transportation fund. This fund has been depleted because of fiscal diversion by the state. Now we are expected to become enablers to this mishandling by replenishing this fund by an increase in our gasoline tax.
\
With gasoline prices rising in leaps and bounds, to tack on 10 cents a gallon tax for this reason at this time is the most asinine act imaginable. No thought, consideration or compassion has been given to wage earners with families, making $10 or $15 an hour, driving older cars because they can't afford newer ones that get decent mileage, and cannot take public transportation because it is unreliable or completely unavailable to get from point A to point B.
\
This would not have an impact on me as I am 84 years old, retired and can minimize the driving I do, nor will it impact anyone in my family. I am active, alert, aware and live in the world of reality.
\
I am very aware of the plight of many struggling young families who will be severely impacted by this. Members of the General Assembly, wake up! Look around you and you, too, may see the world as it is. Don't make us enablers to this fiscal mismanagement.

Comment
\
I've been following the debate over gay marriage in Maryland and have observations - all stemming from the basic history I learned in high school.
\
First, it's obvious the legislators don't understand that we live in a ""democratic republic."" That means they are elected to their positions by popular vote (Democratic) but they are assumed to be more learned than we, and make difficult decisions accordingly (Republic). Taking months or years to poll constituents, or call for referendum, indicates they have missed the ""republic"" part.
\
Second, I recall our legislators' brave history of making decisions that were widely unpopular at the time - decisions they believed would be the right things to do. These are things like passing highly unpopular civil rights legislation in the 1960s. If today's legislators faced that question today they would manage to put off the vote for years, while they polled their constituents. Simply doing the right thing would be too hard.
\
And lastly, I wonder if the legislators have read anything about our separation of church and state. When Del. Don Dwyer celebrated his victory in stemming of equal rights for a group of citizens he exclaimed, ""To God be the glory."" Does he have any idea how fanatical that sounded? I'd expect to hear something like that from an ayatollah, not an elected delegate in this country.

"
340," WASHINGTON -- The House overwhelmingly approved a landmark, $151 billion transportation bill last night that would give states unprecedented authority to spend federal highway aid on mass transit projects.\ The 343-83 vote provided a margin substantially more than that needed to override the veto President Bush has threatened.\ The controversial, six-year package would set the course for national highway and mass transit policy into the 21st century and would, for the first time in 35 years, restructure the way that the federal government hands out aid for roads, bridges, bus systems and rail lines.\ Support for the measure was solid among both Democrats and Republicans, despite some lawmakers' opposition to a proposed extension of a gasoline tax surcharge and $5.2 billion in funding for ""demonstration projects"" in various districts.\ Maryland stands to gain about $160 million to purchase new rail cars for the Maryland Rail Commuter service, expand its parking facilities and possibly build a 14-mile spur from Point of Rocks to Frederick. Without the federal dollars, the state has only enough money to preserve the service it now provides.\ Early in the day, House members voted 323-102 to turn back a conservative Republican challenge to the, ground rules under which the bill was considered.\ To help pay for the massive public works program, the bill would extend for four years, until Sept. 30, 1999, a 2.5-cent-a-gallon surcharge on the federal gasoline tax that was enacted last year. The gasoline tax currently is 14 cents a gallon. The bill also calls for drastically reducing the $11.4 billion balance in the federal Highway Trust Fund's highway account over the next six years.\ Congressional supporters praised the bill, known as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Infrastructure Act of 1991, as a vital investment in an increasingly competitive international environment.\ But opponents, largely Republicans, attacked the proposed gas tax extension and what they characterized as the bill's emphasis on mass transit over highway construction.\ ""This is a Democrat bill, and it has a Democrat tax increase in it,"" said Representative Dick Armey, R-Texas.\ Opponents also assailed $5.2 billion in funds earmarked for specially designated ""congressional projects of national significance.""\ The so-called demonstration projects have been widely criticized by the Bush administration and others as pork-barrel spending intended to boost representatives' popularity.\ ""We need to get the pork out to control the deficit,"" Representative Dan Burton, R-Ind., said as lawmakers neared a vote on the bill.\ The president's senior advisers, including Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner, have said they will recommend a veto of the bill on several grounds.\ The administration also objects to the bill's proposed federal-state ratio of 80 percent to 20 percent for highway and transit projects. Mr. Skinner had sought to double the state contribution to 40 percent.\ The House legislation would largely replace programs put in place in 1956 that were designed to finance construction of the 43,000-mile interstate highway network, which is now all but complete. The bill includes $8 billion to complete the remaining interstate threads.\ The bill would authorize $119 billion in spending on a variety of highway and bridge programs through the 1997 fiscal year and $32 billion for mass transit, more than double the amount of transit spending proposed by the administration. It also would give states the authority to shift up to $51 billion of the highway funds into transit programs.\ The previous transportation authorization bill expired Sept. 30, and Mr. Skinner said that failure to pass replacement legislation could cost more than 100,000 jobs and delay many local projects.\ The Senate in June approved its own transportation bill, which calls for spending $123 billion over five years, including at least $21 billion on transit projects. The Senate bill would permit even more flexibility than the House legislation, creating a $45 billion surface transportation program that could be used for either highway or transit projects.\ The differences between the measures must be worked out by a House-Senate conference committee.\ Transportation bill\ House measure would:\ * Earmark $119 billion for highways and $32 billion for mass transit.\ * Create a $76.7 billion highway program in which states would have the option of transferring up to two-thirds of the money to mass transit.\ * Establish a 155,000-mile National Highway System composed of the 44,000-mile interstate systems and other major primary roads. Financing of the system is set at $37.6 billion over six years, a total the Bush administration says is inadequate.\ * Earmark $5 billion for 460 road-building projects in the congressional districts of 227 House members.\ * Authorize $8 billion to complete the interstate system.\ * Encourage the building of toll highways by permitting a 35 percent federal contribution to their cost.\ * Authorize $14.9 billion to repair and replace obsolete and deteriorated bridges.\ * Order a freeze on the expansion of triple-trailer trucks outside of the states in which they are now permitted.\ Maryland votes\ Here is how the Maryland delegation voted on the highway and mass transit authorization bill approved yesterday by the House.\ A ""yes"" vote is a vote to pass the bill. Democrats Beverly B. Byron, 6th YES Benjamin L. Cardin, 3rd YES Steny H. Hoyer, 5th YES Tom McMillen, 4th NO Kweisi Mfume, 7th YES Republicans Helen Delich Bentley, 2nd YES Wayne T.

341,"Is Mayor Pugh trying to drive out the millennials?\Listening to a few vocal bicycle NIMBYs instead of following her own transition report, Mayor Catherine Pugh carelessly consented to remove the protected bike lane on Potomac Street (""City plans to tear out protected bike lane on Potomac Street in Canton,"" June 8).\As a millennial with disposable income and the privilege to choose where I live, one of the primary reasons I stay in Baltimore City is the ability to walk and bike for live, work and play. If I wanted more parking, I would simply move to the county where the job opportunities, taxes, crime and education all work in my favor. The city's advantage is its diversity in both people and built environment.\There are more residents like me than the mayor seems to think. Recent additions to the city including Bikeshare and the Maryland and Potomac protected bike lanes keep us excited and help keep us here.\We even have conversations about how bike lanes may substitute for empty suburban streets once we have children. Behind the woodwork, there are more residents, especially women, attracted to a car-free lifestyle but who fear the possibility of death and injury due to a dearth of safe and protected bike lanes - something the Potomac Street installation began to fix.\Baltimore's bike infrastructure pales in comparison to Washington, Boston, and other cities of similar size - cities I that could choose to move to and cities that Baltimore should compete with. And cycling lanes aren't just about young professionals; they provide a transit option for one-third of the city's residents who don't drive, they increase access for Baltimore's most disadvantaged residents who lack vehicular access, and they encourage physical activity.\Mayor Pugh has put cars over residents and set a precedent to remove more bike infrastructure; reducing Baltimore's competitive advantage with the suburbs and its ability to compete with other cities for new residents. Given her lack of comment, she may think this decision is just a fender bender.\But removing the protected lane will result in fatality: driving millennials out of Baltimore City.\Maria-Josefina Fernandez, Baltimore\Trump infrastructure plan\ is woefully inadequate\I was fascinated by Peter Morici's column in which he advises the Republican Party how to become effective despite the machinations of President Donald Trump (""How Republicans can survive Trump,"" June 10). Perhaps a more useful subject would have been how America can survive Trump. \I was perplexed to read the statement in the column that despite missteps by the White house in other areas, expertise is being displayed in the area of infrastructure. As an expert in transportation, I have been astounded at the naivete and lack of vision in the infrastructure plan presented so far by the Trump administration.\Updating the air traffic control system through privatization has been considered by Congress for many years and repeatedly defeated because it would unduly favor the larger hub airports and major airlines to the detriment of smaller carriers and airports and our more rural communities. It is unlikely to fare any better this time around.\Solving the critical need to upgrade our roads and bridges in large part through private investments as proposed in the Trump infrastructure plan does not begin to address the problem. Private investments can play a role in the solution, and they have done so for decades, but that role is severely limited. Toll roads and bridges will attract private investors, but they work only with heavy traffic flows where toll revenues are substantial. America's heavy travel corridors are already served by toll roads and toll bridges or by free Interstate highways. The greater need for investments is in maintenance and repair and additional roads and bridges in less dense areas. Private investments and toll revenues are not feasible in those instances. \The only reasonable way to bring our deficient highway system into the 21st century is to increase the gas tax, which is essentially a user fee, or to levy some other form of user fee for the use of our roads and bridges. Most transportation experts support that solution. That was how improvements were financed for generations in a bipartisan and noncontroversial manner. But I fear the insane antipathy of the Republican leadership to any form of tax increase makes that eminently reasonable solution out of the question. I do not expect the Trump infrastructure plan to bring any solution to our infrastructure problems.\Jack Kinstlinger, Towson\Service academies are a terrible deal for taxpayers\In response to Bruce Fleming's article about the excessive cost of service academies (""Naval Academy graduates no better than the civilians they defend,"" June 5), he presents a valid fact.\It cost three times the amount to produce an officer at an academy versus one produced by a ROTC or OCS program. As Mr. Fleming says, the product is essentialy the same; there is no proof disputing this fact.\As a consumer if you were purchasing a house, would you purchase the same exact house for three times the amount, when the one next door is only a third of the cost?\J.E. Michalski, Baltimore"
342,"No fracking in Western Md.\I read with great interest the editorial, ""Fracking still worrisome"" (Oct. 8). I live in Western Maryland, and I don't understand why we're having this debate. \Fracking for natural gas in Western Maryland will not help America become energy- independent. We simply do not have oil and gas reserves that make that possible. What is even more concerning is that gas operators don't want to sell this gas locally or even distribute it in the United States. They want to sell it overseas. \The state of Maryland commissioned several studies to determine if fracking posed unacceptable risks. They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, they have not yet decided what constitutes unacceptable risk. Unacceptable risk should be very well defined, measurable and quantifiable. It should have been defined before any of the studies were done. It should clearly and unambiguously indicate whether the results of the studies indicate if the risks are unacceptable. Otherwise, studies are pointless. \The results of the Health Impact Assessment state that overall there will be a medium negative impact to the health of Western Marylanders. It doesn't tell us what those impacts are (for example, cancer, emphysema, asthma, etc.) but it does say that our current health care infrastructure will be overwhelmed. That means that lots of people are going to get sick and be financially damaged. That alone should indicate that the risks are unacceptable. \The economic study wasn't able to conclude that the local economy would improve. It was not certain new jobs for locals would be created or what effect it might have on tourism or whether real estate values might decrease. What is clear is that local communities will have to pay for more local infrastructure including health care, schools, road repair, police and for various kinds of emergencies . \It is also clear fracking will cause environmental damage, especially to water. It has happened everywhere fracking is allowed and it can't be stopped. It is unrealistic to expect otherwise. \Why should we shoulder the burden? We're going to get sick, our environment damaged and there'll be no improvement to the local economy. Local government is going to have to find lots of money to pay for additional health care infrastructure, police, schools and road repair. Most of that money will be provided by local tax increases. All of this is documented both by the studies done by the state or by the experience of communities where fracking is currently taking place. \What's the rush? That gas isn't going anywhere. When we've learned how to extract it so that it doesn't harm anything and benefits all instead of a few, then we can get it. Until then, let's do the best we can with what we've got and be thankful that we're not going to suffer the kinds of things that other communities have to endure. \Jim Guy, Oldtown \What Brown should say about taxes \In his letter, ""What Brown isn't saying about taxes"" (Oct. 9), J. Michael Collins of Reisterstown complains about higher gasoline taxes enacted by the O'Malley-Brown administration and asks ""When is The Sun going to call Brown out ... on what he and [Gov. Martin] O'Malley have done,"" with the effect of these taxes? \I'll tell you what they have done, Mr. Collins. They are building a third northbound lane on Route 29 in Howard County where I live to ease what has become a slow-rolling parking lot every afternoon at rush hour. This is a project planned for many years but never begun due to lack of money, partly caused by the greatest economic downturn our nation has seen since the Great Depression. Another cause was the General Assembly's refusal to raise the gas tax for more than 20 years. \Highway and other transportation improvements were in desperate need of funds that they are now getting. \I recoup the higher price of gas each week by using the points I get from my local supermarket to get 10-to-50 cents a gallon off. And the price of gas is now dipping every week. \When my wife and I rode the light rail to the Inner Harbor recently to see the Blue Angels perform, we paid $1 each to ride as seniors. That's a huge bargain. \What the O'Malley-Brown administration has done for voters -- despite constant Republican carping -- is build a better, stronger Maryland for all of us to enjoy, and I, for one, appreciate it! \Larry Carson, Columbia \Sun's criticism of Hogancomes as no surprise \So now we have the two biggest ""liars"" in the state running for the state's highest office, according to The Sun, but I don't think Larry Hogan is a liar (""The limits of 'truthiness,'"" Oct. 9). \But we certainly know who this newspaper will endorse automatically and without thinking in the coming election. It's amazing how this paper will -- election after election and no matter who is running -- pick the person that will hurt the state the most. I wonder if your predecessors at the Sun in the 1860s would have backed Honest Abe. \He, of course, was a Republican, so I doubt it, knowing the Sun couldn't have changed that much in only 150 years. \Norman Wolfe, Pikesville\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
343," Gas Tax\ I was several paragraphs into John Shlaes' letter (April 12) about the carbon tax before I realized that his Global Climate Coalition might better be called the ""Gas Guzzler Coalition.""\ The following quote speaks for itself: ""The latest data indicates {sic} that warming temperatures will not lead to a rise in sea level, in part because the warming would occur primarily at night.""\ Does he think that global warming is a night-time phenomenon? Some of his other comments are equally questionable and almost as amusing.\ He is correct that a carbon tax would mean higher prices for fuels such as oil and gas; that's the point of the tax.\ The tax would also mean the introduction of efficient market forces to make our economy use these fuels more effectively.\ That would represent a long-term benefit to our economy, our environment and all of us. Rob Bonney Pasadena\ National Debt\ Harry B. Howe's April 13 letter disputes my contention that Social Security benefits are, indeed, income.\ My Funk & Wagnall's defines income as ""amount of money coming in"" -- which would certainly seem to include Social Security checks.\ Obviously, Mr. Howe believes that half the benefits he receives were already taxed once and that ""it is the same as if you put money in a bank account.""\ Why is it that when I put money in the bank, I am not allowed to withdraw anything beyond what I put in, plus a little taxable interest?\ My bank will not let me continue to withdraw money for as long as I live. It will not allow my surviving spouse to keep on drawing money until her demise.\ It will not pay me benefits during my working years, if I should become disabled. It does not pay survivor benefits to my dependents. Nor dies it try to protect me during my retirement years from the ravages of inflation with regular cost-of-living adjustments.\ Social Security does all of these things -- and it continues to do them long after I and the vast majority of retirees have exhausted the amount initially paid into the system.\ Mr. Howe may feel comfortable in bequeathing a $16,000 debt to each of his grandchildren, which is growing.\ But I (and, I hope, many other seniors) would be willing to try to live within my means, sacrificing a little, in order that our children and grandchildren might enjoy some of the benefits we did, rather than struggle with the burden resulting from our irresponsible selfishness. F. van Dommelen Denton\ White Males\ In Wayne Hardin's April 12 article, Dr. Charles T. Lo Presto attempts to paint all white males as frustrated, mad individuals who are going off the deep end.\ He bases this assumption on a movie, ""Falling Down,"" in which Michael Douglas, facing some life failures, shoots up the town.\ As David Letterman said about Dan Quayle's remarks about the Murphy Brown episode, ""It's just a movie, Charles, it's make believe.""\ His attempt to psychoanalyze the entire white male population on the basis of a movie theme is laughable.\ Dr. Larry Iacarino states that "". . . white males are starting to feel oppressed and will be held down the same way women and minorities were held down."" Do you have any data to support that hypothesis?\ Why do you single out white males? Are you aware of the ""us killing us is genocide"" theme being sung in the black community?\ General Dynamics, IBM, Westinghouse and numerous airlines have laid off thousands of people from very high-paying jobs. Can you cite one instance where one of these workers behaved as Michael Douglas had in the movie?\ Don't you guys think white males are capable of dealing with adversity? If you don't, try reading your history books. Julius G. Angelucci Severna Park\ Human Cowardice\ M. Catherine Kennedy writes about genetic engineering (April 5) that ""it is wrong to experiment with a product that will affect a significant number of people (and animals and plants) when the results for good or ill cannot be predicted.""\ What if Wilbur and Orville Wright had foreseen that airplanes would become weapons of mass destruction in World War II?\ What if Benjamin Franklin had known how many people would die of electrocution?\ What if our early ancestors, inventing the wheel, had guessed how many people would crash in automobiles or be burned to death by fire?\ Should these people all have given up their work in the name of kindness to humanity? Any technology will have good effects and ill effects.\ More Americans die every year from automobile accidents than died in the Vietnam war. Yet we choose to continue driving these dangerous vehicles because we think the benefits outweigh the dangers.\ Pharmaceuticals save a great many lives every year. The development of every pharmaceutical is a trial-and-error process. We test new drugs on animals because we don't know what the results will be. Many animals die.\ But if we halted the animal testing of drugs, or the development of new drugs, we would be condemning many of our own to dysfunction, pain and premature death.\ The challenge of being human, in technology as in anything else, is to guide our actions with intelligence. To say we should give up because of the dangers is not an act of kindness, but of cowardice. Philip Goetz Ellicott City"
344,"Gov.

Future sessions, scheduled through the fall, are to concentrate on education, health, public safety and the environment. \Later Wednesday, the governor enjoyed a moment on the national stage when he briefly addressed the crowd gathered in Washington for the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington. \In Maryland, O'Malley and his critics gave different interpretations of his record on jobs. \""Governor O'Malley is pretty good at weaving magical tales with no basis in reality,"" said Larry Hogan, chairman of Change Maryland. ""But no amount of false spin can change the cold hard fact that no other governor in Maryland history has ever lost as many jobs as Martin O'Malley."" \He cited statistics showing 218,741 unemployed in Maryland, an increase of 110,645 since O'Malley took office in January 2007. \O'Malley boasted of the state's No. 1 ranking in entrepreneurship in a U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey. He emphasized figures showing Maryland had recovered 94 percent of the jobs it lost in the recession and that its rate of job creation was higher than Virginia's over the past year. \The 94 percent figure was a bittersweet boast because it represented a slip from the previous month, when O'Malley could report 99 percent jobs recovery until a dismal July employment report set the state back. \""We had a bad month last month,"" O'Malley admitted. ""Hopefully next month will be better."" \The governor predicted robust job growth ahead as revenue from the recent gas tax increase rolls in. He said it would create more than 57,000 jobs over the next six years. \O'Malley praised his lieutenant governor and would-be successor as the struggle for the Democratic nomination for governor in 2014 gets under way. \""Anthony Brown has been an integral part of everything we've done in this administration,"" O'Malley said. \By shedding a favorable light on his administration, Smith said, O'Malley helps both Brown and himself. \""If Anthony Brown wins the governorship, that raises O'Malley's clout on the [presidential] campaign trail,"" Smith said. Brown is expected to face Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler and Del. Heather Mizeur of Montgomery County in the Democratic primary next June. \Donald F. Norris, chairman of the department of public policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, said the O'Malley events would play the triple role of promoting the governor's record in preparation for a presidential race, supporting Brown and preparing for the governor's final legislative session. \While the first half of the event Wednesday event was devoted to touting the O'Malley record, the second consisted of a discussion of what Maryland can do to foster economic growth and job creation. \The governor pointed to his administration's efforts to improve work force training and to help startup businesses secure investment capital. \""We need to do more. We need to educate at higher and better levels,"" the governor said. ""We have to innovate in ways that move those ideas out of the laboratories."" \Smith said the timing for the forums is just right for the governor. He said that attention will shift when the General Assembly returns to Annapolis in January. \Then, when the legislature adjourns in April, Smith said, the media will focus on the primary and the general election for his successor. \""O'Malley will be in effect old news,"" Smith said. \Michael.dresser@baltsun.com\Credit: The Baltimore Sun"
345," Finksburg dairy farmer Gary R. Brauning II realizes that educators, social program advocates and other groups are lobbying hard for tax increases to solve the state's financial problems.\ But the Farm Bureau president says they represent the views of a small minority, not the largest Carroll constituency -- the working middle class.\ ""I haven't talked to anyone who wants higher taxes,"" Brauning emphasized to Carroll lawmakers at a recent Farm Bureau legislative meeting. ""They can't handle it. Maybe the delegates and senators haven't heard that from enough people, with the loudmouths who want to raise taxes. Cut what you have to cut, but don't raise taxes.""\ On that point, Carroll's six legislators agree wholeheartedly. To a man, they say they oppose any tax increase in the 1992 General Assembly session to bail Maryland out of its financial hole (well, almost any increase -- they might support a county hotel tax).\ Budget and taxation issues are expected to dominate the 1992 session, which begins today, as the legislature addresses the latest $225 million shortfall in the current budget year and a projected $1.2 billion shortfall for fiscal 1993. The county commissioners are waiting for the decisions so they can form their own plans.\ A number of Carroll educators have written letters urging the legislators to find ways to avoid cuts in education and further reductions in local aid. The county Board of Education supports making the tax system more equitable -- and thereby raising more revenue.\ But Carroll legislators say the talk they hear on the street, at meetings and in their offices is nearly unanimous in support of Brauning's views.\ Tough choices that could lead to thousands of layoffs at the state and county levels, elimination of government programs and reductions in previously untouchable areas such as education and police protection -- or alternatively, tax increases -- promise to make the next three months unpleasant, say Carroll legislators.\ ""I'm sure before the session is over, I may not be very popular,"" said Sen. Charles H. Smelser, D-Carroll, Frederick, Howard, a member of the influential Senate Budget and Taxation Committee. ""I didn't go there 33 years ago to win a popularity contest. I'll continue to do what I think is right.""\ Smelser said he is committed to ""downsizing"" government. The other Carroll legislators support that position. Smelser is evaluating the budget, department by department, position by position.\ ""There's too much bureaucracy,"" he said. ""We've built so much in, it's so much more difficult to reduce. As far as I'm concerned, everything is on the table.""\ That means that mandated programs, such as welfare and the previously established increases in state aid for education, could be adjusted.\ A $623 million tax increase plan has been proposed by the Budget and Taxation chairman that would extract more income tax from those earning more than $100,000, raise the sales tax from 5 percent to 6 percent, repeal some sales tax exemptions and apply the tax to additional services and increase the gas tax by 5 cents per gallon.\ But Carroll legislators say they consider those measures unwise in a recession.\ ""People can't tolerate any more taxes,"" said Delegate Donald B. Elliott, R-Carroll, Howard.\ Delegate Lawrence A. LaMotte, D-Carroll, Baltimore, is the one delegation member who says he could be swayed to support a tax increase, but only if the general public demonstrates an about-face on the issue.\ He says that the ""social contract"" -- the implicit agreement in which citizens entrust government to improve the quality of life and assist the downtrodden -- has been broken.\ ""We've got a group that doesn't care about anything except themselves,"" he said. ""They wouldn't want a tax increase under any circumstances. I think that group used to be a lot smaller, but now a growing segment could care less about the poor, the sick, the environment.""\ But some see many government programs as a waste of their hard-earned money. People like Bob Logue, owner of Bob's Welding in Taylorsville, who challenged the legislators at the Farm Bureau meeting to ""do something about all these people with all these food stamps.""\ ""If we didn't give all this money away to these people, maybe we wouldn't need a tax increase,"" he said. ""Let them get out and work a little.""\ Though they will be overshadowed by budget decisions, other important issues will be debated, among them redistricting.\ Carroll legislators are pleased with the new boundaries for state representation recommended by a governor's advisory committee. They expect the governor to submit a plan today that creates an entire senatorial district within the county and adds one more delegate with a Carroll residence.\ They say they don't anticipate the plan being changed by the legislature, which has 45 days to do so.\ ""This plan gives us a little more influence,"" said Delegate Richard N. Dixon, D-Carroll.\ The redrawing of the 47 districts takes place every 10 years following the latest census.\ The majority of the Carroll delegation also is expected to oppose a Schaefer administration measure to ban the sale or possession of certain ""assault"" weapons."
346,"During the past 90 days, Maryland lawmakers have debated a copious number of bills, ranging in topic from making soft-shell crab the official state sandwich to whether soldiers under the age of 21 can buy their own guns.\Some bills never made their way out of committee, while others were ushered through the House and Senate chambers before they'll be laid beneath the governor's pen as soon as this week.\In total, about 317 bills will move on to become law later this year -- less than one-third of the 1,075 bills introduced in the Senate and not quite one-fifth of the 1,535 proposed in the House of Delegates.\Many legislators will call the session a success, touting the passage of a wind farm off of Ocean City, repeal of the death penalty and some of the nation's strictest gun-control measures. But some Lower Shore officials, many of them Republicans in a predominantly Democratic state, have a different opinion.\""It's been horrendous what's transpired between the fees and the difficult bills,"" said Delegate Charles Otto, R-38A-Somerset, specifically referring to the $1.50 per month subsidy in the wind bill and the gas tax increase.\When analyzing the votes for the statewide and local bills, it's easy to notice the formation of alliances that are rarely as simple as party affiliation.\Specifically, the eight legislators from districts 37 and 38 formed differing blocs on major bills and their amendments.\The vote to repeal the death penalty was largely one-sided. Delegate Rudolph Cane, D-37A-Wicomico, was the only delegate or state senator from the Lower Shore to support repealing capital punishment.\The wind vote was divided along party lines. Democratic Delegates Cane and Norman Conway, D-38B-Wicomico, and Sen. Jim Mathias, D-38-Worcester, voted for the bill, while Republican Delegates Adelaide Eckardt, Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio, Mike McDermott and Charles Otto, and Sen. Richard Colburn, R-37-Dorchester, voted against the bill.\The gun vote united the Lower Shore representatives, who all voted against the Firearms Safety Act of 2013.\McDermott may have been one of the loudest voices against the gun bill, giving boisterous speeches in the House and making evening trips back to the district to attend pro-gun rallies.\""This was not so much a partisan bill as it was a geographic bill,"" McDermott said after final passage in the House. ""In the urban environment of the cities, they associate guns with violent acts committed against people. When you are out in the country, guns are associated with traditions or family activities; culturally, we couldn't be any more opposite in how we view firearms.""\Local legislation\Sponsorship and co-sponsorship of county-specific bills and amendments varied as well, highlighting the uniqueness of each legislative district.\Among those proposed bills were:\* plans to give Wicomico County residents the option to purchase growlers of beer from restaurants and some stores;\* granting of authority to the state Board of Public Works to give up to $300,000 to the Hudson family for legal bills;\* and a change when the last drink can be poured at Ocean Downs Casino from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m.\Some of those bills have passed easily, while others took compromise and still wait for final floor votes today.\One bill Mathias spent the last few days promoting and could spend today working to pass moves up the day when Worcester County bars and restaurants can go to the free market for their liquor from July 1, 2016, to July 1, 2014. It also clarifies when and how the Worcester County Department of Liquor control can buy certain spirits and would give Ocean Downs two more hours to pour drinks.\""We are still waiting for the final outcome,"" Mathias said. ""That liquor bill has been really significant work, effort and compromise.""\Another Mathias-sponsored bill to study moving the start of the school year to after Labor Day also waits for final votes today.\One piece of local legislation that failed to gain majority support would have raised the ceiling on how many barrels of beer Evolution Craft Brewery can produce a year to 60,000 from 22,500.\Co-owner Tom Knorr said in the next two or three years, that production will be as high as it can go under the Class 7 brewpub licenses. At that time, he said, Evo would have to get rid of the restaurant and tasting room or level off sales of six packs and growlers.\Earlier this year, Knoor said if it didn't pass, he'd advocate for the change again next year.\Another local bill that didn't meet success during this session was a proposal by McDermott to repeal the Sustainable Growth and Preservation Act of 2013, commonly called the septic bill.\For the bills that receive final passage by midnight tonight, the governor's signature will be the next step before taking effect on July 1 or Oct. 1 of this year.\On the latter date, the soft-shell crab sandwich, thanks to a bill introduced by Colburn and Cane at the start of the session, will become the official state sandwich.\Joining the official state exercise of walking and the white oak as the state tree, the sandwich, which is basically a fried crab between two slices of bread, will become an official symbol of the Free State.\jshutt@dmg.gannett.com410-845-4643On Twitter: @JenniferShutt\ID_Code: A7-304080012"
347," ANNAPOLIS -- Legislative leaders who had feared that an angry Gov. William Donald Schaefer might bury them in a blizzard of vetoed legislation seemed relieved yesterday when his list of vetoed bills turned into little more than a mild flurry of gubernatorial rejection.\ Mr. Schaefer signed into law 209 bills, including major reform of the state's open meetings law. He vetoed only 11 bills (plus one line-item capital appropriation) for policy reasons, none of them likely to prompt the General Assembly to mount a veto-override campaign. In a subtle protest, he also let the legislature's budget-balancing tax increase go into effect without his signature.\ The vetoes included a bill that would have permitted speed limits on rural interstate highways to be raised to 65 mph -- a measure Mr. Schaefer said would lead to more traffic fatalities and serious injuries and would mean the use of more gasoline at a time when fuel should be conserved.\ Also vetoed were measures to permit foot doctors to treat ankle injuries; to provide a $500,000 subsidy to keep in operation the Lida Lee Tall Learning Resources Center at Towson State University; and to permit the Department of the Environment to impose administrative penalties on sewage treatment plants that are in significant violation of discharge limits.\ The governor also vetoed a bill that would require the state government to print on both sides of sheets of paper whenever duplicating or photocopying 10 or more pages. Mr. Schaefer praised the intent of the legislation but said it might be unworkable as drafted, and he promised to address the paper-conservation issue with an executive order.\ House Speaker R. Clayton Mitchell Jr., D-Kent, and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., D-Prince George's, agreed that they saw no evidence of retaliatory vetoes from a governor they knew had been unhappy with the legislature for killing so many of his bills.\ ""I think he had justification for all his vetoes,"" Mr. Mitchell said, although he added that he did not necessarily agree with the governor's decisions. ""I don't see any {moves to override} at this point.""\ Mr. Miller said he believed that the governor had gone out of his way to avoid override fights. The only measure he said was even a candidate for an override was a bill to prohibit state employees who move into private business from benefiting financially from their prior connections with the state.\ While much of the focus was on what Mr. Schaefer vetoed, the 209 bills he signed into law included measures to give teachers a greater say in the setting of educational or other standards for their profession and to establish 1,310 acres of state land in eastern Baltimore County as the North Point State Park and the Black Marsh Wildland.\ In all, Mr. Schaefer now has signed 667 bills enacted by the 1991 General Assembly; let three others go into effect without his signature; vetoed 11 for policy reasons; and vetoed 83 others because they were duplicates of bills he had signed.\ Showing his displeasure with the legislature's rejection of his own proposal to restructure the state's system of taxation, the governor refused to sign a bill passed by the General Assembly that raises $90 million in higher cigarette and capital gains taxes.\ ""The need for tax reform is still there. The need for a gas tax {increase} is still there. To delay it just puts something off that could have been handled in the first year of this administration,"" he said. ""This bill really doesn't solve any of the problems.""\ He said he vetoed the bill involving administrative penalties for sewage discharge violations because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency indicated that an amendment to the bill was inconsistent with the federal Clean Water Act and could jeopardize future federal funds.\ He vetoed the podiatry bill, he said, because of opposition from orthopedic surgeons, and because contradictory claims convinced him it would be prudent to take a more cautious approach. He said he has directed the state health department to look into the issue and develop a proposal.\ Provisions of open meetings law\ Among the bills signed into law yesterday by Gov. William Donald Schaefer was Senate Bill 170, which strengthens Maryland's existing open meetings law.\ Here are several of its major provisions:\ * Has a delayed effective date of July 1, 1992.\ * Creates a new three-member Open Meetings Compliance Board to determine whether the law has been violated.\ * The Open Meetings Compliance Board is to develop a program to educate the public about the law.\ * Permits a civil penalty of up to $100 against any member of a public body who knowingly and willfully participates in an illegally closed meeting of the body.\ * Expands provisions of the current open meetings law to cover the meetings of any public body that is granting a license or permit, or is involved in a zoning matter.\ * Stipulates that all or part of a public meeting may be videotaped, televised, photographed, broadcast or recorded, consistent with reasonable rules adopted by the public body.\ * Permits public bodies to meet in closed sessions for a variety of specific reasons, including ""performance evaluations"" of employees or others.\ * Deletes a previous exemption that permitted public bodies to close meetings for any reason as long as two-thirds of the members voted to do so."

No matter how you compute it, the cost of driving is going up.
\
On Wednesday, state budget analysts told lawmakers in Annapolis that they should raise the per-gallon gasoline tax, create a new 6 percent sales tax on gas sales, or hiking other taxes and fees.
\
Then on Thursday, the Maryland Transportation Authority board tentatively agreed to increase tolls drivers pay to cross the Bay Bridge, Baltimore tunnels and other facilities starting Nov. 1.
\
Even businesses, often the first to complain whenever the subject of higher taxes or fee seem ready for the increases.
\
Maryland Chamber of Commerce Vice President Allyson Black, calling Wednesday for an array of tax and fee increases before the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee, said: ""Transportation is the lifeblood of the Maryland economy.""
\
She said her organization supports raising tolls, gas taxes and vehicle registration fees, but with a caveat: There must be a constitutional amendment to keep the governor and the General Assembly from transferring money from the Transportation Trust Fund to the general treasury.
\
""A constitutional amendment is the most sure and secure fire wall,"" she said.
\
The most immediate change, pending a final vote next week, will be in the form of tolls:
\
The Bay Bridge toll will rise from $2.50 to $4 in November and $6 in July 2013.
\
Tolls for the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, the Fort McHenry Tunnel and the Francis Scott Key Bridge will go to $3 on Nov. 1, and $4 on July 1, 2013.
\
Tolls for the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway and the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge on Route 40 between Havre de Grace and Perryville will go to $6 on Nov. 1, and $8 in July 2013.
\
Rates for Bay Bridge also will apply to the Gov. Harry W. Nice Bridge, which crosses the Potomac River from Charles County, linking the state with Virginia.
\
E-ZPass rates also will increase on the Bay Bridge, to $3.60 in November and to $5.40 in 2013.
\
More increases
\
Gov. Martin O'Malley has said the state needs to raise another $800 million each year because the transportation system is ""on the verge of financial collapse.""
\
State officials proposed the toll increases earlier this year, saying current revenues are not sufficient for maintaining the state's transportation infrastructure. Also, additional funds are needed to pay back the money the state has borrowed for transportation projects.
\
In 2007, the state owed $806 million for transportation bonds. Now, it owes $2.3 billion, and will owe $2.7 billion in 2014, according to Maryland Transportation Authority reports.
\
In June, the MdTA announced it was considering increasing the Bay Bridge toll to $5 on Oct. 1 and $8 in July 2013. But a public outcry against this and other proposed toll hikes caused the board to trim the amounts.
\
Other long-term solutions to the money crunch include even more road and bridge tolls, state Department of Legislative Service analysts said, and areas such as Montgomery and Prince George's counties and Baltimore City and surrounding counties could levy local sales taxes for funding mass transit systems.
\
The underlying problem, witnesses told Senators, is that the state last increased the gas tax in 1992, even though construction and maintenance expenditures have been increasing constantly. The tax rate has been 23.5 cents per gallon for gasoline, and 24.25 cents per gallon for diesel fuel, for 19 years.
\
Adding to the problem: The federal government likely will contribute less to state transportation projects in coming years. The House of Representatives has proposed reducing federal aid to state transportation projects by 35 percent, which would cost Maryland about $170 million a year.
\
""This is the new environment, the uncertainty it represents for states like Maryland,"" senior policy analyst Jonathan Martin said.
\
Increasing the fuel tax by 10 cents per gallon would raise an additional $314 million each year, analysts said, while creating a new 6 percent sales tax on fuel sales would generate about $672 million annually.
\
""The primary advantage of applying a sales tax to motor fuel is that it would allow revenues to increase with inflation,"" analyst Stanford Ward said.
\
Six states, including California and New York, plus part of Virginia, have such taxes, Ward said.
\
Another option would be to increase by 50 percent vehicle registration fees, which currently range from $50.50 to $76.50 yearly. The increase would generate $165 million each year.
\
This year, the state will receive $3.7 billion in transportation revenues, of which the federal government will provide $770 million. The next largest source, the motor fuel tax, will generate $738 million.
\
The Transportation Trust Fund was created in 1971; since 1982, the General Assembly has taken money from the fund 12 times. These amounts totaled about $671 million, according to Department of Transportation records.
\
About half of the 12 withdrawals were made because of budget shortfalls, but $37.5 million went to buy new State Police helicopters and $100 million went to repay savings and loan customers hurt in the 1985-86 savings and loan crisis.
\
The general fund has reimbursed the Transportation Trust Fund about $453 million of the borrowed money, with another $68 million to be repaid before the current fiscal year expires at the end of June.
\
Of special concern to local jurisdictions over the past decade or so: The state has failed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars it normally would have given to counties and municipalities for transportation projects.
\
It's uncertain whether the General Assembly will take up the Transportation Trust Fund during the special session slated for late October, or hold off until the regular session in January.
\
Transportation Secretary Beverley K. Swaim-Staley countered that mass transit has helped keep the region's traffic congestion from being even more severe.
\
""I don't think anybody would want to be traveling the Capital Beltway without the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority,"" she said.

349,"SEE RELATED STORY (Maryland: The smaller family car takes kids to practice.)\ LONDON -- From the Monty Python School of Economics comes this true lesson of why gasoline in Britain yesterday -- when it could be found -- shot up, in some places, perilously close to $10 a gallon.\ Somehow, the very sound non-Pythonistic principles of supply and demand were involved. But they only partly explain the simultaneous creation of gasoline shortages where there reasonably should be none and prices that could almost make Americans silence their whining at the pumps.\ Here's what happened: Truckers who have been complaining forever about rising fuel prices, which oil companies have been blaming on rising demand, finally got sufficiently fed up that they threatened to blockade oil refineries and disrupt deliveries of Britain's abundant gasoline supplies. Their demand was that the government lower the substantial tax on gas.\ The government said no way, but it quickly sought to calm nerves all around, with unwanted results.\ Reassurance, anxiety\ The chancellor of the exchequer and the Ministry of Energy assured motorists that plenty of gas was on hand for all, which only caused more anxiety. When officials tried harder, assuring the public that the government had a plan to keep the gasoline flowing, they bumbled into the word rationing, which had the same predictable effect as a lighted match dropped into an oil well.\ Panic buying quickly ensued, which meant so much gas was pumped so quickly from the country's stations and into the country's cars that more than 3,000 of the 10,000 gas stations in Britain were forced to close yesterday, their tanks dry.\ ""We're a funny lot, aren't we?"" said Ray Holloway, a spokesman for Britain's Petrol Retailers Association, who said he watched with a mixture of bemusement and terror as the situation grew more serious. ""It's spot-on that there was so much yelling that the sky was falling that the sky indeed fell.\ ""Well, perhaps that's a bit much, but that's a helpful way of looking at it.""\ Helpful, indeed, but there seems little understanding here of why gas prices have risen so sharply so quickly, and there is genuine trepidation because winter never seems far off in Britain and heating bills are expected to rise for some people by about $600 over the course of the season.\ Gasoline in London has shot up from just under $5.50 a gallon a year ago to an average of about $7 a gallon, and yesterday's spike of nearly $10. Prices here and in the rest of Europe are perpetually higher than in the United States because hefty taxes are imposed here to discourage the reliance on foreign oil, to encourage public transportation, to ease road congestion and for the sake of the environment.\ Gasoline has historically been accepted throughout Europe as something of a luxury.\ With prices shooting up worldwide, British truckers toward the end of last week threatened to repeat a tactic that nearly shut down the country in 2000.\ Back then, brief blockades were remarkably effective, with truckers stopping the flow of gasoline from the country's 20 refineries, from Stanlow in northwest England, to Grangemouth in Scotland, to Cardiff in Wales.\ The protests were over Britain's gas tax, which remains the highest in Europe, then at about 80 percent of the cost of a gallon and now -- adjusted for the higher raw cost -- about 64 percent.\ The blockades succeeded in stopping about 90 percent of the normal flow of gasoline, costing Britain an estimated $350 million a day.\ When the first whispers of a blockade scheduled for yesterday emerged, Britons drove right to the pumps and filled their tanks to the brim.\ ""Every single person drove away with every drop they could,"" said Roy Kugan, the manager of a Shell station on Warwick Road in South Kensington, his convenience store empty because his pumps had no gas. ""Nobody was pumping Pounds 5.""\ The government tried to be helpful -- in the worst possible way.\ The chancellor, Gordon Brown, gave a speech Tuesday that served to draw attention to the run at the pumps, assuring motorists, ""The only thing that could cause disruption and instability is people responding to a shortage of supply that simply doesn't exist.""\ Newspapers and television, of course, printed and broadcast pictures of just that, while the government also sought to calm nerves by announcing plans were in place to ensure that police and emergency personnel would have means to get gas, which quickly became ""gas rationing,"" which quickly led to an even further run on supplies.\ And that, as will happen, led to already high prices of gasoline begin boosted even higher -- gouging, as it's known.\ No blockade after all\ And then, of course, the gates of the refineries that were to be blockaded yesterday were not. About the only people on hand at the refineries were reporters trying to pump excitement into their reports saying such things as, ""Britain dodged a bullet.""\ But not really.\ With nearly one-third of the country's gas stations closed, hourlong lines formed at stations whose tanks were not empty, and one protester told The Guardian newspaper that the threats would indeed become reality.\ The protester, who also appeared on television and will be known only by the Tony Blair mask he wears and the Captain Gatso name he insists on, said the government had better lessen the taxes or the protests that did not exist over the fuel shortage that did not exist would ""mushroom to something really big.""\ The refineries would indeed be blocked, he promised, as did the Road Haulage Association, and sooner or later car tanks would run as dry as the station tanks, with no deliveries allowed.\ Credit: SUN FOREIGN STAFF"

Maryland is not the only state heading into the fiscal doldrums.
\
While state budgets for fiscal 2006 represented the ""peak of state fiscal health this decade,"" year-end balances of general funds and ""rainy day"" funds are now on a negative slide, according to the National Conference of State Legislators' ""State Budget & Tax Actions 2007: Preliminary Report"" that was released this month.
\
With Maryland facing a $1.5 billion deficit next year, national spending trends are hitting states in the wallet, decreasing the amount of money they take in.
\
High gasoline prices, a plummeting housing market and a sluggish retail economy mean people are spending less, hurting tax revenue for states throughout the country, said Arturo Perez, a financial analyst with the conference.
\
Overall, states' finances are in a period of ""transition,"" the report said.
\
""There is a level of concern,"" Mr. Perez said. ""There is some level of caution taking place.""
\
From fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2008, the balance of states' general funds and rainy day funds are projected to fall from $58.1 billion to $41 billion - a drop of 29.4 percent, the report states.
\
In addition, the use of rainy day funds - money saved during healthy economic times for future expenses - will increase 28.3 percent, from $20.5 billion in fiscal 2006 to $26.3 billion in fiscal 2008.
\
Nationally, however, state spending isn't scheduled to slow down.
\
Although revenue is expected to increase 4.3 percent in fiscal 2007 and
\
2.6 percent in fiscal 2008, spending looks as if it will grow more - 8.8 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively.
\
The conference's specific budget projections for individual states will not be released until the final report is done sometime later this year, Mr. Perez said.
\
At the time of the report's writing, there were five states - California, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin - that had not yet completed their budgets.
\
When those governments are added it will probably only darken the fiscal picture, Mr. Perez said.
\
""If anything, it will give, maybe, a harsher assessment,"" he said.
\
Long-term trend?
\
During discussions at a recent state legislators' conference in Boston, lawmakers from throughout the country said they are being cautious and making sure one-time revenue boosts were being put toward one-time expenses, Mr. Perez said.
\
Historically, decreasing state revenue can be a sign of harsher economic news to come. For example, a decline in sales tax revenue was a precursor to the recession that hit states' economies in 2001, Mr. Perez said.
\
Smaller sales tax collections have already come onto state Comptroller Peter Franchot's radar.
\
Revenue estimates released in June showed an overall budget growth of 3.8 percent, but sales tax totals declined twice in three months. In May, the receipts fell 2.4 percent to $262.7 million.
\
Although high energy costs and the troubled housing market are presumed to be the cause, Mr. Franchot said in a letter earlier this summer that sales tax collections would be studied.
\
At this point it is difficult to tell how long the downward turn will continue, Mr. Perez said.
\
""Is this a minor interruption or a wholesale change? We don't know,"" he said.
\
Although state analysts have become more optimistic recently about Maryland's overall revenue picture, the next estimates will not be released until September, said Joseph Shapiro, a spokesman for the comptroller.
\
Since the General Assembly ended its session in April, Democrats and Republicans have sparred over how many cuts should be made and how many taxes can be raised.
\
Legislative leaders have offered plenty of suggestions and predictions - raising the sales tax, corporate tax, gas tax or income tax; ending the cap on in-state tuition; cutting 1,000 vacant state jobs; limiting budget growth at 1.5 percent; and auctioning off slots licenses for enough up-front cash to eliminate the deficit, among others.
\
Environmentalist groups have also pitched in some ideas on how to cut costs, including raising fees for air pollution to increase funding for the Maryland Department of the Environment.
\
House Speaker Michael E. Busch, D-Annapolis, has said local governments should help the state look for deficit solutions, and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, Jr., D-Calvert, said counties and municipalities will have to share some of the deficit burden in cuts to the aid that helps them pay for schools, pensions and health services.
\
Mr. O'Malley has pledged not to slough off the entire debt onto the shoulders of local governments, and that's a subject scheduled for this week's Maryland Association of Counties Summer Conference in Ocean City.
\
But so far, the governor has offered little detail about what he believes should be done to close the hole.
\
Although Mr. O'Malley cut $280 million of state spending in July, one of the few other policies he said he will pursue is an overhaul of the state's income tax brackets.
\
Under the current system, any Marylander who makes $3,000 or more in a year is placed in the highest tax bracket at 4.75 percent. Mr. O'Malley said he wants a more ""progressive"" system that would require richer residents to pay a larger percentage of their paychecks.
\
""Working with elected leaders in the General Assembly, we are also going to need to reform our tax system ,"" the governor said last week. ""This will mean closing loop holes for big giant corporations and - yes - demanding that the wealthiest among us pay a fair share.""

351," Three Carroll General Assembly legislators will play key roles in helping determine the outcome of crucial issues -- the current budget deficit, next year's budget and abortion rights -- in the 1991 session.\ Delegate Lawrence A. LaMotte, D-Carroll, Baltimore, said he will be a House leader in drafting and supporting an abortion-rights bill that will closely resemble the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\ The landmark ruling gave women a constitutional right to choose an abortion. Abortion-rights advocates fear the Supreme Court could overturn that decision, allowing states to enact restrictive legislation.\ Sen. Charles H. Smelser, D-Carroll, Frederick, Howard, and Delegate Richard N. Dixon, D-Carroll, serve on committees which will work toward balancing the fiscal 1991 budget and shaping what is expected to be a lean fiscal 1992 spending plan.\ Other high-priority issues include growth-control and tax-reform proposals, a possible gas tax increase and redistricting.\ Here's what Carroll's six-member delegation says about the anticipated top issues:\ Abortion: LaMotte said he is ""probably the most logical"" delegate to help lead the fight for passage of abortion-rights legislation, since he was ""working behind the scenes"" during last year's abortion battle fiasco. He said he expects to replace a sponsor of last year's abortion-rights bill who was elected to the Senate.\ Last year, a Senate compromise after eight grueling days of debate was killed by a House committee, leaving the issue unresolved.\ ""Voters want it resolved,"" said LaMotte. ""They made that clear in the election. Legislators want it out of their hair."" Any decision made this year likely would be placed on the 1992 ballot as a referendum question, he said.\ Sen. Larry E. Haines, R-Carroll, Baltimore, who opposes abortion, said the Senate might have enough anti-abortion legislators to block a bill as it did last year.\ 1990-1991 budget deficit: Smelser, a member of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee, said legislators will be occupied immediately with making further cuts to trim the state's estimated $423 million deficit.\ The state Board of Public Works, which has offered a plan to balance the budget, has authority to mandate some cuts, but many of the proposed measures must be approved by the legislature.\ ""When you talk about cutting . . . we have to be the bad guys,"" Smelser said.\ Maryland law requires the state to have a balanced budget.\ Fiscal 1992 budget: Because of the sluggish economy and downturn in revenues, Carroll legislators expect no increase from this year's $11.7 billion budget. That means new programs likely won't be introduced, some services could suffer and capital projects could be deferred, they say.\ ""In my years, I always saw the budget increase through natural growth,"" said Dixon, whose Appropriations Committee will work on the governor's submitted budget before sending it to the Senate. ""It's a different situation this year. It's going to require major adjustments in the budget.""\ LaMotte said he wants tough budget decisions to reflect a philosophical statement that cuts ""won't put people's lives and health at risk.""\ Haines agreed, adding that the state's education budget also should not be compromised.\ Delegate Donald B. Elliott, R-Carroll, Howard, said state government is too large and should be cut to save money. He advocates auditing every state department to detect wasteful spending.\ Growth controls: Carroll delegates vary in their opinions on recommendations proposed by the Governor's Commission on Growth in the Chesapeake Bay Region. The panel was charged with establishing guidelines to curtail sprawling development, channeling growth to population centers and protecting natural resources.\ Carroll planners and others throughout the state have objected to the recommendations, saying they infringe on local governments' powers to plan and regulate land use.\ LaMotte said he believes many officials at the local level have overreacted, noting that the state can delegate land-use authority to smaller jurisdictions and take it back.\ ""It's totally a power fight,"" he said. ""It has nothing to do with the environment or the recommendations. The fact is, environmental problems do not end at a county line. They must be dealt with at a minimum on a regional basis, and preferably, on a state basis.""\ Haines, Dixon and Elliott said the state should not interfere with local jurisdictions' land-use plans. Haines said that the proposals could have an adverse impact on property equity and unfairly restrict development rights.\ Most of the delegates agree that the recommendations probably won't be passed this year, partly because of more pressing economic problems. But Delegate Richard C. Matthews, R-Carroll, doesn't rule out the possibility.\ ""If the governor gets two or three large {political} subdivisions on his side, it might be a hard thing to stop,"" he said.\ Taxes: The report from the Maryland Commission on State Taxes and Tax Structure, also known as the Linowes Commission, has received mostly negative reviews from Carroll delegates.\ The commission has recommended restructuring the state's tax system to make taxation and distribution of receipts more equitable. The proposal includes recommendations for some new and expanded taxes, which would generate an estimated $800 million for the coming fiscal year alone.\ Several Carroll delegates said the legislature should not pass any tax increases this year because of the state's depressed economy.\ ""Taxes aren't a relevant issue in a year of a budget deficit,"" said Dixon. ""We need to cut government spending.""\ Haines agreed: ""An increase in taxes is not the answer,"" he said."
352," Revival efforts bring new life to old Pigtown\ Three cheers for The Sun's recent article and editorial highlighting the potential of the Washington Boulevard-Pigtown neighborhood, (""Struggling Pigtown awaits boost from Montgomery Park,"" Jan. 12, and ""A chance for renewal,"" editorial, Jan. 8).\ This neighborhood, indeed, is primed for regeneration. And although The Sun was right to focus on Montgomery Park and the large- scale redevelopment efforts of the Baltimore Development Corp. in the Carroll Camden Industrial Park, a number of smaller, but no less important, efforts are under way to revitalize this historic community.\ By marketing the area, acting as a liaison with the city and securing grants to benefit the neighborhood, the Washington Boulevard Main Street program has generated more than $5 million in public and private investment.\ Along Washington Boulevard, six businesses have opened, 15 others have undertaken storefront improvement projects funded by the Washington Boulevard Main Street project and 85 full-time jobs have been created.\ In the coming months, Pigtown will celebrate the opening of a long-awaited coffeehouse and begin planning the 2nd annual Pigtown Festival.\ There are big things happening in Pigtown, but the smaller efforts count too.\ Jack Dann\ Baltimore\ The writer is program manager for the Washington Boulevard Main Street program.\ A recent Sun article was titled ""Struggling Pigtown awaits boost from Montgomery Park"" (Jan. 12). But Pigtown is hardly ""struggling."" As a matter of fact, there are many positive developments that are now under way.\ Montgomery Park has been and will continue to be an anchor for the west side of the neighborhood and will draw many businesses and residents to the area. Camden Crossing, an 8-acre housing development featuring homes five blocks from downtown whose prices start at $150,000, will also bring people to the neighborhood.\ Washington Boulevard's Main Street program has brought new business owners to the area. And the University of Maryland is building a new heath care facility.\ Cultural amenities such as the B&O Railroad Museum (celebrating its 175th anniversary with many special events), Mount Clare Museum House and the successful annual Pigtown Festival held in September have also helped bring new residents and business owners to the area.\ Maybe the next article should have the heading ""Pigtown is in Hog Heaven.""\ Rodney Carroll\ Narda Carroll\ Baltimore\ State is already taxed too much\ I can't believe Democrats in the Maryland General Assembly are proposing an increase in the sales tax, gas tax and liquor tax (""Md. Democrats to introduce tax increases,"" Jan. 23). Is it not bad enough that Maryland residents are already heavily taxed on everything?\ With the economy slumping, people losing jobs and more baby boomers retiring, the General Assembly is trying to put the squeeze on the taxpayer to dig the state out of debt.\ But if these tax increases are approved, more people will be traveling to nearby states to shop and live.\ The Assembly should go along with Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.'s budget proposal and his slots initiative.\ The slots initiative will not only bring money into the state's coffers but will provide jobs and help the sagging economy in Maryland.\ George Pruchniewski\ Baltimore\ Fight against slots creates curious allies\ The Maryland Restaurant Association should be very careful who it goes to bed with in the battle to keep slots out of Maryland (""Groups unite to oppose slots,"" Jan. 16).\ Some of these same ""friends"" will be coming back later with pushes for higher liquor taxes and smoking bans in all public buildings.\ In politics, a friend is rarely a friend for very long.\ C. D. Wilmer\ Baltimore\ What about voices backing Bush?\ The Sun has done it again - showing itself to be a newspaper that reports not the facts but the biased opinion of its writers.\ The subheading on the Jan. 24 article ""Putting `why' before `war,'"" for instance, said: ""Views: A sampling of voices from newspapers across the United States indicates disagreement with the Bush administration's stand on Iraq.""\ The article proceeded to list quotes from publications from across the nation, none of which included support for the Bush administration's stance. How can that be a reasonable ""sampling"" of voices?\ I guess it would have taken too much effort to show a balanced view of the news.\ Scott Lancaster\ Dayton\ Toppling Hussein won't stem anger\ Thomas Friedman's column ""Why Hussein must go"" (Opinion\ Commentary, Jan. 23) was pure sophistry.\ Mr. Friedman suggests that a regime change in Iraq will somehow solve the problem of Middle Eastern youths who threaten Western societies. Give me a break. Most of the young men behind the Sept. 11 attacks were from Saudi Arabia. So why don't we get rid of the oppressive leaders of Saudi Arabia?\ And while we're at it, why not go after the leadership of Israel, Syria, Egypt and all the other oppressive Middle Eastern states?\ Would that solve the problems of the Arab youths? I doubt it.\ Herbert B. Shankroff\ Towson\ Inspectors needed closer to home\ After reading ""Toxic legacy of military haunts bases"" (Jan. 19), which graphically reminds us of our own weapons of mass destruction and deadly chemical wastes, I must conclude that we need U.N. weapons inspectors in the United States more than in Iraq.\ We are a far greater threat to world peace than the countries we decry as ""terrorists.""\ Bonnie Dahbura\ Baltimore\ Health costs hurt rest of economy\ State Insurance Commissioner Steven B. Larsen's article ""Medical care costs need cure"" (Jan. 19) was a very thoughtful and comprehensive analysis of the crisis in health insurance premiums. But he left out one major result of these skyrocketing costs: the implications for the state economy of this massive shift of wealth to the health care sector.\ But more money spent on health care means less spent in other areas of the economy. And for merchants, skyrocketing health costs often mean no raises for their employees or no hiring, or the deferral of business investments.\ Encouraging a more vigorous competitive environment for health insurers should be part of the agenda for the commission on health care that Mr. Larsen proposes. With no competition, cost control is a losing battle.\ Tom S. Saquella\ Annapolis\ The writer is president of the Maryland Retailers Association."
353,"Next month's opening of the main section of the Intercounty Connector linking Interstate 95 with Interstate 270 in Montgomery County is expected to have significant effects on Baltimore's economy as it brings the state's richest job and commercial market a half-hour closer to its largest city.\The debut of the new section Nov. 22 will close the gap between the already opened western section of the ICC and I-95 in Prince George's County. Unlike the first section, which has been mostly used for local traffic, the opening of the new stretch is expected to bring immediate benefits to many Baltimore-area drivers for whom the trip to Rockville or Gaithersburg has long been a traffic nightmare.\Anirban Basu, chief executive of the Sage Policy Group in Baltimore, said the impact of the $2.6 billion ICC could be ""profound"" on this region.\""It will allow Baltimoreans to access commercial opportunities in the Washington area in ways that have not previously been accessible,"" he said.\One of the key areas of opportunity, he said, will be for Baltimoreans seeking employment in the high-wage, technology-savvy I-270 corridor.\""Right now, it's not practical to seek employment if one lives in Catonsville and wants a job in Bethesda or Rockville because of the traffic,"" he said. ""Now the accessibility of jobs in the Washington area is significantly enhanced by the ICC.""\With the aid of favorable weather this year, construction of the main section is coming in on time, if not a bit early. A section extending the eastern end to U.S. 1 has been deferred, but the portion opening next month is the important one for an improved connection between Baltimore and Montgomery County.\The state estimates the trip from Laurel to Gaithersburg on local roads to be about 47 minutes. Using the ICC, it's expected to take only about 17 minutes. Baltimore-to-Gaithersburg travelers will experience that time savings.\But with greater access will also come higher costs - and drivers across the state will begin feeling those next week. One of the main reasons the Maryland Transportation Authority is imposing significant toll increases starting Tuesday -- which will, among other things, bump the cost of using the three Baltimore Harbor crossings from $2 to $3 each way -- is that the bills for building the ICC are coming due.\Approval of the ICC came during the 2003-2007 administration of Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. after almost a half-century of wrangling over the economic and social impacts of building the 18-mile road. One key decision that cleared the way for approval was to make the highway a toll road, which let state officials avoid having to raise money for construction by seeking a gas tax increase. When he took office in 2007, Gov. Martin O'Malley essentially left the ICC decision and financing plans in place.\Dru Schmidt-Perkins, executive director of 1,000 Friends of Maryland, noted that she and other environmentalists warned that building the ICC would eventually result in higher tolls.\""There's scant joy in saying 'I told you so,' "" Schmidt-Perkins said. ""We need to learn from this and declare it the last highway, move on and go toward better planning.""\Those who start using the ICC on Nov. 22 will enjoy almost a two-week respite from paying tolls. Transportation Secretary Beverley K. Swaim-Staley announced Friday that the entire length of the ICC - now formally known as Route 200 - will be toll-free from Nov. 22 through Dec. 4.\On Dec. 5, users of the ICC will pay tolls at the same rates as previously charged on the section between Interstate 370, a short feeder leading to I-270, and Georgia Avenue. Those tolls come to 25 cents a mile at peak times - 6 a.m.-9 a.m. and 4 p.m.-7 p.m. weekdays. The rate is 20 cents off-peak and 10 cents overnight. Those rates come to a total of $1.60 to $4, depending on time of day, for those who travel the full length of the highway open in December.\Tolls are charged in both directions, and there is no commuter rate, as there is for older state toll facilities.\Harold Bartlett, executive secretary of the transportation authority, said he can't say for sure how long the tolls will remain at that level.\""We'll review the traffic volume every three months,"" he said. Bartlett said the authority is projecting that after the new section opens, about 25,000 vehicles will use the toll road each day, a number he said could rise to 35,000 in six to 12 months.\The tolls are now set at the low end of a range set by the authority's board before the first section opened in February. It allows the executive secretary to raise tolls on 10 days' notice - to as much as 35 cents a mile in the case of peak-hour tolls. Any increases beyond the existing range would require public hearings and a board vote.\Whatever the amount, motorists will have the consolation of never having to slow for a tollbooth on the all-electronic highway. Tolls will be collected either by E-ZPass detectors or by cameras that will record the license plates of cars without E-ZPass and send a bill in the mail. Drivers of cars billed by mail will face a 50 percent surcharge to cover the extra costs.\In theory, users of the ICC will never face traffic-related backups because tolls will be increased to levels that will keep demand from exceeding the capacity of the road. Bartlett said it will be a matter of years, not months, before the authority has to face that issue.\Bartlett said paving has been completed. Tasks that remain include hanging signs, installing guardrails, putting the final touches on the all-electronic toll collection system and painting lane stripes.\""The highway's beautiful,"" Bartlett said. ""It appears as if it's a highway through a park.""\For opponents, that was one of the main objections to the ICC. It does in fact cut through several parks and sensitive stream valleys, though the state has spent hundreds of millions on projects to mitigate the environmental damage.\""I can't think of any other project that's paid this much attention to the environment,"" Bartlett said.\Schmidt-Perkins contends that the highway is still a blow to the Chesapeake Bay.\""There's no way to pave 18 miles of asphalt without causing problems, and where we try to mitigate that, it's just reducing the harm,"" she said.\michael.dresser@baltsun.com\Credit: The Baltimore Sun"
354,"State needs revenue to meet public needs\Congratulations to Gov. Martin O'Malley for having the courage to put a comprehensive revenue package on the table to balance the state budget (""O'Malley mounts budget session blitz,"" Oct. 3).\From the perspective of the community-based agencies that serve the 92,000 children and adults who use Maryland's public mental health system, cutting our way out of the state's $1.7 billion deficit is simply not an option.\Despite strong funding support from former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. and from Mr. O'Malley so far, public mental health services remain badly underfunded.\Increasing numbers of uninsured people with severe mental illnesses are being turned away from intensive rehabilitation programs, and thousands of others who should be in treatment are instead in jails or prisons or are homeless.\Work force shortages in our clinical, vocational and housing programs are at crisis levels.\And Maryland is not spending beyond its means.\According to the U.S. Census Bureau, our overall state and local spending per capita is well below the national average: Maryland ranks 31st among the 50 states and the District of Columbia overall, and last as a percentage of income.\Of course, there are lies, damn lies and statistics. So to The Sun's army of anti-tax letter writers, I say this: God forbid that you're poisoned by tainted food, or on a bridge when it collapses, or in a burning house without a community fire department.\God forbid your loved ones develop an illness or disability that only Medicaid will cover or that carries needs that only a publicly funded program will meet.\The only responsible way to balance the state budget is with new revenues.\Herbert S. Cromwell\Catonsville\The writer is executive director of the Community Behavioral Health Association of Maryland.\Cut state spending to boost efficiency\Gov. Martin O'Malley's solution to the structural deficit is twofold: Use slots to raise revenue and raise taxes to raise revenue (""O'Malley mounts budget session blitz,"" Oct. 3).\The governor plans to make the tax code more fair by raising the state income tax on higher-income earners.\However, Mr. O'Malley's plan will hurt the same lower-income earners he is trying to help by raising the sales tax, cigarette tax, gas tax and corporate income tax and using slots to increase government revenue. Sales, gas and cigarette taxes are all regressive taxes, and the costs of corporate income taxes are passed on to the poor through higher prices.\Slot machines harm low-income earners most because they have less disposable income to lose in slot machines.\The GOP's suggestion that the state limit increases in state spending to 3.5 percent is sound policy (""GOP slams budget plan,"" Oct. 2).\And here's even more sound policy: Cut state spending.\Government spending never provides the most efficient solutions to problems.\Why reward inefficiency with increasing funding?\Ryan McQuighan\Baltimore\It's long past time to pass slots plan\I think I speak for most everyone I know in Maryland when I ask: When will the state's politicians grow up?\I understand that legalizing slots is a big decision that has been debated for years. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. championed it when he was governor but could not get the version of a slots plan he wanted approved by the Democrats.\Now Gov. Martin O'Malley is proposing a slots plan. But the Republicans don't like the way he has presented it and the idea of approving it in a special session (""GOP shuns slots proposal,"" Oct. 4).\Republicans and Democrats need to understand that most Marylanders want slots.\We don't care how it gets done - just get it done.\Dean Scannell\Perry Hall\Myanmar is a better place to intervene\If President Bush and his administration are keen on attacking yet another country (""Iran accuses U.S. of `psychological war,'"" Oct. 4), I have a suggestion: Intervene in Burma (now called Myanmar) (""Myanmar troops round up citizens,"" Oct. 4).\Unlike the people in Iraq and, I suspect, Iran, I think the Burmese really would welcome us with flowers.\Joe Surkiewicz\Baltimore\Change vote to aid kids who need care\Recognizing that there are 8 million children without health insurance coverage in our country, the House and Senate passed a strong, bipartisan bill to reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program.

But more votes will be needed in the House to override the veto.\Every member of Maryland's congressional delegation voted for the SCHIP bill except Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett.\A change of his vote could be a matter of life or death for the children whose coverage depends on the passage of SCHIP.\Linda Black\Woodbine\Health care veto is hardly pro-life\President Bush's veto of the State Children's Health Insurance Program bill should make it apparent that neither he nor the Republicans who voted against the bill are as ""pro-life"" as they claim (""Veto of SCHIP sets up battle of ideologies,"" Oct. 4).\In fact, vetoing or voting against a bill to ensure health insurance coverage for children is very much ""anti-life.""\People like Mr. Bush should be recognized for what they are - ""pro-birth"" rather than ""pro-life.""\After their self-righteous speeches against abortion are over, they suddenly lose respect for the sanctity of life.\These ""pro-birthers"" often ignore the needs of children and the poor.

355,"President Barack Obama turned to Maryland for another high-level appointment Friday as the White House announced that he intends to name Maryland Transportation Secretary John D. Porcari to the No. 2 position in the U.S. Department of Transportation.\In choosing Porcari, Obama has selected one of the few state transportation secretaries whose portfolio includes all the major modes of travel - highways, aviation, mass transit, maritime commerce and rail freight. If he clears the required background checks and is confirmed by the Senate, Porcari would serve as deputy to Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, a former Illinois congressman and a Republican.\Porcari, 50, would become the second member of Gov. Martin O'Malley's Cabinet to be chosen for a key position in the Obama administration. The president earlier nominated Thomas E. Perez, Maryland's secretary of labor, licensing and regulation, to head the Justice Department's civil rights division. Obama also selected Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein as principal deputy commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.\Porcari would bring with him a thorough knowledge of the transportation issues that affect Maryland and the region, and a reputation for addressing environmental concerns associated with large-scale projects.\""Just like Obama and LaHood are not going to ignore the needs of Illinois, John wouldn't ignore the needs of Maryland, the greater Washington D.C. area and the East,"" said John Horsley, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.\""He will be aware of what is needed here,"" Horsley said, adding that Porcari would assuredly serve as an honest broker in the competition for scarce resources.\Porcari also has grappled with funding shortfalls - a pressing issue at both the federal and state levels.\In recent months he has had to make a stream of unpleasant choices as the state's transportation revenues have dried up as a result of the national economic downturn. More recently, he has received national attention for his efforts to put federal stimulus money to use quickly by emphasizing small, ready-to-go maintenance projects.\Horsley described Porcari as ""very thoughtful but tough"" and said the Marylander would fill the role of chief operating officer of the department, which has a $70 billion budget and 60,000 employees.\O'Malley released a statement congratulating Porcari on his nomination.\""John has served the people of Maryland as secretary of transportation during an unprecedented time of growth and reinvestment in our state's infrastructure, including the beginning stages of the Inter-County Connector, the Woodrow Wilson Bridge Project, and over $1 billion in recovery and reinvestment projects throughout Maryland,"" the statement said. ""John's leadership as an advocate for infrastructure investment impacts the lives of all Marylanders as they travel on resurfaced highways, restored bridges, or new hybrid buses.""\Porcari, who served a term as transportation secretary under Gov. Parris N. Glendening from 1999 to 2002 before returning to the post under O'Malley, has been known as a cool, affable administrator with a knack for working with legislators of both parties.\Democratic House Speaker Michael E. Busch said Friday that Porcari ""has been one of the best secretaries of any agency since I've been in public office.""\""It's a huge loss to the state of Maryland, but it reflects the kind of quality people that the Obama administration is attracting to the federal agencies,"" said Busch, an Anne Arundel Democrat first elected in 1987.\Del. Norman H. Conway, a Wicomico County Democrat who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said he's sorry to see Porcari leave state service.\""You can pretty well rely on whatever he tells you. He has been a tremendous leader for the department and for the state,"" Conway said.\Porcari said Friday that the nomination has been in the works for several weeks. He said he expects none of the tax problems that have complicated the confirmation of some other Obama nominees.\""It sure pays to lead a straightforward, boring life,"" he said.\Porcari said he has met with LaHood and looks forward to assisting him with ""a very full and ambitious agenda."" He would be coming aboard at a time when the Obama administration faces the task of winning passage of legislation funding the nation's transportation program for the next six years. The current authorization bill expires this year amid concerns that the federal gas tax is no longer raising enough revenue to keep the highway trust from the brink of insolvency.\As Maryland secretary, Porcari has been insistent that transportation planning is inextricably intertwined with environmental concerns. Despite disagreements over the ICC, the long-debated toll road now under construction in suburban Washington, he has maintained strong ties with advocates of smart growth and the Chesapeake Bay. Horsley noted that Porcari chairs the state transportation officials' association's task force on climate change.\Dru Schmidt-Perkins, executive director of 1000 Friends of Maryland, called the nomination of Porcari a ""terrific pick"" for the Obama administration.\""Secretary Porcari understands the breadth of transportation issues for its impact on the environment to getting people to jobs,"" she said. ""What is Maryland's loss is really the country's gain.""\Shaun Adamec, a spokesman for O'Malley, said no decision had yet been made about a successor to Porcari. He said the governor considers it a ""compliment"" that Obama would again turn to the O'Malley Cabinet to recruit a high-level official.\Porcari lives in Cheverly with his wife, Heidi, and five children. He said he might end up commuting on Washington's Metro.\""I live on the Orange Line, so that works out pretty well,"" he said.\Baltimore Sun reporters Gadi Dechter and Julie Bykowicz contributed to this article.\profile john d. porcari\Age: 50\Hometown: Cheverly\Family: Married, five children\Education: B.A., University of Dayton; master's in public administration, Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy, State University of New York at Albany\Career: Maryland secretary of transportation (2007-present; 1999-2003); vice president for administrative affairs, University of Maryland, College Park (2003-2007); former Prince George's County development manager\Credit: michael.dresser@baltsun.com and paul.west@baltsun.com"
356,"Wait 'til next year.\That's the theme of this year's General Assembly session when it comes to contentious possible solutions to the fiscal mess Maryland - like all other states - finds itself in.\The theme bothers Republicans. They worry that higher taxes might be pushed through Annapolis next year by a Democratic majority fretful about making such moves before November's elections.\""They are trying to use smoke and mirrors and Band-Aids to get through this year,"" said Senate Minority Leader Allan H. Kittleman, a Howard County Republican. ""Next year,"" he predicted, ""they will have to have the highest tax increase in the history of Maryland.""\Democrats say that's not true, but few expect the $13 billion plan Gov. Martin O'Malley is set to unveil Wednesday will tackle the state's structural deficit. Many believe the spending proposal will include unpalatable cuts to close a $2 billion gap between expected revenue and spending on programs - but also short-term fixes and placeholders in expectation of a new round of federal stimulus funds.\O'Malley's chief of staff said the governor's spending plan for the coming year, which by law must produce a balanced budget, will have no new taxes in it. Still, O'Malley acknowledged last week that ""nobody will like"" the proposal he's working on.\It wasn't supposed to be like this in an election year.\O'Malley came into office three years ago promising a permanent solution to Maryland's financial troubles. He and his allies in the heavily Democratic legislature took a risk in 2007, summoning lawmakers to Annapolis for a special session that was supposed to produce a permanent solution. They passed a sales tax increase, some tax cuts and a gambling plan.\They were banking on voter anger over a tax hike subsiding by now, and thought they'd be rewarded by a smooth budget process and robust funding for education, the environment and other programs.\Then came the worst economic downturn in a half-century. After 21 straight months of hardship, Marylanders have lost their jobs or endured lower pay, and state income tax revenue has plunged.\""In recent years, we've had to confront extraordinary problems,"" said O'Malley chief of staff Matthew D. Gallagher.\Those problems show few signs of ending. If the economy doesn't improve - or if budget cuts are somehow less appealing than a tax increase - here are a few changes that some lawmakers say could get fresh attention after the election:\* Sin taxes: Annapolis hasn't boosted the state's excise tax on liquor in more than half a century, and the tax on beer and wine was last changed in 1972.\Right now, those two taxes provide the state with about $29 million in general fund revenue, but Sen. Richard S. Madaleno, a Montgomery County Democrat, says his proposal to raise it to a dime-a-drink would bring in $200 million and encourage better behavior.\""There is a growing awareness of the costs of alcohol to our society,"" Madaleno said.\O'Malley opposes the idea, as do the leaders of both houses in the General Assembly.\But Henry Bogdan, managing director of the Maryland Association of Nonprofit Organizations, says lawmakers might change their minds once they understand the depth of proposed program cuts.\Industry lobbyists reminded lawmakers last week that the proposed tax would represent a 500 percent increase. They warned that Marylanders would flock across state lines to buy beer, wine and liquor. Also, they say, such a plan would hurt already-struggling small taverns and restaurants.\Another oft-discussed idea would expand sales taxes on fatty foods and create a so-called ""snack tax."" The General Assembly enacted such a plan during a fiscal crisis in the early 1990s but repealed it within four years. Since then, it has been proposed occasionally.\* Fuel taxes: Increasing the tax rate that Marylanders pay on gas could free up money for health, public safety and education, said Neil Bergsman, the director of the Maryland Budget and Tax Policy Institute, a left-leaning organization.\When the General Assembly raised the sales taxes in 2007, it left gas taxes alone and dedicated a chunk of sales-tax revenue to transportation. Bergsman says upping the gas tax by 10 cents a gallon would let lawmakers move $220 million into the general fund. Plus there would be an additional $100 million for transportation.\A bill to do that was introduced last year, but there's been little support.\Warren G. Deschenaux, the legislature's chief fiscal analyst, says ultimately there will be. ""I don't know what other revenue there is to pay for transportation,"" he said.\* Extending sales taxes to services: Tax analysts complain that Maryland's revenue structure has not fully caught up with economic changes that are decades old. Services aren't taxed.\""It is the dream of tax reformers that it would be better to tax services as well so there would not be favoritism toward the consumption of services over the consumption of goods,"" said Roy T. Meyers, a budget expert and professor at University of Maryland Baltimore County.\The General Assembly waded into this debate in 2007 - and it did not go well, he said. The governor proposed taxing a variety of services, including real-estate management, tanning salons, massage therapy and health club memberships. But each group protested - sometimes with elaborate and eye-catching gimmicks, including calisthenics outside the state capitol. Lawmakers said no to all but the computer services industry, and levied an unpopular tax that was repealed months after it was enacted.\""It was not a very serious discussion in 2007,"" Meyers said, ""which I think was a significant mistake. It is really unfair only to cherry-pick on services.""\The sales tax is the second-largest revenue source for the state, after income taxes, and generates $3.6 billion of the state's general fund revenue. Broadening it could net hundreds of millions more, depending on how it is done.\* Teacher pensions: Maryland presently shoulders the cost for teacher pensions in each county but doesn't set the salaries which form the basis of pension costs.\Gallagher, O'Malley's chief of staff, says next year's budget will fully fund teacher pensions and the counties won't be asked to chip in.\But among lawmakers, the question is when, not if, counties will have to pitch in. The change will put a further strain on local governments, which might have to raise their own taxes or fees to cover the cost.\The state will have to put more than $900 million toward teacher pensions this year, according to projections from the Department of Legislative Services.\""We would like to pay for the pensions this time,"" said Del. Sheila Hixson, a Montgomery County Democrat who chairs the Ways and Means Committee. ""It may have to be looked at in the future.""\And, on that issue, there might be some bipartisan consensus. Sen. David Brinkley, a Western Maryland Republican, said local governments ""should have to kick in some money"" to teacher retirement plans.\Credit: annie.linskey@baltsun.com"

359,"Sworn in earlier this month, James T. Smith Jr. is Maryland's 13th transportation secretary. At an age when many people have begun or are contemplating retirement, Smith, 71, is taking the helm of a 10,000-employee agency that oversees highways, bridges, tunnels, BWI Marshall Airport, the port of Baltimore, the Motor Vehicle Administration and mass transit. He said he took the job because of an infusion of $4.4 billion tied to passage this year of a comprehensive transportation revenue bill and because he has long known and admired many of the professionals who now work for him.\It seems like Baltimore's Red Line light rail project is on the cusp of becoming shovel-ready. What's the timeline? \We have $170 million from the Transportation Infrastructure Investment Act programmed for final design and right-of-way acquisition. We're proceeding with that. With the feds, we're going to ask them for full funding in the upcoming year and we're moving ahead to make the project a reality. You ask for all and you hope to get as close to all as you can. We have some pretty heavy hitters as supporters, so I'm optimistic. Whether we get it next year or whether we get it the following year, that's not as important. We asked for it this year because we wanted to get it on everybody's radar. I met with Senator [Barbara A.] Mikulski just this week and I'm going to get her more information because I want her to be fully on top of this. Senator [Ben] Cardin is also being very supportive. In fact, our congressional delegation has been very effective, and I'm going to use that strength as much as I can. \Because of the enormous backlog of projects that built up during the lean years, how long is the Baltimore area's wish list, and how much money are we talking about? \I haven't added it all up, but there are a lot of projects in the queue and a lot of projects on planning tables and in planning rooms that have had no momentum whatsoever. My biggest challenge is getting some excellent projects in the queue out into the field and doing it as fast as is reasonably possible. ... There's a need. We have congestion on highways. We have mass transit needs. We have port needs to get that new terminal and expand into the Sparrows Point peninsula. We have the need both from a quality-of-life standpoint and from an economic development and jobs standpoint. There haven't been any new construction projects to speak of in the last four or five years because there has been no money. A lot of the BRAC interests at Aberdeen and the MARC train interests in Baltimore City and Baltimore County and beyond, we haven't been able to respond to that. \I'd like to circle back on Sparrows Point. That's a heavy lift. It has implications for the surrounding communities, the business future of not only Baltimore County but the state's maritime industry, and the environment. How close is the state to making something happen? What is the time frame? \Now is the time frame. We're attempting to stimulate negotiations right now. This is the time to look at the need to expand the port. I mean, the port is going gangbusters. It is an economic engine for the state. If we don't move now we're going to be landlocked. We're going to lose the opportunity to move into the Sparrows Point peninsula, and we can't afford to do that. We need the additional terminal. We'll be able to take advantage of creating jobs -- both direct and indirect. \Once again, the state is looking at the need for a third Chesapeake Bay crossing. The Bay Bridge, if and when capacity is expanded, could be the biggest political football of all time, given the scope of the project, the cost and the communities on both the Eastern and Western shores that will be affected. Is this just another study to be put on a shelf next to other studies or is this the first step to something tangible? \We have a study that's supposed to be completed in two years that will determine whether we need a third crossing and what kind of a bridge we need. We're taking steps to preserve what we've got. We're looking at repair and/or repaving of the westbound span of the Bay Bridge and we're in the process of rewrapping the suspension cables because of corrosion that occurred. We've got to get these studies done in order to know when we have to move and what kind of a structure we're going to have to have in order to satisfy the growing demands. Sure, it can be done. Anything can be done. The question is, should it be done, and when should it be done, and what should it look like? You have to get through all of those before you start planning where you're going to put it and what impacts you're going to get beyond traffic relief it's going to provide. I think we're taking the steps in the right order. In a couple of years, we're going to have the answers. \What have transportation officials learned about the impact of Base Realignment and Closure -- BRAC -- and how is that knowledge being applied to mitigate problems? \I don't think we necessarily learned anything new. I was involved in this as Baltimore County executive in pushing for BRAC improvements, particularly at Aberdeen. I think our expectations have been met, only we had no money to prepare for those expectations. As a result, we've got a lot of catch-up to do. We're going to be evaluating how much of that catch-up we can work into our six-year planning time. Aberdeen, Fort Meade, Bethesda -- they're all going to get attention for intersection improvements, for some road widening. Folks who are impacted should be pleased that there was enough courage in the General Assembly to apply the resources to make improvements. They're going to see the results of the money they're paying for the gas tax and they're going to be pleased because it's going to make a difference in their drive time and it's going to make a difference in the quality of their lives. This money is not going into a black hole. This money is going into the streets, in the tracks, in the air and on the water. \The final question -- and I know it makes six, not five. Why did the Washington suburbs get to call their light rail project the Purple Line, when that name would have been more at home in Baltimore, the home of the Super Bowl champion Ravens? \It should have [laughing]. But I wasn't here then. \candy.thomson@baltsun.com \James T.

360,"
Last spring, the night before the final legislative session of his two terms ended, Gov. Martin O'Malley couldn't sleep.
\
Instead of continuing to fret about whether the legislature would pass his bill to raise the minimum wage, O'Malley wrote a 1,684-word letter to his staff about the victories and struggles of his years in office, outlining the six qualities he believed made a ""good leader.""
\
Among them, he wrote, ""Good leaders make themselves vulnerable - it is the only way they get difficult things done.""
\
O'Malley leaves public office Wednesday for the first time in more than 23 years, leaving behind a substantial record of accomplishments at the city and state levels. His tenure also makes him vulnerable to criticism that he moved the state to the left and raised more taxes than the electorate could tolerate.
\
Both Democrats and Republicans consider O'Malley extremely effective at pushing his policies through the legislature. Yet they describe the Democrat's legacy in sharply partisan terms. O'Malley has either been a charismatic, nationalleader who pulled Maryland through an economic recession or a tax-and-spend liberal who went too far.
\
""History will judge him as a governor who accomplished quite a bit, whether you like him or don't like him,"" said House Speaker Michael E. Busch, a fellow Democrat.
\
O'Malley ushered through landmark social policy bills legalizing same-sex marriage, granting discounted university tuition to some immigrants in the country illegally, repealing the death penalty and enacting strict new gun control laws.
\
Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller said O'Malley has been the most effective Maryland governor since the mid-1970s, but his success in pulling Maryland to the left came with a price - one that was reflected in the November election, when Republican Gov.-elect Larry Hogan defeated O'Malley's preferred successor.
\
""Because of his politics, a majority of the subdivisions of the state felt neglected,"" Miller, a Democrat, said.
\
O'Malley closed the troubled 19th-centery House of Corrections in Jessup in his first term, but a gang scandal erupted at the state-run Baltimore City Detention Center during his second. While the state's online health insurance marketplace enrolled record numbers of people in private plans and Medicaid this year, last year it had one of the worst rollouts in the nation.
\
He increaseed sales taxes, income taxes on high-income earners and created new taxes on services. He also raised the gas tax for the first time in more than two decades and increased the corporate tax rate.
\
""O'Malley's legacy is the strongest Republican Party since the 1920s,"" said Joe Cluster, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party. ""He was a strong campaigner, he won two elections, but in the end, his policies created an environment that will bring this state closer to being a two-party state.""
\
Even some Democrats agree that the Republican wave that took the governor's mansion and a record number of House of Delegate seats was sparked, in part, by O'Malley's push to raise taxes.
\
""We were, in retrospect, a bit too aggressive in that department,"" said House Economic Matters Chairman Dereck Davis, a Prince George's County Democrat.
\
""The party led by the governor, point blank, was too aggressive in trying to maintain the status quo,"" Davis said. ""You have to make tough choices, even if they're just temporary, you have to make those [budget] cuts. You have to slow things down. We were unwilling to say no to anybody, about anything.""
\
O'Malley and his defenders argue the tax increases were necessary to keep investing in schools and to stave off painful cuts during the nationwide recession. O'Malley inherited a $1.7 billion structural deficit when he took over from Republican Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich in 2007. This year, that deficit stands at an estimated $750 million - a reduction of nearly a billion dollars.
\
""He governed during very difficult times, and he didn't want to use that as an excuse not to make progress,"" said O'Malley's former chief of staff, Matt Gallagher. ""We wouldn't. ... He blazed new trails, he found creative ways to get things done, and all going into a pretty hard economic headwind.""
\
O'Malley also cut the state workforce by 6,000. By his count, the state government is now smaller per capita than it has been since 1973. And while O'Malley did increase the annual rate of state spending each year, he did it by smaller percentages than any of the four previous governors.
\
The governor acknowledged that he has developed a reputation for raising taxes. On his blog, he relayed an anecdote about setting up a heating oil account for his new home in Baltimore. He wrote that when the operator asked for his last name:
\
""O'Malley,"" I answered. ""Like the out-going governor.""
\
""Ah, yes,"" she said. ""The 'tax man'...""
\
O'Malley said he has struggled to convey to Marylanders what he has been doing as governor - a task that was easier when he was Baltimore's mayor.
\
""I've had many people, even years later, thank me for helping them or a family member get into a drug treatment program during the city's turnaround; I've never had one of the 700,000 citizens who, for the first time now, have health care ever acknowledge the state's role in making this possible.""
\
Plenty of others have taken notice of O'Malley's work. He used a data-driven method to manage government, earning him accolades from national magazines as wonky as ""Governing"" and as hip as ""Esquire.""
\
Among the data-based accomplishments he cites: Violent crime has been reduced by 27.3 percent; infant mortality has declined by 17.5 percent overall, and by 25 percent among African-Americans. But his published goals show he has also fallen short in a few areas. The recent heroin epidemic, for instance, reversed any progress O'Malley's administration had made toward reducing overdose deaths by 20 percent; instead, they're up 7.4 percent.
\
Asked about his legacy, O'Malley said he's uncomfortable with the word. Instead, he said he hopes that this ""new way of governing that we brought forward will continue.""
\
""Agree or disagree with the policy goals, we have been very effective at governing and delivering results, and achieving progress, and solving problems, and doing it in a very open, transparent and collaborative sort of way - in advance of every other state in America,"" O'Malley said.
\
He applied that strategy to cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay, relying on data, science and deadlines.
\
O'Malley championed environmental protection aggressively - joining Parris N. Glendening and Harry Hughes atop the list of Maryland's ""greenest"" governors. Despite tight fiscal times, he pushed through funding and fee increases intended to help clean up the bay, and tightened regulations on farming and on sprawling development. He also committed the state to reducing climate-altering greenhouse gases and created subsidies for putting wind turbines off Ocean City.
\
His environmental push, some say, deepened Maryland's rural-urban divide. And Republicans say it was among the many issues that O'Malley used to bolster his credentials for a potential run for president.
\
""If you look at the boxes that need to be checked for a presidential primary run, it sure looks like every box got checked,"" said former state Sen. E.J. Pipkin, who as Senate Minority Leader unsuccessfully tried to block many of O'Malley's initiatives.

361,"
Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. ratepayers will get a $170 rebate, county video bingo machines will be banned, and legislation to fight global warming will have to wait for another year.
\
The clock ran out on the 2008 General Assembly session at midnight, as the 90th and final day was marked with its annual harried pace and lawmakers' last-minute wheeling and dealing.
\
For a few hours, things were looking brighter for the three commercial bingo parlors in Anne Arundel County.
\
On the floor of the House of Delegates, a proposed ban on video bingo machines - including the legal ones at Bingo World in Brooklyn Park, Wayson's Bingo in Lothian, and Delta Daily Double Bingo in Laurel - was amended by a 69-67 vote to exempt existing commercial bingo parlors.
\
The argument for the ban was the machines too closely resemble slot machines and would sap the state revenue expected to be generated if voters approve slots in a November referendum.
\
But county legislators took up the banner for local bingo operators, who said their industry is heavily regulated and contributes millions to state and local government.
\
""These businesses will lose half their employment (under the ban),"" said Del. Mary Ann Love, D-Glen Burnie. ""It is a sad day ... when we say to small businesses, 'We don't care you're doing it right.'""
\
Out of the 15 members of the Anne Arundel delegation, only House Speaker Michael E. Busch, D-Annapolis, voted against the amendment. Just minutes after the vote, Mr. Busch met in his office with the House majority leader, legislators from the House committee that dealt with the issue and the Democratic whip in charge of rounding up votes.
\
Speaking to reporters after that meeting, the speaker reiterated his opposition to the machines and said the amendment had been misconstrued as ""local courtesy"" - the tradition of rubberstamping laws which only affect a local jurisdiction and are supported by the majority of its legislators - when it actually left the door open for counties other than Anne Arundel.
\
""(Allowing the machines) is an open door to corruption in areas and you are right back to where you were in the 1960s,"" he said. ""I think the amendment was misrepresented. It represented all the bingo halls, it didn't just represent Anne Arundel County.""
\
Ultimately - more than six hours later - the amendment and other attempts to exempt Anne Arundel were killed, the bill passed without an exemption, and the three bingo halls will now have to eliminate their machines by July 1, 2009.
\
Energy
\
The House and Senate had some other heavy lifting yesterday, especially with the settlement with Constellation Energy, the parent company of BGE, still hanging in the balance.
\
In order to end dueling lawsuits, a proposal put forth by Gov. Martin O'Malley will give each BGE ratepayer a $170 rebate and also forgive $1.5 billion worth of decommissioning costs. In return, the state will drop all investigations into the 1999 deregulation agreement that led to skyrocketing utility bills.
\
The agreement had been thrown into flux after an amendment from Sen. Jim Rosapepe, D-College Park, and Sen. E.J. Pipkin, R-Elkton, would have required any new power plants to come under state regulation again.
\
In the end, however, legislative leaders were able to put the settlement through in its original fashion.
\
Mr. Rosapepe said he changed his mind after being assured the state could still move forward with reregulating electricity.
\
""We have the opportunity today to put money back in the pockets of the ratepayers, and tomorrow the fight to end deregulation continues, because nothing in this legislation will stop it,"" he said.
\
Marathon, sprint
\
The session got off to a slow start this year, as many legislators were still reeling from last fall's roller-coaster special session. Despite attempts from Mr. O'Malley to move beyond financial issues and head into public safety and other priorities, the state's fiscal situation stayed dominant.
\
It was largely quiet on the social issues front, with one of the most virulent debates set on a now-passed bill requiring minors to get parental consent before tanning.
\
As predicted, initiatives to create and ban gay marriage failed and the death penalty will remain on the books for another year.
\
Speed cameras failed, but Mr. O'Malley's proposal to expand collections for the state DNA database raised the ire of the Legislative Black Caucus and was passed in a much more limited form. DNA samples will now be collected from people arrested for violent crimes and burglary, but the law will sunset in five years.
\
The public safety front did have a success in the creation of the ""Capital City Safe Streets"" program, a $550,000 collaboration of state, federal and local governments to combat crime in Annapolis.
\
In addition, Department of General Services police will expand its jurisdiction 1,000 feet from each of its 20 buildings and five parking lots in the city. According to the DGS proposal, the agency's coverage area would balloon to large swaths of downtown, including the Clay Street and Bloomsbury Square areas.
\
But the larger conversations of the General Assembly were taken over by a sinking economy, which spurred hundreds of millions of dollars in spending cuts.
\
The most sweeping decision of the legislature was to repeal the derided ""tech tax,"" a 6 percent levy on computer services that would have gone into effect on July 1.
\
After high-pitched public outcry, the General Assembly replaced it with a higher income tax on people who make more than $1 million a year in gross income, cuts in transportation, and cuts to be determined by Mr. O'Malley.
\
Local money
\
Locally, few issues were mired in controversy outside of the efforts to save the video bingo machines.
\
County Executive John R. Leopold's agenda was praised by Anne Arundel Democrats and Republicans alike as being ""modest."" Although there was some heartburn over lifting the caps on fees for wells and food licensing, legislators came around to Mr. Leopold's argument that the cost of doing business wasn't being covered.
\
The county estimates it is losing more than $500,000 with the well and food-licensing caps, and will now be able to get that money back. The Maryland Department of the Environment also will be required to pay the county back for about $100,000 of environmental testing it did during the fly-ash contamination of Gambrills wells.
\
Mr. Leopold said it was a ""decidedly successful"" legislative session for the county. He praised the Base Realignment and Closure legislation passed by the General Assembly as a good way for the county to negotiate payments from developers for infrastructure and to finish the Odenton Town Center project.
\
Overall, Mr. Busch said, the General Assembly has many accomplishment to be proud of from the fall's special session and this year's regular session: an in-state tuition freeze for the third year in a row; a new formula to give more education money to the jurisdictions where it costs the most; an expansion of health insurance to 100,000 more people; and $350 million more for transportation.
\
In addition, he said, the legislature did not raise the gas tax or pass on burdens to state employees or local governments.
\
Other politicians weren't so sure.
\
Del. Nic Kipke, R-Pasadena, headed out the chamber worried that many of the state's policies, such as energy and health care, will simply drive up the cost of living for residents.
\
""I'd like to be an optimist,"" he said, ""but I just don't feel we are going in the right direction.""

"
362,"In Annapolis, conventional wisdom is that the second legislative session of any four-year term is usually the most consequential (the first year being too early for lofty ambitions to be mounted by the newly elected, particularly when there's a new governor, while later sessions tend to produce diminishing returns). Given the recent declarations from both Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who seeks to make fundamental changes in the way Maryland is governed, and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate who tout an ambitious agenda of their own, the General Assembly session that begins this Wednesday at noon could prove to be no exception.\Governor Hogan has made it clear that he seeks to translate into action more of the themes of the political campaign that won him the governorship in 2014 -- and continue to make him a highly popular figure in the eyes of the Maryland electorate. That means making Maryland a more ""business-friendly"" state and, where possible, reducing the tax burden on individuals and businesses. Meanwhile, Democrats are clearly uninterested in rubber stamping the governor's agenda, touting their own vision, most notably for reviving Baltimore in the wake of the unrest that stemmed from the death of Freddie Gray as well as for tax reform and business competitiveness. \Still, there is much on which House Speaker Michael Busch, Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller and Governor Hogan can agree. That taxpayers will see some form of tax relief -- assuming it can be done without adverse impact on the state budget -- would seem likely, for instance, as would various forms of assistance (whether direct or indirect) to Maryland's largest city, efforts to combat heroin overdoses and provide job opportunities for individuals released from prison. Here then are some of the major areas where the governor and lawmakers should find agreement and could produce significant progress in the three months ahead: \Aid to Baltimore \Legislators and the governor have pitched so many ideas for helping Baltimore in the wake of April's riots that it may prove hard to weed through them all. But legislators should certainly support Governor Hogan's increased appropriations for clearing blight in Baltimore. Some of the ideas Speaker Busch has proposed, such as more flexibility for state institutions to give local hiring or contracting preferences and incentives for anchor institutions to open satellite facilities in impoverished neighborhoods, are also promising. \Transportation \Now that Mr. Hogan appears to have abandoned attempts to roll back Maryland's most recent gas tax increase, the focus can return to replacing Baltimore's long-awaited Red Line light rail plan so unceremoniously abandoned by the governor last year. What Mr. Hogan has offered so far, mostly a reorganizing of the city's existing MTA bus system, may be inadequate, but at least it's a step in the right direction, with greater resources needed. Meanwhile, the death of a 24-year-old Montgomery County police officer last month at a sobriety checkpoint has fueled calls for tougher drunk driving laws. Requiring all convicted drunk drivers to have installed in their vehicles an ignition interlock device that tests the driver's breath for signs of alcohol -- a measure proven to reduce DUI-related deaths in other states -- should be high on the agenda. And given that the chief obstacle is one recalcitrant committee chairman (the House Judiciary's Joseph F. Vallario Jr.), the impetus is on Speaker Busch to clear the way. \Environment \While Governor Hogan's first session was regarded as an unexpected triumph for environmentalists, particularly for the Chesapeake Bay, advocates once again find themselves mostly in a defensive posture. High on the list is reducing greenhouse gas emissions, chiefly by increasing the amount of renewable energy used in Maryland, while ending the practice of classifying waste-to-energy incinerators or the burning of ""black liquor"" as forms of renewable energy. There will also be a push to protect threatened honeybees through limiting the application of certain pesticides and protecting the state's historic land preservation efforts including Program Open Space. Financed by a tax on land transfers, the preservation programs have been used as something of a budgetary slush fund by Maryland's elected leaders, a practice that has become too easy and has shortchanged preservation efforts. \Budget and taxes \The fight over next year's budget may actually be relatively easy, given that Governor Hogan has promised to fully fund all mandated spending -- like the education formulas he sought to shortchange last year. The big questions will be what tax cuts will be on the table, and whether the legislature has any interest in Mr. Hogan's proposal to provide a circuit breaker to those mandated spending formulas in years when state revenues are down. On the former, both the governor and legislature have been looking for ways to change the tax code to make the state more business-friendly, and there is a real opportunity for a comprehensive modernization of the system. Maryland could seek more revenues in ways that would not hurt our overall competitiveness -- for example, by broadening the base of the sales tax to cover services or increasing the tobacco tax -- and cut taxes that hurt us, chiefly the individual income tax. Unfortunately, we may be in for more tinkering around the edges, with proposals for tax cuts targeted to favored constituencies by the governor and perhaps a corporate tax cut proposal from the legislature. \On the question of mandate reform, the legislature should consider the idea -- future Democratic governors will thank them for it -- but proceed with caution. Governors and the legislature routinely give themselves exemptions from the mandates when economic circumstances require. The question is who holds the balance of power, and Mr. Hogan's proposal might tip it too far toward the executive. \Good government \This should be the year for Mr. Hogan to make a major push for redistricting reform. He's got the right idea, with a plan for an independent commission balanced between Democrats, Republicans and independents, and he has the people on his side. \Police reforms \The vast majority of police officers in Maryland perform their duties with honor and integrity, but chiefs need more power to weed out the few ""bad apples"" who abuse their authority and give the force a bad name. Lawmakers this year should act on bills that would shorten the 10-day waiting period officers suspected of misconduct are given before they can be questioned by investigators and allow chiefs to suspend without pay officers accused of serious misdemeanors as well as felonies. Lawmakers also need to lift restrictions on investigating allegations of brutality more than 90 days old and extend that deadline to one year. Lawmakers should also examine mandating use of police body cameras statewide; with appropriate safeguards, the potential benefits of the devices clearly outweigh the difficulties. \Criminal justice reform \Lawmakers should adopt the recommendations of the Justice Reinvestment Council, a bipartisan group that has suggested ways to reduce the prison population through shorter mandatory sentences and other policies and to invest the savings in re-entry services, drug treatment and other proven crime-prevention strategies. Maryland should also expand its efforts to allow expungement of criminal records, for example by adding simple drug possession to the list of charges eligible for full expungement, as well as a measure that would make charges against addicts who sell small amounts of drugs to each other eligible for shielding or expungement if they're willing to get treatment. We also support abolishing a rule that prevents ex-offenders from expunging or shielding records that are grouped together in a single case if any of the charges fall outside the list of offenses eligible for expungement. \Heroin \Lawmakers should support Governor Hogan's efforts to increase the availability of drug treatment. They should also approve legislation to make naloxone, also known by its brand name Narcan, available to first responders as well as to addicts' friends and families statewide without a prescription as long as they can show they have been trained to use it, as is now the case in Baltimore.\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
363,"Gov. Martin O'Malley won a second term last week, capturing an even larger share of the vote than the one that brought him to office four years ago. There is no doubt that the election was an affirmation of the core of his priorities as the state's chief executive - supporting K-12 and higher education, protecting the environment, expanding health care access and investing in infrastructure projects, including mass transit. But the next four years are going to demand that Mr. O'Malley do more than just hold course. Here are a few areas he needs to focus on:\* Economic development/jobs: Overall, Mr. O'Malley had the right idea during the campaign to address economic development and job growth as a global issue involving Maryland's education system, infrastructure and quality of life. Republican former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. focused on small-bore issues of regulation and taxes - not the sort of things that will determine whether Maryland becomes the Silicon Valley of the biotech industry. Even so, the governor would do well to pay attention to the protests from small-business owners who fueled Mr. Ehrlich campaign.\If state labor regulators really are forcing businesses to pay unemployment benefits for people who don't deserve them, he should stop it. If environmental regulators are giving conflicting advice or dragging their heels on making decisions, he should fix it. Mr. Ehrlich's metaphor that he wanted state regulators to be ""partners"" instead of ""sheriffs"" may have gone too far, but Mr. O'Malley has a responsibility to make sure they're being fair and reasonable.\Now that politics are out of the equation, Mr. O'Malley should start mending fences with those in the business community who supported his opponent. They have an incentive to work with him - after all, he's going to be governor whether they like it or not - and he has nothing to lose by trying to find out whether legitimate barriers to private job growth exist.\Beyond that, Mr. O'Malley needs to make Maryland's long-term economic growth the centerpiece of his second term. Realistically, his actions won't have much impact on whether the state grows jobs in the next four years - witness the lackluster response to the tax credit he created for businesses that hire the unemployed - but he can lay out a framework through which all decisions point to growing Maryland's competitive advantages in the knowledge economy for generations to come.\* State budget: The common refrain of Mr. O'Malley's critics is that he was just trying to get through this election before unleashing another massive tax increase. He needs to prove them wrong by doing what he hasn't so far: producing a realistic road map for how Maryland is going to eliminate the persistent gap between its projected revenues and expenditures at a time when the economy isn't growing very fast and federal aid is drying up. (This year's budget included a placeholder for federal aid Mr. O'Malley assumed would be coming. With Democrats in charge of both houses of Congress, it almost didn't materialize; with Republicans in charge of the House of Representatives, it won't.)\Mr. O'Malley has made it through so far with fund transfers, one-time cuts, employee furloughs - and a few permanent changes to state spending. It's time to assume that lackluster tax revenue growth is the new normal. Republicans in the legislature proffered plans for righting the fiscal ship without tax increases, and they included some good ideas. He should start there and develop a blueprint of his own. Actually, he should have done that before the election, but with few specifics from the Ehrlich campaign, he faced little pressure to do so.\A key component to his plan should be grappling with the state's $30 billion-plus in unfunded obligations for state worker pensions and retirement health benefits. Mr. O'Malley has said he's waiting for a commission to report on the matter, but he needs to make this a top priority. Mr. O'Malley has come through for state worker unions on issues that are important to them, and that gives him the credibility with their leadership to ask for real concessions on employee benefits and contributions to the system. The unions have to realize that public anger over their retirement benefits is growing, and it's in their best interests to cut a deal now to release some of that pressure. Virtually all states are facing the same problem, and Mr. O'Malley could cement a national reputation if he's able to amicably broker a deal that protects taxpayers in the long run.\* Education: Now that Maryland has won a federal Race to the Top grant, Mr. O'Malley needs to become a more enthusiastic champion of education reform. Baltimore has seen tremendous strides in recent years under the leadership of schools CEO Andr?s Alonso - so much so that Baltimore is no longer at the bottom of the state's big districts when it comes to test scores. (That distinction now belongs to Prince George's County.) Charter schools and other innovative models have been a key component of Baltimore's progress, but they have been little used elsewhere. Mr. O'Malley needs to push to remove the veto power local school boards have over the establishment of charters and help provide start-up funding for these independently run public schools.\* Juvenile services: During Mr. O'Malley's first term, the state opened its first new secure facility for juvenile offenders in decades and managed to end federal supervision on others. But the Department of Juvenile Services is still the state's most troubled agency. Recent reports blasted the department for faulty paperwork that cost the state millions and lax security that cost a staff member her life. Mr. O'Malley needs to further expand multi-systemic therapy, which provides intensive rehabilitation services for troubled youth. The state is building a $100 million youth lockup in Baltimore and spending millions on ineffective incarceration programs. Increased services may cost more now, but they're much cheaper in the long run than what we've been doing.\* Transportation: The state's primary source for maintaining and expanding its transportation infrastructure - the gas tax - has remained frozen at 23.5 cents a gallon since 1992. Between inflation and improvements in gas mileage, we're paying less per mile to maintain our roads than ever. The business community has long been clamoring for some kind of new funding, and Mr. O'Malley should capitalize on that to build public support for new revenues. Any kind of tax hike is a tough sell in this economy, but a gradual increase tied to specific projects to reduce gridlock is something voters could get behind.\The theme of Mr. O'Malley's campaign was that he had made tough choices to move Maryland forward during difficult times. He's now been rewarded with the dubious blessing of another four years of the same. But this time, he doesn't have to worry about placating the constituencies that provided the funding and muscle for his re-election effort. If these four years are to be the end of his political career, Mr. O'Malley has nothing to lose. And if he has higher aspirations, he'll need a resume that resonates beyond the base of supporters who have gotten him this far. Either way, Mr. O'Malley should seize the opportunity to take political risks for the state's long-term benefit.\Readers respond\""Now that politics are out of the equation, Mr. O'Malley should start mending fences with those in the business community who supported his opponent. "" Politics are never out of the way for MOM; who are you kidding?\""But this time, he doesn't have to worry about placating the constituencies who provided the funding and muscle for his re-election effort."" This is not the end of the road for MOM's political aspirations. He'll have to placate like he's never placated before in order to maintain that support.\mdr"
364,"Woodmont Academy rezoning bid withdrawn\A zoning request that drew opposition from neighbors of the former home of Woodmont Academy in Cooksville has been withdrawn. \Attorney Sang Oh, representing the owners of the 66-acre Woodmont Academy property, said the request was withdrawn June 17. \""The continuance of the zoning request at this time is creating additional acrimony that is not helpful,"" Oh said. \Oh said the Dar-us-Salaam Muslim Community still intends to buy the property and looks forward to a dialogue with neighbors. Any development on the Woodmont property will go through the conditional-use process, Oh said. \Dar-us-Salaam, including nearly 800 families and located in College Park, intends to build an Islamic community center, including a mosque and a school, on the site. Dar-us-Salaam operates a pre-kindergarten-through-12th-grade school with about 600 students in College Park. Officials have said the community and school have outgrown current facilities over the past 14 years. \Nearby residents of the Woodmont property have argued for months that allowing the Community Center Transition zoning, as suggested by the Howard County Department of Planning and Zoning, would have resulted in institutional and business development unsuitable for the western end of the county. \The Woodmont property is currently zoned rural conservation with conditional- use permits for educational and retreat facilities. Residents have said they are not opposed to Dar-us-Salaam using the same conditional uses granted to Woodmont, but are against any additional development on the property. \-- Blair Ames, Baltimore Sun Media Group \Guzzone, Siddiqui, Coale, Loveless announce bids \Del. Guy Guzzone, a Columbia Democrat, has announced that he will run in 2014 for the state Senate seat now occupied by Sen. James Robey. Robey, an Elkridge Democrat, has announced he will retire after completing his second term serving District 13. \Guzzone, 49, has represented District 13 as a delegate since 2007. The district is also represented in the House by Democrats Frank Turner and Shane Pendergrass. \Guzzone, a business consultant, serves as House chair for the Howard County delegation. He previously served as a Howard County Council member from 1998 through 2006. After two terms in the House, Guzzone has prominent committee assignments, including his appointment this year to chair the public safety and administration subcommittee of the appropriations committee. \Meanwhile, Howard County Board of Education member Janet Siddiqui announced she is running for a seat in 2014 to represent District 13 in the House of Delegates. Siddiqui, a Democrat who lives in Clarksville, said she looked forward to ""taking the work on education to the next level."" \Siddiqui was first appointed to the board in 2007. She won election to remain on the board in 2008 and in 2012. If elected to the House of Delegates, Siddiqui would have to leave her school board seat. \Siddiqui is a physician and office medical director at Johns Hopkins Community Physicians in Odenton. If elected to represent District 13 -- which includes parts of Columbia, Clarksville, Elkridge and Savage -- Siddiqui said she will continue to focus on education, as well as issues like human trafficking, human rights, public safety and senior issues. \Also announcing a bid for the House of Delegates last week was Columbia Association Board of Directors member Tom Coale, who said he will resign that position to seek a seat representing the newly reshaped District 9B, which now encompasses Ellicott City and portions of Elkridge and Columbia. \Coale, 31, is CA's representative from the village of Dorsey's Search, and is an associate attorney at the Baltimore-based law firm Goodell, DeVries, Leech & Dann LLC. He also serves on the board of trustees for the Community Foundation of Howard County. \Republican Carol Loveless has also filed to run in District 9B. \Loveless, 54, owns Quality Security Solutions, a company that provides security guards. She said she would bring a different perspective to the House than that brought by career politicians. \Loveless said she hopes to bring more conservative spending to Annapolis, specifically addressing what she perceives as unintended consequences from the passage of the gas tax and the stormwater fee. \-- Blair Ames, Luke Lavoie and Sara Toth, Baltimore Sun Media Group \Foose unveils strategic plan for Howard schools \Howard County schools Superintendent Renee Foose unveiled her five-year strategic plan for the school system last week. \""The plan is a road map to prioritize and align all of our efforts in becoming the system we aspire to be by 2018,"" Foose said of her ""Vision 2018: Fulfilling the Promise of Preparation"" plan. \She presented the plan June 13 at the school board. \Four goals are outlined in the plan for students, staff, families and the community and the system. The goals are for students to achieve academic excellence in an engaging and supportive environment; for every staff member to be engaged, supported and successful; for family and the community to be engaged and supported as partners in education; and for the schools to be supported by world-class organizational practices. \Foose said the plan has a solid foundation in the ""unsurpassed"" work of the students, a ""first-rate"" staff and the support of the community. \More than 2,400 people helped craft the plan through forums, planning teams and focus groups, she said. \Work done by Harvard University's Center for Education Policy Research, along with data gathered through a Gallup Student Poll last fall, was included in the strategic plan. The National Student Clearinghouse provided data on college participation patterns for Howard County graduates. \To see the complete five-year strategic plan, go to hcpss.org \-- Sara Toth, Baltimore Sun Media Group \Howard police, CA to increase pathway safety \Howard County police and the Columbia Association are partnering to increase safety along Columbia's 93.5 miles of pathways by labeling all bridges and trails with an alphanumeric coding system. \New signs bearing unique codes have been placed throughout Columbia's trail system which will allow residents to better identify their locations to a 911 dispatcher in the case of an emergency. The system is an extension of a system already employed at the CA's tot lots or children's playgrounds. \According to the news release, dispatchers will be able to identify a person's location on a computerized map based on the code given. \In addition, the partnership will allow for increased patrol by HCPD's volunteer mounted patrol unit, which is made up of 12 local volunteers on horseback, and additional bike patrols for the summer. The increased police presence will serve as ""an extra set of eyes and ears"" for law enforcement, officials said. \-- Luke Lavoie, Baltimore Sun Media Group \School officials recommend closing West Friendship \Howard County schools officials recommended last week closing West Friendship Elementary, the oldest school in the county. \The recommendation came during the presentation of the annual feasibility study at the Board of Education meeting. The study traditionally marks the start of the redistricting process, which this year affects the county's middle schools. \""There's been chronic underutilization at that school,"" said Joel Gallihue, the school system's manager of school planning. ""We've talked about making better use of western capacity and we've talked about what's coming in terms of Turf Valley development. It's our recommendation that the process for closing the school needs to begin. It's a process that won't be easy, but it takes time."" \A new elementary school could be needed in the Turf Valley area in the near future as development continues in that part of Ellicott City. The new school could serve as a replacement for West Friendship, according to the feasibility study. \Making the recommendation through the feasibility study means closing the school, if it happens, is in its early stages. Board policy mandates a 14-month process for closing the school, and the feasibility study recommends the school close as early as 2014 and as late as 2018. According to the feasibility study, the school system could save $2 million a year by closing the school. \Closing the school will not be part of discussions surrounding middle school redistricting this year, Gallihue said. \-- Sara Toth, Baltimore Sun Media Group\Credit: Baltimore Sun Media Group"

Gathering of Eagles
\
I attended the Gathering of Eagles on March 17.
\
In spite of the cold wintry weather, thousands of veterans - World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, Desert Storm, war on terrorism - turned-out to demonstrate their unity behind our troops, our president, our country and the protection of our monuments that honor our veterans and heroes.
\
The comradeship of these veterans and their family members was overwhelming; they were from across the country, from the older to the younger, from those in their wheelchairs or with their walking sticks and the family members that assisted them, the family members in attendance for their sons and daughters who are currently defending our nation in the war on terror, and the middle class upon which this nation is built.
\
I met and spoke with vets from across the country and commuted with them on Amtrak.
\
As large as the crowd was, in spite of the wait to enter the Vietnam Memorial, they conducted themselves appropriately.
\
I was also surprised that the veterans and their families so overwhelmingly out numbered the anti-war, cut and run, protesters.
\
The vets and their families must have out numbered the protesters by at least five to one.

Panhandling
\
Regarding the letter opposing the Panhandling bill (Maryland Gazette, March 21), the writer's premise is based on an assertion that people who earn a living don't like to be confronted with the reality of desperately poor people and that this is a way to ""avoid this guilt trip"" and to ""hide the poor.""
\
Someone please help me out here: What guilt?
\
My wife and I each work 40 hours a week and we own a house. Sorry, but don't think I feel guilty for that nor should anyone feel guilty for working hard.
\
We pay taxes that support social programs intended to help the less fortunate and since those social programs certainly are not enough, we also contribute at our church and to other charities.
\
When I see a poor person I feel empathy, sympathy and compassion for them, but certainly not guilt.
\
However, if I see that same poor person straddling a curb or walking between dual turning lanes at a busy, congested and dangerous intersection, I feel anger because they should not be there and if God forbid I hit them, I would most likely be sued.
\
Rather than focusing on ""panhandling,"" I believe the bill should focus on the core problem; distracting motorists at busy intersections.
\
This is a true safety issue and certainly not based on any misplaced sense of guilt!
\
Whether it is a panhandler asking for a handout on Ritchie Highway, a firefighter working the ""fill the boot for charity,"" a cheerleader or anyone else (yes, including politicians waving at very busy intersections or overpasses over 55 mile an hour highways) the bigger issue is that no one should be allowed to intentionally distract drivers from what they were taught and are supposed to be doing; paying attention to traffic at all times.

Assault weapons
\
In response to your editorial of March 10, you mentioned the First Amendment doesn't give citizens the right to libel someone, just as the Second Amendment doesn't give me the right to allow the ownership of ""every sort of lethal projectile weapon someone might fancy.""
\
The question I ask is who decides these limitations for me? One person's truth is another's libel, just as one's choice of protection is seen as either appropriate or not.
\
You seem distressed that ""the matter is now up to the states."" I submit that this issue, like the many other polarizing issues of the day - from abortion to gay ""marriage"" to how our children are educated - should be decided by each state.
\
I would rather live under laws created by Marylanders for Marylanders rather than be govern by regulates passed by other state's representatives.
\
So let's have an honest debate, if one can still be had, not only on the Second Amendment, but on all the questions that affect our lives. And let's decide, as Marylanders, what is best for Maryland.

Magothy River
\
I, for one, am tired of hearing about the money being wasted by the Magothy River Association and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
\
I can only imagine the amount of donations they have wasted during their original attacks on these two island owners. Then, they go and waste even more donations by appealing county decisions and then appealing the appeals.
\
 Why don't these two organizations release the true dollar figures to the public that they have spent on this ridiculous crusade against these two private landowners who have only tried to help the environment, not hurt it? I'm sure there are more beneficial projects that could use their attention. Such as preventing sewage spills and improving water quality.
\
I would like to see how much money is taken in by these two organizations and then shown what is spent on salaries, offices, etc. versus what is actually spent on beneficial projects that actually help the bay.
\
The bottom line here is just let it go. It's over.
\
The county has made its decisions based on what the rules were at the time. If you don't like their decisions then get the rules changed for the future, but use some common sense this time.

Maryland costs
\
The rising cost to live in Maryland is getting unbearable.
\
Think about what has been discussed in the revenue generating schemes department by the Democrat-dominated political field in Maryland.
\
They are looking for a gas tax, a cigarette tax, BGE bills are going up 50 percent, Comcast has increased its rates.
\
There are speed trap cameras going up that will now assess you a $40 fine for speeding but not issue points.
\
The list goes on. Do you see where this is all going? I wonder if Maryland legislators figure in to the budget how many people they are running out of Maryland. I work in Maryland but currently own a house in Delaware.

The house is valued at the same price as the house I sold in Maryland yet the tax is four times lower than that of Anne Arundel County. The electric is three times lower that that of BGE's current rate. The Comcast bill there has not gone up, gas is cheaper and cigarettes are much cheaper.
\
I have not noticed any speed cameras there. There also is no tax on your purchases. How is it that this tiny state can manage so well with out all that taxation and Maryland cannot? Maybe this is the question that Mike Miller and Michael Busch need to answer.
\
And to all of those that did not vote in the last gubernatorial election, you deserve what you get so don't complain. Maryland politics have become stagnant. There are no fresh ideas coming in, and those that do come in quickly get squashed by the same ruling party.
\
Wake up Marylanders. This will soon be a state of elitists with no room for the middle or lower income families; they will not be able to afford to live here.

Delegate's vote
\
As represented in the press on March 14, the House of Delegates voted generally along party lines to kill a proposal that would have frozen the State's 2008 spending budget at slightly more than the 2007 level.
\
The purpose of this freeze proposal was to halt the State's continuing practice of increasing spending at a time when spending already exceeds revenues (from taxes and fees) by $700 million and when the State's savings accounts are being rapidly depleted.
\
In defeating this budget freeze proposal, the House of Delegates has set the State on a course for a major - and I mean major - tax increase next year.
\
Expectations are that the 2008 budget shortfall, often referred to as the ""structural deficit,"" will approach $1.1 billion.
\
At that point, since nearly all of the State's available cash reserves will have been spent, only two choices will remain: draconian budget cuts or dramatic tax increases.
\
The history of Maryland suggests that, when confronted with such a choice, our elected officials generally opt to sock it to taxpayers.
\
Closing a budget gap of this magnitude would require new taxes and fees next year of $500-750 from each and every Maryland family. And every year thereafter.
\
In my judgment, those delegates who voted against the proposed 2007 budget freeze were, in effect, revealing their intent to vote for a whopping tax increase one year from now.
\
As I have said repeatedly, I will never vote for a tax increase.

366," Slow Down\ When the Clinton administration's new gasoline tax of 4.3 cents a gallon went into effect last fall, it was met with a great hue and cry by the motoring public.\ On the road the reaction was predictable -- none -- thereby negating the most important reason for its use: to change the way in which motor vehicles are used and thereby reduce their deleterious effect on the environment.\ A gas tax of 50 cents initially, with an additional 10 cents a year thereafter, would have produced significant results.\ Not only could repair of highway infrastructure be better addressed, but also that of alternative systems. Most important would be the effect of reducing passenger-miles traveled, and of decreasing speed.\ Today the average driver in no way feels inhibited as to the use of the car once beyond the costs of the vehicle and its insurance.\ The proof is in the number of single drivers on the road. The cost of driving just isn't such that we will use HOVs (high occupancy vehicles).\ The real irony of today's travel by car in light of the dreaded fuel tax is that there is already a ""tax"" we all are paying in excess of the president's. And we're doing it willingly. I'm talking about speeding and its direct effect on gas mileage and the cost of driving.\ In a state with a top speed of 55 miles per hour, it is a fact that on limited access highways 70 m.p.h. is the norm. On secondary roads, too; a 10-to-20-percent increase seems to be creeping into many motorists' driving habits.\ Studies on the effect of speed on gas consumption have produced eye-opening (and foot-lightening) results. This by businesses whose profitability hinges upon the operation of its vehicle fleet at maximum efficiency.\ National trucking fleets have found that reducing speeds resulted in fuel savings of between 10 and 30 percent, depending on speed, size and weight.\ So, the bottom line to the trucking business has a message for the motoring public in general: slow down and save money -- significant money. At the pump, savings might amount to 10 to 20 cents per gallon.\ We have developed a slow, corrosive disregard for the speed limit. And we have thereby paid, and will continue to pay, a severe and self-imposed tax upon ourselves.\ Thomas Carroll\Perryville\ Ludicrous Diatribe\ Donald Sterling, chair of the Baltimore City Community Relations Commission, must live in a vacuum. His lengthy diatribe against Rush Limbaugh (letter, Jan. 14) is as ludicrous as it is outrageous.\ First, I don't recall hearing Rush Limbaugh refer to himself as a ""wacko."" His braggadocio is wearisome at times, and self-deprecation is not one of Mr. Limbaugh's characteristics. Had Mr. Sterling ever listened to the Limbaugh program, he would know that.\ Second, Rush Limbaugh has been on WCBM-AM in Baltimore for some time. Mr. Sterling apparently believes it is just arriving, since he now hears it on WBAL-AM.\ He will no doubt be surprised to learn there are radio stations other than WBAL in and around the city. I might tell you Mr. Limbaugh has always enjoyed a strong listenership both in this community and throughout the country. He is also heard locally on WMAL-AM radio in the Washington area.\ I can't wait to hear Mr. Sterling explain how Rush Limbaugh and WBAL's decision to carry him will ""undermine the noble efforts of the overwhelming majority of the citizenry."" It is clear he doesn't know what he is talking about.\ If this is the kind of leadership we are getting from the Baltimore City Community Relations Commission, perhaps it ought to be abolished.\ Apparently the commission hasn't heard of freedom of speech, and it is clear the commissioners don't listen to Limbaugh.\ Gene Edwards\Eldersburg\ Sun Overkill\ The ""profile"" of Comptroller Jacqueline McLean in The Sun (Jan. 23) was disquieting, inexplicable and, once again, a graphic example of journalistic prodigality and overkill. Two salient questions emerge:\ 1. What new and substantive revelations were brought forward?\ 2. Why do the Sunpapers, in light of the copious and full delineation of the personal woes, anguish and tribulations of Mrs. McLean, deem it appropriate or necessary to publish a front-page profile of Mrs. McLean at this point in time?\ In view of the towering and continuing absence of news articles in the Sunpapers focusing on positive and significant contributions of black Americans on a regular and consistent basis, the Sunpapers' heavy and unusual attention to Mrs. McLean is skewed in the direction of negativism and fundamental unfairness.\ I remain convinced, in the absence of substantial new findings, that the proper forums for a fair and just decision on Comptroller McLean are administrative, legislative and judicial.\ Samuel L. Banks\Baltimore\ Heroic Carriers\ The motto ""Nor rain, snow nor gloom of night will keep them from their appointed rounds"" probably was more applicable to the newspaper deliverers during the freeze crisis which gripped the metro area in recent weeks.\ In biting cold and snow, the newspaper came through at the ungodly hour of 6 o'clock in the morning.\ Those of us who want more than 15-second sound bites of news by reading the newspaper certainly salute these brave people who carried out their mission with dedication and without complaint.\ Sun management should award them medals.\ Richard L. Lelonek\Baltimore\ Harford Students and the Writing Test\ The Jan. 14 article, ""Kids' test same as the drill,"" gives a misleading and distorted picture of instructional practice in Harford County as it relates to the Maryland Writing Test. I feel compelled to provide clarification of policies and procedures regarding our work with students for this test.\ The article began with the statement that the ninth graders were taking ""the identical test that they had been using for months as a practice lesson.""\ This is misleading because the instructional unit for Maryland Writing Test preparation does not involve ""months"" of instruction, nor is it limited to a single practice test. Rather, the unit provides numerous prompts for the teachers to choose from during the instructional unit.\ Prompts are carefully designed writing assignments which ""prompt"" students to write fully developed responses demonstrating their understanding of the required topic and their ability to clearly communicate their ideas through writing at the second draft stage.\ In the portion of the unit where this year's test prompts were included, there are 12 prompts each for the narrative and explanatory sections of the test in the student materials and 15 each in the teacher's instructional guide.\ Some of these were written locally, and some represent prompts from previous tests. No prompt is identified as a prompt for special instructional attention.\ Since each teacher preparing students for the test had such a large number of prompts to choose from for instruction, the likelihood that all Harford County students were given intensive instruction on even one of the actual test prompts, let alone both, is very slim.\ The planned 10-day unit of instruction is to be offered in the 10 school days prior to Thanksgiving, with appropriate follow-up periodically until Christmas.\ No teacher should have been teaching intensively for the test since the fall, a practice which would compromise other curricular expectations.\ In some instances, however, teachers may choose to extend instruction based on student needs. Other teachers may choose to abbreviate the unit.\ In either case, ""months"" of practice simply do not, and should not, occur.\ For several years the state has endorsed the use of past prompts in instructional materials.\ Last year, the state announced to English/language arts liaisons from all over the state that their bank of test prompts was complete with a large number of statistically equated prompts, and that they would begin ""recycling"" prompts.\ They did not tell us when to expect that to happen. English Department chairs at all schools were informed that ""recycled"" prompts were possible.\ I am confident that the decision to recycle prompts does not compromise the validity of the test. I am also confident that any instruction involving the specific prompts that were on the test will have minimal impact on individual or overall scores.\ The fact that some teachers were not individually informed and were surprised to see a familiar prompt seems to have caused some confusion. I regret that they did not seek information from their department chair or from this office for clarification.\ Sharon K.

367,"Re: ""The Patapsco Heritage Greenway needs vigorous public oversight"" (The Sun, Jan. 28).\Both the Maryland Conservation Council and the Relay Improvement Association have objected to the Patapsco Heritage Greenway and its plans for the valley.\One would hope that this would awaken the public to the need for close oversight of this quasi public/private group before they spend public tax dollars on ill-conceived plans that threatens the natural beauty of the valley that they are allegedly protecting.\There is no justification for a million-dollar, 10-foot wide paved ""trail"" on the Baltimore County side of the Patapsco River.\A paved trail will clearly damage the Patapsco River and Chesapeake Bay.\There is an existing, paved trail on the other side of the river, as well as the existing dirt trail on the Baltimore County side. The trails on both sides of the river link together, making a full circuit loop a reality right now.\A far better use of tax dollars would be to stabilize the existing trails with erosion control measures and new plantings.\One only has to look at the success of the packed dirt and stone Northern Central Trail in Cockeysville to see a more sensible model.\A packed dirt and stone trial is better for the environment, less costly and far healthier on the legs of the hikers, walker, runners, dogs and horses that would use it.\Geoffrey S. Baker\Ann Hackeling\Ellicott City\Students not pawns in tobacco fight\I was disturbed with elements of your Jan. 26 article, ""Howard students, legislators launch cigarette tax campaign.""\The article made it seem as if anti-smoking advocates were ""using"" young people as pawns in our attempt to raise the state cigarette tax. Nothing could be further from the truth.\The Smoke Free Maryland Coalition joined forces with the Maryland State Association of Student Councils and three other organizations in 1998 to jointly fight for a $1 increase in the cigarette tax to reduce teen smoking.\The MASC and many of its local affiliates discussed the pros and cons of joining in this battle and voted as a body to join with us as a lead organization in the Maryland Childrens Initiative. As a lead organization, MASC and its elected officers pledged to make passage of a cigarette tax increase a priority.\The students at Wilde Lake High School who spoke at the event did so at their own choosing. They prepared their own talks. They spoke from the heart.\As a society often cynical about our younger generation, we should feel proud that students at Wilde Lake and most students statewide are sincere, motivated, intelligent and care about our state, its public health and the health of their peers.\Maryland students in the battle to raise the state's cigarette tax by $1 per pack are not pawns.\They are, in fact, key movers and shakers willing to fight Big Tobacco.\Albert L.

Sierra dead after being shot once in the chest.\Not too long ago, Sgt. Pagotta of the Baltimore City Police Department shot and killed an unarmed Baltimore motorist. There have been three other police shootings in recent memory: the Howard Street knife-wielding incident, the 65-year-old mentally-ill woman armed with a kitchen knife and the motorist on Interstate 83 who was shot and killed by a state trooper because he was reportedly getting out of his car in an unusual manner.\Last year, the Frederick County Sheriff's Office roughed up Ester M. Pena, a 58-year-old teacher on the same day that Frederick Moore, a diabetic, was beaten, bitten by a police dog and sprayed with pepper spray because of erratic behavior caused by hypoglycemic shock.\In Harford County last year, Robert Brown was shot because he had his hands in a ""defensive position.""\All the victims had one thing in common: No criminal record.\In less than a three-year period, five Maryland citizens, three unarmed and two brandishing knives, have been shot and killed.\There have been two publicized cases of unnecessary and excessive force and who knows how many have gone unreported.\According to an article in The Sun on July 8, 1998, ""Police departments in 14 major U.S. cities fail to hold officers accountable for abusive and brutal behavior, much of it targeted at minorities, according to a new report on human rights abuses.""\A group known as the Human Rights Watch, accuses local police agencies and the Justice Department of failing to come to terms with police brutality calling it a ""common human rights abuse in the United States."" Maybe police procedures are inadequate or are not being followed.\There is a frightening police culture in law enforcement that fosters brutality and is reinforcing the behavior of violence-prone police officers.\The sheer number of incidents of unacceptable police behavior should tell us loud and clear that something should be done. Whether officers should be constantly evaluated psychologically or trained to use nonlethal alternatives or both, the fact remains that this is a dire and urgent situation.\Frank W. Soltis\Fallston\Police put lives on line every day\Regarding the Jan. 25 editorial ""Using deadly force,"" Sgt. A. J. Bellido de Luna supervises the Howard Department of Police, Traffic Enforcement Section, which investigates all serious and fatal motor vehicle accidents in Howard County.\Referring to Sergeant Bellido de Luna as a ""traffic officer"" erroneously implies that he is trained only to deal with traffic accidents.\This couldn't be further from the truth. Sergeant Bellido de Luna received the same intensive and complete training as every police officer in Howard County.\He is a respected, conscientious and professional officer of a nationally accredited police department.\He has spent many years as a patrol officer and supervisor in the field.\Police officers put their lives on the line every day.\Unless you have walked in their shoes, to second-guess their actions without full knowledge of the incident is not fair to the officer or readers.\Sandy Maselli\Columbia\`Traffic calming' is simply Orwellian\This is in response to the article, ""Wilde Lake road to get traffic devices,"" in The Sun Jan. 26.\One marvels at George Orwell's prescience in describing Newspeak in his book ""1984."" Newspeak was government's use of twisted language to hide true meaning.\The term ""traffic calming devices"" is a perfect example. Is traffic nervous or upset or does it simply move too quickly? Why aren't traffic devices like speed bumps and traffic diverter islands called ""traffic slowing devices"" or ""traffic impeding devices?""\Is government afraid that speaking plainly is not to its advantage?\Charles A. Aston\Ellicott City\Analyze effect of tax increase or cut\I was very happy to see the leadership in the Maryland General Assembly decide not to consider an increase in the gas tax during the current session.\No tax increase nor cut should ever be implemented without a thorough investigation of the change in policy on the state's economy and only after other alternatives have been examined.\Of course, in this specific example, the problem will not go away.\The state transportation program will still be under-funded next year, just like this year.\Until next year, many issues must be considered: Should funds from other parts of the state budget be directed toward transportation? How can the current system be made more cost-effective? Should privatization be an option to reduce the state's burden?\These are not easy issues and certainly not ones to be addressed without due consideration.\Whatever course is taken, I hope that an increase in the state's sales tax to 6 percent does not become an option.\The sales tax needs to be kept down for Maryland to remain competitive with neighboring states. More important, increasing the sales tax will hit hardest at Maryland families. Only after all other options are considered should this be put on the table.\William C. Woodcock Jr.\Ellicott City\Columbia Council can't micromanage\Bravo, Joan Lancos.

Demeaning competent staff so that they do not bring forward innovations or other than Band-Aid ideas is not exemplary policy-making.\They go beyond micro-management.

368,"A glamorous impression of cigars?\The Howard County Board of Health applauds your series, ""The Cigar Caper"" (Jan. 11-13), which showed the duplicity of the cigar industry in glamorizing cigar smoking while avoiding inclusion in most tobacco regulation.\However, the Board of Health has concerns that cigar smoking was unintentionally glamorized in these articles. Both the first and second articles included color photos of attractive movie stars, the president and a youngster smoking cigars.\A particular concern was the front-page photo illustrating a 16-year-old smoking a cigar.

The opposition to the First Baptist Church of Guilford expansion is only about the size and scope of the project, and the lack of communication from the church to the surrounding community.

Holway\Ellicott City\Executive takes exception to criticism on trash tax\I would like to respond to Dean Wood's letter where he stated that I ""reneged"" on a pledge to eliminate the trash tax set in place two years ago (""Ecker reneging on trash-fee pledge,"" March 15). That is not true. I never called the fee ""temporary,"" and I always said it was the same as a tax.\I did call the fee a ""first step"" in a process toward a more equitable means of paying for garbage collection. In fact, I included funds in the fiscal year '97 operating budget for a pilot project to test the ability of the county to implement a weight-based trash collection system. Two community groups volunteered for the pilot but then declined to participate after residents showed a lack of interest in the project. I could have mandated the program but instead decided to let the citizens decide for themselves.\As some members of the County Council stated last week, good economic times do not always last. In this case, a clear need remains to pay for the rising cost of exporting our trash. The fee is specifically earmarked for this purpose. No gimmicks, no games. It is a user fee, similar to water and sewer charges.\No one likes to pay a fee or any kind of tax. That is why I only raised the property tax once in seven years (due to an inherited budget shortfall) and have never raised the local income tax (as have other counties). Instead, we have lived within our means and have made several spending reductions in county government.\In this case, we cannot take the chance of repealing the fee during an election year and then putting it back the following year.\We have followed other jurisdictions in implementing a yearly fee for trash collection and disposal. Perhaps Howard County should take a cue from Carroll County and get out of the trash business altogether. That is where residents negotiate their own agreements with independent trash contractors for disposal, pick up and recycling, and pay them directly. The government is not involved.\There are no easy answers when it comes to how to pay for what we throw away. In this case, we are spending the money from the trash tax wisely, using revenues as we promised and as a result, recycling more and throwing away less.\Charles I. Ecker\Ellicott City\The writer is Howard County executive.\I have been following the letters regarding the trash fee controversy.\In 1971, when I moved to Columbia, I used to take my yard trash to the New Cut Road landfill. After the landfill was closed, I started taking my yard trash to the Alpha Ridge landfill, off Marriottsville Road. I remember how huge and wide open it looked to me. In March of this year, I took my yard trash to Alpha Ridge and now all I can see are huge hills and no mention of another landfill location.\I am and have been in favor of a trash fee ever since I heard it mentioned by County Executive Charles I. Ecker. It made sense to put controls on the trash and recyclable problem that Howard County faces. I look at the trash fee in the same manner as the water and sewer fee we pay. This is the only feasible way for Howard County to fund having our trash and recyclables disposed of in a benign manner to our environment. Keep the trash fee and keep it out of the property tax.\Ronald Ledford\Columbia\Pub Date: 3/29/98"
369," Fifty years ago this week, an old-time Baltimore machine politician who hated freeway driving rose on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives and moved to accept a compromise with the Senate on what he called ""the greatest governmental construction program in the history of the world.""\ ""Through the provisions of this bill, the American people will ride safely upon many thousands of miles of broad, straight, trouble- free roads, four to eight lines wide, criss-crossing America from coast to coast and border to border,"" said Maryland Rep. George H. Fallon.\ Three days later at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, without ceremony, a hospitalized President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the bill that created the Interstate Highway System and launched an initiative that would change the face of the city, the state and the nation.\ With the exception of ""trouble-free,"" the system Fallon described - a 46,876-mile network without a single stoplight or stop sign - has largely lived up to its billing.\ It has been glorified for helping to unite and enrich a nation and vilified for helping to pollute air and water, homogenize culture and blight cities such as Baltimore. It has given the American public a vastly safer and more efficient means of travel - but at the cost of promoting a dependence on automobiles and the imported oil it takes to fuel them.\ ""It does all these great things and all these terrible things,"" said Dan McNichol, author of The Roads That Built America: The Incredible Story of the U.S. Interstate System.\ Locally, the system nearly devastated Baltimore before wiser heads prevailed. Had one early expressway proposal come to fruition, elevated highways and bridges would have slashed through Federal Hill, cut off the Inner Harbor from tall ships, grabbed the land now occupied by Harborplace and continued their way to Fells Point and Canton.\ ""It would have been a disaster,"" said Walter Sondheim, the 97- year-old civic leader and senior adviser to the Greater Baltimore Committee.\ The highway-building frenzy of the Interstate Era did take a severe toll on parts of West Baltimore, where hundreds of homes owned by middle-class African-Americans were seized and demolished with meager compensation. But community opposition put a stop to highway plans that would have leveled other communities.\ The interstates have in many ways rewritten the political and economic history of Baltimore and Maryland.\ Fallon saw his congressional career end in the 1970 Democratic primary at the hands of a young critic of his road-building zeal - Paul S. Sarbanes. A successful fight against a proposed extension of Interstate 83 through Fells Point propelled the political career of a community activist named Barbara A. Mikulski. Together she and Sarbanes have represented Maryland in the U.S. Senate for a combined 50 years.\ With the mobility of interstates has come urban sprawl and daily commuting that would have been unthinkable. Interstates 83 and 795 have turned small Pennsylvania towns into bedroom communities for Baltimore and Washington. The once-depressed industrial city of Hagerstown, following in the steps of Frederick, is taking on a new life as an affordable haven for commuters along Interstates 70, 270 and 81.\ The leg of I-95 between Baltimore and Washington, completed in 1971, has helped fuse the two urban areas as housing developments and warehouses have replaced the farms that once lined the highway.\ Regions that once existed in rural isolation are now accessible. Interstate 68, a late addition to the system that fully opened in 1991, makes it possible for Baltimoreans to get to luxury homes at Deep Creek Lake in three hours - a journey that previously took most of a day.\ ""The world just bypassed us before we got 68,"" says former House Speaker Casper R. Taylor Jr. of Cumberland. After decades of economic decline, he says, his hometown is beginning to see growth and rising real estate prices thanks to the highway.\ Even the Eastern Shore, though nominally free of interstates, feels the system's impact because travel time to the Bay Bridge has been reduced by the construction of Interstates 97 and 595 (the latter an ""unsigned"" part of the system known to motorists as U.S. 50/301 from Washington to Annapolis).\ In retrospect, construction of the system would seem to have been inevitable. The nation emerged from World War II with a consensus that a national road network was needed. But for a decade after the war, most of the action in building expressways was at the state level in the form of toll-financed turnpikes.\ A sticking point was how to finance what was then the largest peacetime project in American history - with a 1956 cost estimate of a then-staggering $33 billion over 13 years (roughly $229 billion in 2004 dollars).\ In 1955, a bill sponsored by Fallon - a powerful subcommittee chairman who served 26 years in Congress and died in 1980 - was crushed in the House under the combined lobbying weight of industries wary of its proposed increase in the gasoline tax.\ Passage of the bill in 1956 required a powerful push from Eisenhower, who issued a call in his State of the Union Address for a ""modern, interstate highway system.""\ The legislation Congress finally approved included a gas tax increase and imposed other road-user taxes while creating a highway trust fund to finance construction and maintenance. The federal share of building the system was set at 90 percent.\ Eisenhower's devotion to the idea of a national highway system was rooted in his experiences. In 1919, as a young lieutenant colonel, the future president participated in the U.S. Army's first transcontinental truck convoy, which traveled from Washington to San Francisco using the rudimentary roads of that era.\ As commander of Allied forces in Europe in 1945, General Eisenhower got a firsthand look at Germany's system of autobahns, which allowed Hitler to rapidly redeploy forces. National defense would become a leading argument for creation of the system.\ Eisenhower's concept of an interstate highway system did not call for roads into or through cities. Like the autobahns, Eisenhower's interstates were to allow vehicles to quickly traverse the miles between urban centers, not to go into the urban core the way the Jones Falls Expressway (I-83) does. One of Eisenhower's concerns was the cost of building highways into cities.\ But mayors and other urban interests, who did not want to be left out of the biggest pork barrel project in the nation's history, provided much of the support for the legislation. Eisenhower reluctantly conceded the point.\ McNichol said Eisenhower's cost concerns have proved prescient. The roughly 12 percent of the system classified as urban has accounted for 50 percent of its cost, the author said.\ In the early years of the system's construction, highway planners showed little sensitivity toward cities - often running the roads through long-established communities.\ ""The interstate system was seen as a federal program for the cleanup of slums,"" McNichol said. ""They would plot the highways right through the cheapest neighborhoods.""\ Ambitious plans to run expressways through historic communities led to a series of ""freeway revolts"" in the 1960s and 1970s in cities throughout the country - including the Baltimore battle that launched Mikulski's political career and preserved Fells Point and Canton for their eventual revitalization. But other parts of Baltimore did not emerge unscathed.\ Art Cohen, a neighborhood activist who fought in Baltimore's expressway wars, said other early highway plans left a trail of damage - although they were eventually thwarted.\ Those plans included a proposal to drive Interstate 70 eastward through Leakin Park to link up with I-95 in Southwest Baltimore. A remnant of that plan still exists in the form of a 1.4-mile section of U.S. 40 west of Greene Street - a spur once known as Interstate 170 - for which hundreds of homes in the Franklin and Mulberry street corridors were condemned.\ ""What they planned did a lot of destruction that we're still seeing today, particularly on the West Side,"" Cohen said. ""If 15 miles of it hadn't been stopped, it could have been much worse.""\ Sondheim said the eventual solution for connecting downtown to I- 95 - a spur called Interstate 395 that gradually descends to street level at Camden Yards - has been a big success for the city. His one complaint about the city's interstates is that I-83 remains elevated east of downtown. ""Now it ought to be cut down and turned into a boulevard because it divides the city,"" he said.\ McNichol says the interstate system was an ""accomplice"" but not the driving force in the decline of cities and the rise of sprawl. He notes that Americans began leaving cities for the suburbs in droves in the decade before passage of the interstate bill.\ That dream has come at a cost to the environment, particularly in the Chesapeake Bay watershed - which extends roughly from Interstate 88 in New York to Interstate 64 in Virginia.\ Lee Epstein, director of land programs for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, says the interstate system has encouraged growth by making previously remote farmland accessible for development. ""It isn't a good thing for the watershed or a good thing for the bay,"" he said.\ But Epstein, who lives in the Washington suburbs and works in Annapolis, commutes on interstates several times a week.\ ""I take full advantage of the system, and as an American I can see its advantages,"" he said. ""I don't know what it would be like to be without it.""\ michael.dresser@baltsun.com\ Credit: SUN REPORTER"
370,"Montgomery County developer Robert Eisinger says he has found a fast, reliable and cost-effective way to ease traffic on Interstate 270: Get tens of thousands of motorists traveling from the outer suburbs to switch to a monorail between Frederick and the Shady Grove Metro station.\Eisinger said he knows the word monorail conjures images of amusement park rides more suitable for ferrying passengers around Disney World than carrying commuters through the suburbs of the nation's capital.\But he said a consultant's study, paid for by him and private contributors, found that a 27-mile monorail would be environmentally friendly and cost $3.4 billion - significantly less per mile than building a light-rail line or extending Metro's Red Line. Most importantly, he said, a monorail would fit within the I-270 right of way, leaving homes and backyards untouched and sparing the state the potentially hefty expense of acquiring private property.\He envisions trains zooming above highway traffic, making the trip between Frederick and Shady Grove in 31 minutes via six stations and someday extending south to Bethesda and across the Potomac River into Northern Virginia. He does not have a plan for how to pay for the project, but said that it probably would entail a public-private partnership.\""Someone has to do it first,"" Eisinger said recently from a conference room at the Rockville offices of his real estate company, Promark Partners. ""We're looking for a way to get it done.""\The proposal has begun to attract attention, especially among Montgomery leaders who want more mass transit options included in Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan's (R) plan to ease congestion by building express toll lanes on I-270 and the state's portion of the Capital Beltway.\Del. Kumar P. Barve (D-Montgomery), chairman of the House Environment and Transportation Committee, said the potential for no right of way costs or impact is ""very attractive."" He has ridden the monorail in Seattle and was so impressed with Eisinger's pitch that he plans to hold a public hearing on it before next year's legislative session.\""For some reason, transportation planners don't seem to like monorail,"" said Barve, who represents Rockville and Gaithersburg. ""They roll their eyeballs like it's some kind of goofy proposition. But from the cost and right of way point of view, I don't understand why it's not something we're looking at.""\Gaithersburg Mayor Jud Ashman (D), who supports Hogan's toll-lane plan, said a monorail warrants more in-depth state analysis. He wants to know if it would attract enough riders for fare revenue to cover the long-term operating and maintenance costs, as Eisinger said his consultants found.\""That's something you don't see with transit projects,"" Ashman said. ""It would be a unicorn if that's the case, and I hope it is ... I think word of mouth is happening with this proposal. I think people are intrigued.""\Eisinger's next audience is his most critical. He is scheduled to meet June 4 with Maryland Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn to ask that the state include a more detailed monorail analysis as part of its I-270 traffic-relief study.\The Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) declined to make anyone available for an interview about the monorail proposal. Instead, the agency emailed a statement from Rahn saying, ""MDOT always is open to using the latest technology and innovation to fight congestion. The key for a [public-private partnership] is that all options must be able to pay for themselves, including the cost of construction, operations and maintenance.""\MDOT recently rejected all transit options from the I-270 and Beltway toll-lanes study. Rahn said the state can't afford the government subsidies that transit lines generally require long-term to cover operating and maintenance costs.\Protests since then recently prompted MDOT to form a ""transit work group"" for regional transit officials to discuss how buses could use the toll lanes to provide faster, more reliable service.\""Residents and officials made clear they wanted us to consider more transit options,"" Maryland State Highway Administrator Greg Slater said in a statement issued Friday. ""We heard you and are committed to having transit providers at the table as part of the dialogue.""\The statement did not mention monorail.\The $87,000 study that Eisinger funded, done by Massachusetts-based Cambridge Systematics, found that a monorail would average about 30,000 trips daily if it opened in 2025. By 2045, the study found, it would average about 45,000 trips daily.\If rides were priced similarly to Metro, the line would bring in $50 million in annual fare revenue - more than enough to cover the projected annual operating and maintenance costs of $28.7 million, Eisinger said.\Steve Silverman, a former Montgomery council member and county economic development director who now lobbies for Promark and other companies, said monorail supporters ""are not wading into"" the debate about whether adding toll lanes is a good idea.\""This is not in competition with what the governor is proposing,"" said Silverman, who also serves on the board of the High Road Foundation, which advocates for the monorail proposal. ""This is a completely separate issue. The focus is on getting people out of their cars north of the Montgomery County border.""\Government officials are used to residents and business leaders proposing ways to solve the Washington region's notorious traffic gridlock, among the worst in the United States. A county-supported plan for a ""Corridor Cities Transitway"" busway to connect the Shady Grove Metro station with biotech job centers in the I-270 corridor died in 2016. The Hogan administration delayed the project's design funding, saying the state needed to save money after gas tax revenue came in short of projections.\Several people briefed on Eisinger's proposal said they were reminded of a memorable episode of ""The Simpsons"" TV show in which a huckster in a straw bowler gets residents at a town meeting to join him in singing about the joys of a fantastical monorail.\But initial chuckles aside, Eisinger's clout as a longtime developer - and his self-funded consultant studies - have won him sit-downs with lawmakers, mayors and business leaders. He said his company owns property across the Washington region but nothing that would benefit financially from a monorail station. As a Potomac resident and Montgomery native, he said, he simply believes monorail has been ""overlooked"" and ""discounted"" as a way to help the region out of its traffic mess.\""This doesn't make me any money,"" Eisinger said. ""I've spent a ton of money on this.""\Even as Eisinger points to examples of extensive monorail lines in other parts of the world, including Brazil and China, the technology has not won widespread support among U.S. transportation planners.\Most monorails in the United States carry travelers in short loops around amusement parks or between airport terminals. The most well-known systems are the privately funded lines linking Disney World resorts and Las Vegas casinos. Seattle also operates a one-mile monorail built for the 1962 World's Fair.\Transit experts say monorail hasn't caught on in the United States for several reasons. Its primary benefit is being elevated, which gives it a smaller footprint and saves the high costs of building bridges or tunnels to separate trains from cars.\But far fewer companies make and service equipment for the systems than for more traditional light-rail or heavy-rail subways, experts say, which would leave governments with few competitive options for service and parts long-term. They are also seen as less flexible because monorail trains require highly precise equipment to switch tracks.\""The idea does come up, but it hasn't gained traction,"" said Art Guzzetti, a vice president of the American Public Transportation Association.\Paul Lewis, a vice president for the nonpartisan Eno Center For Transportation, said monorail systems, particularly the stations, often are expensive to build. Moreover, he said, connecting monorail to Metro would require passengers to switch trains, which would reduce ridership by adding time and inconvenience to their trips.\By the time commuters drove to a monorail station, parked, rode the monorail and Metro, and then walked or took a bus to their final destination, he said, it might be far more convenient and even faster to drive, especially if they could use express toll lanes.\Lewis also suspects it would be ""way more cost effective"" to expand MARC commuter rail or bus service, particularly buses in the express toll lanes.\Transportation planners ""consistently write off monorail not as a goofy idea for theme parks, but because I think it just doesn't stack up,"" Lewis said.\But Eisinger said a monorail would attract more motorists from the fast-growing outer suburbs, where many residents find more affordable housing. It also would carry more passengers than buses. He noted that CSX Transportation, a freight railroad that owns the tracks that MARC trains run on, has said it does not have enough track capacity for more commuter trains.\Eisinger said the projected construction cost of $3.4 billion breaks down to $127 million per mile - less than the $150 million per mile for the light-rail Purple Line and $251 million per mile for the Metro Silver Line extension in Northern Virginia.\Marilyn Balcombe, of the Gaithersburg-Germantown Chamber of Commerce, said Eisinger's monorail plan sounded like a ""genius"" way to provide better transit, in addition to expanding I-270 with toll lanes. While express buses could travel freely in the toll lanes, she said, many neighborhoods farther out were built around cul-de-sacs, leaving residents with long, indirect walks to major bus routes. A monorail, she said, would need to provide plenty of station parking.\""It's exciting,"" Balcombe said of the monorail proposal. ""It's outside the box and looks like it might work.""\Frederick Mayor Michael O'Connor (D) said he supports Hogan's plan to add toll lanes to I-270, as long as the state also expanded Route 15 to reduce the bottleneck where I-270 traffic enters and leaves the city.\""No one is saying build monorail tomorrow,"" O'Connor said. ""But I think people are saying let's figure out what a rigorous analysis looks like ...

371,"SEE HARD COPY FOR GRAPHS\ Maryland's budget woes have grown so pervasive that an overwhelming majority of voters believe that Gov.-elect Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. won't be able to balance the state's books without raising taxes, a new poll for The Sun released today shows.\ Nearly six in 10 registered voters say Ehrlich will be forced to violate his campaign pledge during his four-year term. And before granting him another signature election-year initiative - installing slot machines at state racetracks - they say they want to decide the issue for themselves at the ballot box.\ Marylanders aren't wholly opposed to paying more out of their pockets to solve the budget crunch. More than two-thirds of poll respondents say state residents who earn more than $100,000 yearly should temporarily contribute higher income taxes to ease the crisis and fund services provided by the state.\ The Maryland Poll, conducted for the newspaper by Potomac Survey Research, illustrates the vexing choices faced by a new General Assembly that convenes today for its annual legislative session.\ Budget issues have become the second-leading concern of state residents, behind the quality of public schools. Lawmakers will spend the next 90 days wrangling over how to fill a projected $1.2 billion gap in a $22 billion state budget.\ A year ago, the shortfall barely intruded on the consciousness of state residents: Three percent of voters said it was the most pressing issue in the state.\ Today, however, more than one in six voters say it's the top concern that political leaders should address during the next three months.\ The telephone survey of 1,200 randomly selected likely voters was conducted Dec. 30 through Saturday, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.\ Henry Fawell, a spokesman for Ehrlich, ruled out tax increases again yesterday, trying to assuage skeptics.\ But the governor-elect's promises - which include leaving aid to counties untouched and avoiding employee layoffs - could soon change, predicted Del. Howard P. Rawlings of Baltimore, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.\ ""I think reality will hit him and he will make certain adjustments,"" Rawlings said. ""I don't see how he is going to address some of these fiscal problems without additional adjustments to our tax structure.""\ The General Assembly's budget debate is expected to center on slot machines, with Ehrlich asserting that 10,000 terminals at four racetracks could generate $800 million yearly for the state.\ The governor-elect says his election victory over Democrat Kathleen Kennedy Townsend showed that residents want slots, but poll results indicate anything but unanimity, said Keith Haller, president of Potomac.\ `Not a strong mandate'\ Forty-eight percent of residents say they favor slots at tracks, with 39 percent in opposition. But two of three Marylanders say voters should decide through a referendum whether to expand gambling - a position at odds with the governor-elect and legislative leaders.\ ""There is not a strong mandate for slots, nor is it being viewed as a panacea for all the state's ills,"" Haller said. ""Public support is there, but it's not strong and it's not locked down.\ ""Most people see it as a big issue and would prefer to have it addressed in an election context where they would have a final say. ... ""\ Ehrlich and top legislative leaders say that slots can't be delayed until a 2004 referendum. The money is needed, they say, sooner than that.\ ""This is a no-brainer,"" said Ehrlich in an interview yesterday. ""There's a lot of dollars here. Our plan is to fund Thornton [mandated education increases] completely. We think it can be done, given the stakes.""\ Last year, legislators adopted the recommendations of a school funding task force known as the Thornton Commission, and plan to spend $147 million more on education this year.\ Voters are split on whether the state can afford the commitment. More than half say the plan should be implemented at all costs - either through spending cuts or tax increases - yet 34 percent believe that it should be delayed until fiscal conditions improve.\ While tying slots to education has much support, ambivalence about gambling is widespread. Joy Stow, a Severna Park homemaker, is among the 66 percent of voters who say that if slots are approved, gambling will spread beyond tracks. Stow fears for the future of Baltimore's family-oriented Inner Harbor. ""I can see it being like New Orleans, where they have a casino in the French Quarter,"" she said. ""I could see something like that going up, and I just don't think it is wise.""\ Needed diversion\ But James Depfer, 60, of Severn said horse tracks need the boost that an added diversion would deliver.\ ""I go to the racetracks twice a year, and you can see they have gone downhill without slots,"" Depfer said. ""There used to be a lot of people there, but now you go during the week and there is hardly any people. ... ""\ The legislature, Depfer said, should act immediately. ""A billion dollars is a lot of money to be in debt,"" he said.\ Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller concurs. ""The budget situation dictates action now. The economy dictates action now. The slots on our border in Delaware, West Virginia and soon to be Pennsylvania dictates action now,"" he said. ""So I say vote it up or vote it down now.""\ Though Maryland's political landscape has changed drastically with the election of the first GOP governor since Spiro T. Agnew in 1966 - swept into office on the strength of Baltimore-area suburbs and exurbs - the poll found that the state remains liberal on issues such as gun control, the environment and health insurance.\ Asked how to prevent crimes such as the recent Washington-area sniper attacks, 43 percent of poll respondents said stronger gun- control laws would work better, while 33 percent said expanding the death penalty is the better choice.\ Republicans supported greater use of the death penalty by a 47- 25 percent margin, while Democrats backed tighter gun laws 52-27 percent.\ Environmental views\ Marylanders continue to be strong advocates of environmental protection. Nearly two-thirds of voters say natural resources should be protected even at the expense of jobs, a finding similar to that of previous surveys. A majority of Republicans agree.\ Also, more than half of voters say taxpayer dollars should be used to provide health insurance to all state residents without insurance. Support for an insurance safety net rebounded from a year ago.\ Marylanders' desire for public spending on a range of issues offers limited guidance to lawmakers seeking to shrink the state budget.\ Three-quarters of voters say the state should not cut higher education funds, and an almost identical number say environmental programs should not be touched.\ Voters are clear, however, about where they think additional money should and shouldn't come from.\ A majority of them - 56 percent - say they oppose raising the gasoline tax 10 cents a gallon to pay for road projects. But voters in populous and traffic-choked Montgomery County support a gas-tax increase 56 percent to 41 percent.\ A temporary income-tax increase for people earning more than $100,000 yearly - a solution used by lawmakers 10 years ago facing a similar crisis - received broad support.\ Sixty-eight percent of respondents said they favored a temporary increase. Republicans and Ehrlich voters support the idea, though Ehrlich aide Fawell rules it out.\ Legislative analysts estimate that increasing the top income tax rate from 4.75 percent to 6 percent for incomes over $100,000 (or $150,000 for joint returns) would generate $200 million yearly.\ Donna Winslow, a Woodlawn resident who voted for Townsend, supports such an increase.\ ""I don't have any tax breaks, tax cuts. I have nothing,"" said Winslow, 57. ""I am going to be paying probably more taxes than the person who makes $100,000 because they can find the loopholes. I can't.""\ Winslow is backed by leading lawmakers such as Sen. Ulysses Currie of Prince George's County, the new chairman of the Budget and Taxation Committee, who said the increase should be debated.\ ""I think it is something we definitely should do,"" Currie said. ""We are going to tax people with slots, and by and large they are not people earning more than $100,000.""\ Death penalty\ Another issue confronting lawmakers - whether to continue a moratorium on the death penalty - appears immensely divisive. A comprehensive study from the University of Maryland, College Park released yesterday shows that prosecutors seek the death penalty in cases involving white victims more often than those with black victims, findings sure to be debated in coming weeks.\ Equal numbers of voters support and oppose a moratorium, the poll shows. ""It does remain one of the most vexing issues in Maryland,"" Haller said, ""and it has the potential to become hugely polarizing.""\ The pace of development in Maryland is rising as a concern: 49 percent of voters say the state is growing too fast, up from 41 percent two years ago. All regions share the concern.\ As always, the Maryland Poll indicates that voters' top concerns vary sharply depending on where they live. While the state's fiscal health is the top concern in Baltimore County (mentioned by 20 percent of voters), crime and drugs ranks highest in Baltimore City (31 percent say it's their top issue).\ Statewide, crime has declined as a worry, with 69 percent of state voters saying it's not much of a problem in their neighborhoods. But among African-Americans, 52 percent say it's a serious concern.\ In Montgomery County, traffic is the top issue, while education is the ranking concern in Prince George's.\ Sun staff writer Ivan Penn contributed to this article.\ Credit: SUN STAFF"

373," Gov.-elect Parris N. Glendening turned his attention to the task of governing yesterday, naming a diverse 12-member group to oversee the two-month transition of power from the Schaefer administration to his own.\ As many Glendening insiders expected, the committee will be headed by his wife, Frances Hughes Glendening, a 43-year-old lawyer with the Federal Election Commission. She will co-chair the panel with James T. Brady, 54, managing partner of the Baltimore office of Arthur Andersen & Co., an international accounting and consulting firm.\ Mr. Glendening made the announcement at his first State House news conference since clinching the Nov. 8 election after a weeklong count of absentee ballots. That count gave him a margin of slightly more than 5,000 votes, or a fraction of 1 percent of the 1.4 million votes cast, over Republican Del. Ellen R. Sauerbrey.\ Mrs. Sauerbrey has yet to concede and is investigating alleged voting irregularities in the apparent hope of reversing the election's outcome.Mr. Glendening pressed forward, naming a transition panel that includes three women, three African-Americans and one Indian-American.\ Professionally, the group includes three college professors, a banker, a Montgomery County legislator, a city lawyer connected to Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke, the county administrator in Prince George's County, a Baltimore school system employee, the former owner of a Western Maryland newspaper, and a longtime Eastern Shore farmer.\ Mr. Glendening said his transition team will eventually involve 200 to 300 Marylanders, many of whom will serve on a half-dozen policy subcommittees, arranged on topics such as education, public safety, economic development, environment, human services and ""effectiveness in government.""\ In addition, he will name a personnel work group, a budget work group, and an inaugural committee, all answerable to the 12-member executive committee, which will be key in setting the policies and making the staffing decisions that will shape Maryland government for the next four years.\ Mr. Glendening said that the work of the transition committees may not be completed until about the time of his Jan. 18 inauguration, but that staff and Cabinet appointments as well as interim policy decisions will be announced as the process moves along.\ He was pressed repeatedly yesterday to explain why he had chosen his wife for such an important position, and whether he expected to receive the same type of criticism President Clinton received for giving his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, responsibility for developing a health care reform proposal.\ ""Frances Anne is not going to do health care,"" Mr. Glendening quipped, one of several light-hearted replies he and Mrs. Glendening offered to questions.\ More seriously, he said his wife had chaired his transition team when he was elected Prince George's county executive in 1982 and oversaw a similar process in 1986 and 1990 -- all before most people had heard of Mrs. Clinton.\ Work as a team\ ""I'm confident about the capabilities of Frances Anne,"" he said. ""If people wish to draw analogies that I think have no bearing, I have no control over that.""\ Mrs. Glendening said she ""has a great deal of respect for Mrs. Clinton, but I really don't think of this in those terms. I'm just being myself. Parris and I have always worked as a team. I also am pursuing my own career goals, while remaining a good mother."" The Glendenings have a teen-age son, Raymond.\ Mrs. Glendening noted she was born in Baltimore, reared in Western Maryland, spent summers on the Eastern Shore and has lived in Montgomery and Prince George's counties. ""I have a great appreciation for every aspect of this state,"" she said.\ Asked if she will stay on with the administration once the transition is over, she laughed and said no. ""He can't afford me,"" she said.\ Mr. Glendening once again said he ""heard"" the voters in this year's agonizingly close election, including those who backed Mrs. Sauerbrey because of her pledge to cut taxes.\ He promised to make government more efficient, to avoid any general tax increase and to reduce unspecified business taxes to make the state's economy more competitive.\ However, as he did during the campaign, he left open the possibility he might support a gas tax increase if he is convinced that it is needed to bolster the state's sagging Transportation Trust Fund.\ Schaefer aides watch\ As Mr. Glendening and his wife stood behind the podium before a bank of 10 television cameras and a roomful of reporters and photographers, veteran Schaefer administration aides lined the side and back walls of the room, watching with interest as their successors began the first step of moving in.\ Behind the Glendenings stood nine of the 12 executive committee members, each of whom was formally introduced by Mrs. Glendening. Off to one side, seated on a couch by herself, was Lt. Gov.-elect Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.\ Noticeably missing in yesterday's announcement was any immediate role for her, but Mr. Glendening promised that would be announced next week after he has time to sit down with her and discuss it.\ The transition committee will set up shop in offices made available by Gov. William Donald Schaefer in both the state office complex on Preston Street in Baltimore, and in two locations adjacent to the State House in Annapolis.\ Mr. Schaefer was in Western Maryland yesterday, but allowed the governor-elect and his entourage to use the large reception room outside his office for the news conference and to take a quick tour of some of the offices they are about to inherit.\ The governor-elect said the emphasis of his transition team will be to develop a focused, four-year approach to policies and budgeting ""so the people know the priorities of government and know where the state is going. . . .""\ ""I am after broad goals, but defined narrowly enough that the public and the press can see this is the game plan for Maryland,"" he said.\TRANSITION COMMITTEE\ Here are the 12 people named yesterday by Gov.-elect Parris N.

Slots, casinos
\
Charles Town Races and Slots in West Virginia is running a heavy media campaign featuring alleged big winners at its slot machines.
\
Funny, these ads don't seem to mention how many hundreds - or is it thousands? - of dollars these people pumped into the one-armed bandits for months - or was it years? - before their supposed wins. That's probably just an oversight.
\
We know from experience with the lottery that slots will be a great boon to education in Maryland. Unless you believe the politicians lied, cheated and redirected the money they promised for education. That's hard to imagine.
\
If we are afflicted with slots, casinos will follow. Then we'll become an upholstered sewer, like Atlantic City, N.J. Won't that be fine? Our coddled criminals will have even more opportunities and our social costs - for all manner of gambling victims - will go through the roof.
\
Wow, what a great idea.

Supports teacher
\
As a freshman at Annapolis High School, I entered the school amidst much change and controversy. I, however, enjoyed school as much as any high-schooler could be expected to. I loved my teachers and my classes. Then things began to change.
\
After principal Deborah Williams was relocated, everyone was finally happy again.
\
On March 18, I received a call from one of my friends. She sadly informed me that Leslie Stefany had been suspended. She hoped that with my big mouth, I could spread the word quickly.
\
The smile I had been carrying was immediately wiped from my face. My eagerness to go to school the next day - to go to the class that I was to have with her in first period - was quickly erased.
\
I could not begin to fathom why this wonderful, genuine, caring teacher had been suspended. She took her own time to get study groups together and headed up the Annapolis High School Mock Trial Team. Everyone, regardless of whether they had her or not, knew that Ms. Stefany genuinely cares for her students.
\
Ms. Stefany had said that this year she wanted to teach us how to stand up for ourselves - to teach us to fight for what we believe in. Ms. Stefany fought hard for what she believed in and brought about a change, but, unfortunately, suffered unfair consequences.
\
Now it is our turn to take a stand and fight for what we believe in. Please help to ""Save Our Stefany."" Write to school Superintendent Eric J. Smith about his decision, urging him to bring her back, before more teachers are lost and more students suffer.

Service roads

My heart goes out to the residents of the Broadneck Peninsula. Having lived on Kent Island most of my life, I am very familiar with the gridlock on the service roads.

Tell me, have any of these Broadneck residents ever used the Kent Island service roads to avoid the gridlock on Route 50?

Until we get another Chesapeake Bay crossing, I guess we all have to just deal with it.

\
Del. John Leopold, R-Pasa-dena, is a member of the House Subcommittee for Transportation and the Environment, which I chair. I am writing to compliment Mr. Leopold for his hard work on transportation issues this session.
\
Specifically, Mr. Leopold vigorously advocated for the integrity of the Transportation Trust Fund. He succeeded in implementing a reimbursement plan for the $300 million Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. moved from the Transportation Trust Fund into the general fund.
\
This unfortunate transfer of funds by Mr. Ehrlich severely depleted our transportation funds and caused widespread concern that gas taxes and registration and titling fees were going to be used routinely for nontransportation government expenses.

Slots, taxes
\
Well, it has been a few months since the California recall and the election of a Republican movie star to straighten out that state's financial crisis.
\
I didn't pay a lot of attention to the campaign to overthrow the former governor, but two things the Republicans jumped all over the former Democratic governor for were:
\
-- Sweetheart deals with Indian casino operators.
\
-- A dramatic increase in car registration fees, which Republicans called a car tax.
\
Now, here we are in Maryland with a Republican governor who wants to put slot machine gambling at racetracks and make the track-owner millionaires even wealthier. And, the governor is raising car registration fees substantially rather than raising the gasoline tax a few cents.
\
A gas tax would bring in money from out of state and tax those who drive more. Raising car registration taxes only Marylanders, whether they drive 10 miles a day or a hundred miles a day. I'll bet the governor is thankful that Maryland doesn't allow a recall vote.
\
Speaking of voting: The governor believes that the last election was a referendum on slots. If that's true, shouldn't slot machines go to the areas that gave the governor the widest margin of victory? They obviously want slots the most.

9-11 warning
\
The problem with this so-called ""historical"" presidential daily briefing of Aug. 6, 2001, was that vital ""recent"" information - the reason for the alarming PDB headline - didn't appear until the last two paragraphs, almost as an afterthought, and on the second page, at that.
\
This critical FBI information indicated ""patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for (aircraft) hijackings or other types of attacks.""
\
That recent information came from 70 full-field Osama bin Laden- related FBI investigations about what was going on in the United States during the summer of 2001. The FBI was obviously heavily involved and fully engaged on this subject, if not communicating.
\
But why was National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice not disturbed by that ominous PDB headline - ""Bin Laden determined to strike in U.S."" - and all those investigations? The FBI, after all, had already discovered that known terrorists had been enrolled that summer in U.S. flying schools to learn how to fly commercial airlines, but were not interested in landing lessons.
\
Wasn't this a clue, even for the clueless? And should the Federal Aviation Administration and perhaps the airlines have been notified?
\
Now here we are in 2004 and the FBI and the CIA are still not communicating vital national security information with one another and passing it on to Ms. Rice, the national security chief, as she herself has acknowledged, almost three years into her job.
\
We have two security chiefs running around frantically inside, but not into one another in the White House with their hair on fire.
\
But why did the sparks not alight on Ms. Rice's hair? And what kind of battle stations alert would allow our president to take yet another extended vacation at his Texas ranch in August 2001?

Circus animals
\
I urge you not to patronize any circus with live animals. There are fantastic circuses, like Cirque du Soleil, that refuse to have animals.
\
The life of a circus animal is anything but amusing or entertaining. All around the country, animals are ""trained"" by beatings, burned by blowtorches, shackled in chains, and given electric shock treatment and food and water deprivation.
\
These barbaric acts of cruelty by well-known circuses have been videotaped, so there is solid proof. Animals are forced to perform all year, traveling in chains and tiny cages in uncontrolled temperatures on unventilated, packed trains and trucks.
\
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, has cited the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus for abuse to baby elephants because of rope burns on their necks and legs, and because babies were removed from their mothers before they were weaned.
\
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has a pending lawsuit against Ringling Bros. alleging abuse of a baby elephant that drowned and another that died after it gave two forced performances while sick. Other charges include beating and chaining elephants, and covering up of tuberculosis from the public. Tuberculosis is highly contagious and is transmitted between humans and elephants.
\
The USDA made elephant history last fall when it seized an ailing elephant whose feet were soaked in formaldehyde, and charged its owner with 47 violations of the Animal Welfare Act. The case was settled recently when the owner pleaded guilty. The owner is relinquishing 16 elephants to USDA-approved homes.
\
What can you do? Do not attend any circus with any animals, including elephants, monkeys, bears, horses or big cats. Write to your state legislators and your congressmen and demand they pass legislation banning circus animal acts.

Iraq occupation
\
A recent opinion page (The Capital, April 12) was fascinating. There were two lawyer's briefs for the attack on or occupation of Iraq - one a letter, one a syndicated column. Columnist William Raspberry deplored one-sided views of the world. And a letter congratulated a local official for listening to both sides of an issue.
\
A letter writer concluded that the war was justified because we found Saddam Hussein - ""the weapon of mass destruction."" That leads surely to the argument that the mission has been accomplished and we should bring the troops back home.
\
Mona Charen's argument for staying to demonstrate our toughness was troubling. Is this really what the electorate wants? Do we want to be tougher than Hitler, Stalin, Saddam? Or is she thinking of Caligula: ""Let them hate me, so long as they fear me""?
\
The key question surely is: Are we helping matters by continuing the occupation?
\
It's useful to think of an analogy: I have inadvertently introduced a bull into my friend's china shop. What should I do?
\
There may be initial reluctance to withdraw the bull (end the occupation), since it will leave a lot of broken china behind. Further reflection suggests that if the bull is left there longer, there will be even more broken china.
\
The right answer, I believe, is to withdraw the bull, apologize and pay damages.
\
Others may argue that the continued occupation is improving matters. It is for them to make the case, and say when the occupation, the 4,000-person ""embassy"" and the planned 14 military bases will be withdrawn.

Court system
\
Apparently the criminal justice system does work, but not for those who deserve it! I say this from personal experience with the Anne Arundel County court system.
\
In trying to do my ""civic duty,"" I reported a crime I saw occur at a local establishment in Deale. Since then, I have regretted ever making that phone call.
\
I have been subpoenaed three times for this ""trial"" and have yet to testify to anything.
\
On the first trial date, the public defender actually asked for, and got, a postponement of the case based solely on a statement from the defendant.
\
When the second subpoena came, I thought that this was it. I was wrong. The defendant apparently had better things to do than to show up for his scheduled trial. So, the system rewarded him for this by setting yet another court date.
\
Well, I returned from the courthouse on the third trial date set for this case appalled by what occurred. As soon as I showed up, the public defender decided that she would request a jury trial.
\
The most disheartening part of my third appearance in court was the statement made by the public defender to me. She suggested that all of this inconvenience was somehow my fault because I had no legal duty to report this crime.
\
How is it possible that my reporting a shoplifter has somehow become my fault?
\
Will I ever do my civic duty again? I am not sure. I hope the bad taste left by this process will not last long and I will again have some faith in the system. Until then, who knows?

Defends Holliday
\
As chairman of the Annapolis Housing Authority, I am a faithful reader of the letters to the editor. I am familiar with the collection of regulars who write small-minded and mean-spirited letters on the evils of public housing and its residents. Usually the letters are recitations of conservative cliches that don't merit response.
\
However, the two recent attacks on Patricia Holliday (Readers' views, March 16 and 22) were beyond the pale.
\
Your article (The Capital, Feb. 17) profiling Patricia, an Annapolis public housing resident with noteworthy accomplishments, was apparently too much for these men and their prejudices.
\
Patricia and I serve together on the board of commissioners, where she is the vice chairman. She is a remarkable person - smart, dedicated and fearless in standing up for what she believes is right and necessary to improve public housing. She devotes countless volunteer hours each week to helping her fellow residents improve their lives and solve problems.
\
Patricia received her high school degree while working two jobs to support her children. She now works for the Annapolis Police Department in community policing, helping reduce crime in Annapolis. Patricia was just selected by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to receive the National Courage Award for her contributions to improving public housing.
\
Patricia is a wonderful role model for all of us and The Capital was right in featuring her achievements. We need to celebrate and honor all the Patricia Hollidays of this world - the strong, resourceful people who, despite the odds, better themselves and their world.

Busch, taxes
\
After hearing much of the debate over the tax increase proposed by House Speaker Michael Busch, D-Annapolis, I was never more disgusted than I was by the tactics the speaker used to ramrod this unneeded, regressive tax increase down the throats of the people of Maryland.
\
Oh, but it was for the ""children,"" so that was supposed to make it OK. The speaker used education funding as the cover for his tax- and-spend attitude.
\
However, I was also never more proud than I was of those who stood up for the Maryland taxpayer and entered into the record how this money-grab would have hurt Maryland families in every economic situation. They know who they were, and the voters should know as well.
\
Mr. Busch must be stopped, or his egotistical, controlling manipulations are going to destroy this state. He has become a roadblock, both in the last session and the one last year. His personal agenda has taken precedence over the desires and needs of the people he supposedly represents.
\
I hope all voters will remember that, on numerous occasions, the speaker has said that Marylanders should pay higher taxes. This was said long before the Thornton commission recommendations, education or any other excuse was mentioned.
\
This tax proposal was unnecessary, unwanted and, especially, unappreciated. If Mr. Busch wants to pay more taxes, he is welcome to pay mine.

375,"Candidates, environment\ I attended the candidate forum sponsored by the Annapolis Neck Peninsula Federation and various environmental groups.\Lisa Rodvien and Steuart Pittman and James Kitchen did an awesome job of recognizing the key issues and presenting salient and realistic solutions to many of our development related issues. As important was their commitment not to accept development money.\Steve Schuh's acceptance of contributions in excess of $170,000 from the top seven developer donors with projects in the county's development pipeline during this election cycle, says something.\Missing the important forum on development and the environment last night in order to attend a fundraiser, should also send a clear message to Anne Arundel County voters.\We need Rodvien, Pittman, Kitchen to lead a new County Council!\DIANE R. BUTLER\Annapolis\Editor's note:Diane Butler is the chairwoman of the Annapolis Environmental Commission.\Turtle Run\I am writing to clear up some non-truths and implied character attacks in The Capital and heard at the latest debate between the two county executive candidates.\Turtle Run, which consisted of nine riparian and two non-riparian lots on 120 acres, required no variances or special exceptions. Less than five acres would have been disturbed and The Army Corps of Engineers and Maryland Department of Environment issued valid permits after their reviews.\My company and consultants, all current county residents, respect the codes, laws and regulations governing the use and development of our waterfront. This project was subjected to unprecedented scrutiny due to the pressure exerted on the county by neighbors who ""just didn't want us there.""\The county's Planning and Zoning Department performed a thorough and complete review to say the least. The absurdity of Steuart Pittman's comments in which he tries to fabricate a story that current County Executive Steve Schuh gave my company special consideration, calling it ""pay for play,"" is wholly without merit.\Pittman goes on to say that the appraised value was ""inflated"" as if a fully vetted and private appraisal company, which I had no previous dealings, would jeopardize their firm's reputation for any land purchase. The total aggregate land purchased was approximately 190 acres and will be added to the Franklin Manor Park land bank.\In the future, I would ask Pittman to please leave me out of his campaign rhetoric.\CHARLIE SNYDER\Severna Park\Editor's note: Charlie Snyder is the owner of Snyder Development Corp.\Senator Hurwitz\What do I expect newly elected state senator for District 33, Eve Hurwitz, to turn her attention to first when the 2019 state legislature convenes? This military veteran, business owner, and legislative activist will bring to the people of District 33 and to Maryland an energetic platform that will address many challenges we currently face.\To include that the working people of Maryland have what all other developed countries have - 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave to take care of family members in need, whether a newborn or an ailing parent. She will have a program for the sponsorship of a statewide oversight program that will address the widespread elder abuse and make sure that our seniors are cared for by properly trained and certified caregivers.\She will work for effective control of the public education system ""lock-box"" funds to ensure our schools regain their effectiveness. Hurwitz will improve the accessibility and affordability of the medical cannabis system and ensure that veterans and suffering Marylanders have access to crucial medicine. And she will implement an innovative and effective recycled materials management and re-use system to preserve our invaluable environment. And finally, she will advocate for a rapid and effective incorporation of a same-day voter registration process throughout Maryland.\These first initiatives are just some core issues of her present election campaign and have been accepted and endorsed by the citizens of District 33 during numerous meetings and neighborhood canvassing visits. Her successful election in November will further endorse our trust in Eve; we trust that she will do exactly what she has promised to do. When Eve takes her office after the Nov. 6 general election, all that she has stated during her campaign about listening to the concerns of all residents and to involve the people of District 33 in the decisions that affect them, will move from promise to actual practice.\DAN TOOTLE\Severna Park\District 33\In these divisive times, many voters will make their selections based simply on party or, perhaps, gender. I encourage all voters to behave as if they are Independents.\That means doing some homework before casting their ballot. Researching candidates isn't too hard when a race offers just two choices, but I recently moved to Crofton, where six candidates are vying for three seats in the Maryland House of Delegates. I've been learning about them from their websites and social media, doing Internet searches and watching candidate forums.\I now know which candidates have a record of service in the community and which have solid or spotty work or personal histories. The incumbents have voting records and there's news coverage about how they've comported themselves in office.\It didn't take much time to discover that incumbent Tony McConkey has extensive ethical infractions ranging from aggression toward other elected officials to financial fraud against homeowners. I've learned that candidate Heather Bagnell, an itinerant actor and self-professed ""storyteller,"" is a replant to the area, having returned less than a year ago.\I see that immigrant Sid Saab has fierce anti-immigrant views. My research, fortunately, revealed that three of the candidates - Tracie Hovermale, Pam Luby and Michael Malone - do have the experience, professionalism and seriousness to be legislators.\I'm told it's likely that Edward Reilly will be re-elected to the state Senate over his opponent Eve Hurwitz. If so, District 33 will be served bipartisanly by two women (both Democrats) and two men (both Republicans). I'm hoping for that outcome.\MAY MAGILL\Crofton\Clerk of the court\It has been an honor serving the people of Anne Arundel County as their clerk of the Circuit Court for the past 24 years. The success of our court in serving the bench and the people in the cause of justice is attributed to the outstanding service of each and every deputy clerk who works in this office.\This includes Doug Arnold, who is currently running for this office. He has the breadth of judicial knowledge, managerial experience and clear vision to continue the office's reputation as one of the best run clerk's offices in the state of Maryland.\Therefore, I ask the voters to continue this level of dedicated service and vote for Doug Arnold as their next clerk of the Circuit Court.\BOB DUCKWORTH\Clerk of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County\Crofton\Ron George\One of the traits I like about former delegate and now state Senate candidate Ron George is his commitment to an effective environmental policy that avoids huge tax increases or job-crushing consequences. Thus I was disappointed to read a partisan attack letter by a former chair of the supposedly nonpartisan Maryland League of Conservation Voters (The Capital, Oct. 18.)\As a delegate, Ron was the lead sponsor of nine environmental bills that became law, including renewable energy sources such as solar, and was co-sponsor of almost 300 other bills, but you would not know that from the letter. The frustrating thing about the League is that in evaluating members of the General Assembly, they choose only a select number of unvetted proposed bills at the start of each session and demand allegiance, instead of evaluating performance after a session.\As Ron has repeatedly said, he will not punish homeowners, businesses, watermen, boaters, or farmers in Maryland with more taxes, fees, and regulations while claiming that he is saving the environment - a pro-growth attitude we have seen from our current governor Larry Hogan.\Instead, Ron has pushed for enabling legislation to encourage both jobs and the environment, such as his Energy Net Metering bill, which continues to bear fruit including the Crisfield wind turbine farm on the Eastern Shore.\I hope District 30 voters will keep this in mind when they vote soon.\MICHAEL DYE\Annapolis\Seth Howard\When someone goes above and beyond your expectations, it is nice to be able to acknowledge that individual. Seth Howard has done just that.\His work ethic and sincere care for our community is apparent by the way he serves his constituents. Del. Howard placed his cell phone number on all of his literature making him very accessible. He is quick to return calls and attends many events in the community.\As our delegate in District 30B, he was instrumental in addressing a safety and navigation issue on Rockhold Creek. The channel was shoaling causing groundings and unsafe navigational hazards. He worked with all the agencies, in a non-partisan way, to find a solution.\The maritime community in Herring Bay including the local businesses and their workers appreciate his leadership. I would like to personally thank Seth Howard for his dedication and service to our community.\S. HAMILTON CHANEY\Friendship\School board Republicans\The Anne Arundel County Republican Central Committee would like to announce its support of candidates running for the elected Board of Education seats.\This committee officially endorses David Starr in District 1 and Terry Gilleland in District 5 as exemplary candidates for the office of the Board of Education.\David Starr and Terry Gilleland are being endorsed for their dedication to the community, excellence in educational support and understanding of fiscal conservatism.\WAYNE SMITH\Chairman\Anne Arundel County \Republican Central Committee\Glen Burnie\Caption: Voters cast their ballots at the opening of polls at the ""Pip"" Moyer Recreation Center in Annapolis as early voting begins.

376,"During a summer of heat domes and high temperatures, it's easy to let the sun just get on your nerves. But year-round, the sun can benefit you by pumping energy into your house courtesy of solar panels.\A solar energy array will be one of the costliest projects you can add to your home. However, it has gotten less expensive in recent years, thanks to systems getting more efficient and effective.\On average, a new solar system costs about $25,000, with most falling between $17,000 and $32,000. But it also adds value to your home, makes you more energy-independent, and lowers the need for fossil fuels.\However, solar power isn't just a good idea for the environment - it's also good news for your utility bills. Experts estimate that you can expect to save about $20,000 over the lifetime of the average solar system, and it could be much higher. The exact amount you save depends on your region, how much sun you get, and the cost of energy where you live.\In many cases, your energy system can be tied into the local grid.

377,"During a summer of heat domes and high temperatures, it's easy to let the sun just get on your nerves. But year-round, the sun can benefit you by pumping energy into your house courtesy of solar panels.\A solar energy array will be one of the costliest projects you can add to your home. However, it has gotten less expensive in recent years, thanks to systems getting more efficient and effective.\On average, a new solar system costs about $25,000, with most falling between $17,000 and $32,000. But it also adds value to your home, makes you more energy-independent, and lowers the need for fossil fuels.\However, solar power isn't just a good idea for the environment - it's also good news for your utility bills. Experts estimate that you can expect to save about $20,000 over the lifetime of the average solar system, and it could be much higher. The exact amount you save depends on your region, how much sun you get, and the cost of energy where you live.\In many cases, your energy system can be tied into the local grid.

378,"Since 2008, University Park Community Solar LLC has attempted to make community solar more feasible for other Marylanders, through the organizing and building of one of the first community solar projects in the nation and through our efforts to provide information and free technical assistance to other local groups. Our years of experience developing the community solar model made us realize both its strengths and shortcomings. As a result, beginning in 2012 and each of the subsequent years, we have been involved in the effort to introduce and pass community renewable-energy legislation in the Maryland House of Delegates and the Senate. Each year the primary opposition to that legislation has come from the state utilities, with Exelon/Constellation taking the lead.\We are opposed to the merger of PEPCO and Exelon and in the strongest terms urge rejection of their proposal. \Even though Exelon claims to be supportive of energy efficiency efforts and renewable energy, its actions suggest otherwise. Exelon is a utility with major generating facilities, including many nuclear power plants, and it has opposed renewables; net metering, which credits solar users for the electricity they add to the grid; and virtual net metering, which allows solar power generated at a remote site to be allocated to multiple customers' utility bills. \Indeed, the company continues to oppose net metering by propagating the myth that distributed energy excess production forces non-solar residents to subsidize maintenance of the grid. Measures to promote renewable energy threaten Exelon's business model, which places stockholders' interests before their customers', and profits and sale of electricity before the protection of the environment and the promotion of energy conservation and renewable energy. \Constellation/Exelon has opposed efforts in Maryland to pass virtual net metering legislation that would give residents greater opportunities to go solar or allow for community investor wind projects. Maryland has ambitious goals for the production of energy through renewable resources, and we need a utility that supports net metering and other measures that will help us meet those goals. \We see data confirming unprecedented climate change as a call to action and a reason to reject the Exelon merger proposal and its outdated 20th-century utility model based on large centralized coal and nuclear power plants, which are the backbone of its electric generating business. Exelon and its shareholders have absolutely no interest or incentive in moving to renewable energy or promoting energy conservation. \PEPCO now has no generating activity within its business portfolio and can -- and does -- shop around for the lowest-cost power, including renewable energy. In contrast, Exelon has a fleet of nuclear-powered and coal-fired plants that will be increasingly costly to maintain and will put current PEPCO customers at risk as these old plants are closed or decommissioned, should this merger be approved. \Maryland does not need to take on the risks of this utility fully committed to a nuclear power technology that, after nearly 70 years, is still without a safe solution for the storage of its ever accumulating radioactive waste by-products. \We also reject Exelon's offer to give small financial benefits to PEPCO customers or home energy assistance payments to low-income families, which will have only minimal and short-term impacts. \What is being offered, for lack of a better description, is chump change. In the case of the low-income family, the money Exelon proposes to give actually just goes directly back to its company's coffers. \We believe that Maryland and the District of Columbia need to retain PEPCO as a 21st-century power utility that aggressively reduces demand through a plethora of energy conservation and efficiency programs, and works with residents and local businesses to supply a substantial portion of its service territory's power demand through distributive renewable energy. \We need our electric utilities to cooperate with customers that seek to build distributive electricity projects. Let us all break with the past and begin to live and act in really sustainable ways. We cannot accept Exelon as our future electricity provider because that company does not make energy efficiency or renewable energy key parts of its business plan or operations. \David Brosch is president of University Park Community Solar, LLC.

379,"The big news for entrepreneurs, single moms and families of all sizes is that relief is arriving on your doorsteps in several ways:\*The federal tax cut translates to more than $3 billion in annual tax relief to Maryland. According to The Tax Foundation's estimate, ""This reform should result in 17,000 additional jobs in Maryland."" The average Maryland family will see $1,741 returned to them this year, according to Democratic Comptroller Peter Franchot. Is his party listening?\*The doubling of the child care tax credit will help single moms and struggling families.\*Companies are seeing that the tax cut has bolstered their bottom line and are passing it on. Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. and Pepco are sending $82 million back to consumers.\*The stock market is on the rise, even though it recently had its long-awaited downward adjustment. Entrepreneurs are signaling a time of faster economic growth and their engines are heating up.\Only one thing can derail your benefiting from this good news: partisanship.\Despite the good news the tax cut brought to Marylanders, every single Maryland Democrat in Washington voted against the measure, calling it ""a tax scam."" And Maryland Democratic leaders called BGE and Pepco giving their own business' tax cuts directly to the consumers ""chump change.""\Instead, Maryland Democratic leaders' idea this year was to raise your electricity rate and utility bill by overriding Gov. Larry Hogan's veto of the Sunshine Tax, a measure that according to the state Department of Legislative Services is a tax increase on all electricity ratepayers of an additional $49 million to nearly $196 million going forward.\Hogan looked out for you and vetoed the tax. The Democratic leadership followed the partisan game plan of House Speaker Michael E. Busch and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller. They saw you were going to get more money from a federal tax cut and feel they should get it instead.\The Sunshine Tax, like many of the over 40 tax increases of the last nine years, forces you to spend more on taxes - so that you have less money that can circulate in the marketplace, changing hands many times over, generating more jobs and sales tax revenue.\The Democrats' mantra is that the Sunshine Tax is needed to save the environment. They feel that this proves Democrats are for the environment and Republicans are not. Yet Republicans have helped the environment without following the Democratic model of continuously raising taxes and getting no results.\In 2015, as Hogan took office, Maryland hosted only 258 megawatts of solar generation capacity. Under Hogan, the number has grown 250 percent, to 643 megawatts of deployed capacity.\In 2010, my Energy Net Metering for Municipalities bill passed the House unanimously and was folded into our net metering portfolio. It allows municipalities to receive energy credits that are then put into renewable energy. After eight years of saving credits, several municipalities are taking advantage of my bill. For example, as a direct result of my bill, Crisfield on the lower Eastern Shore installed wind turbines. Other municipalities are using the credits for solar power.\Don't look for my bill on any ""environmentalist"" report card. You see, it didn't include a tax increase and was sponsored by a Republican.\Unfortunately, because of Maryland's convoluted tax laws, many individuals will not see the tax cut. This is some of what Hogan is asking to be fixed. But it appears the partisan Democratic leadership would rather stand in the way, as they don't want Hogan to be successful.\Ask them: Why not join him and a majority of Marylanders and be successful yourselves?\I support Gov. Larry Hogan's common-sense, nonpartisan proposals, which are good for all Marylanders, regardless of party.\Ron George, a former delegate, is a candidate for state Senate in \District 30.

I'm interested in purchasing a solar electric system for my home, but I have no realistic idea of how much money I can really save with it. Is there a way to figure this out?
\
I was looking through a publication from the U.S. Department of Energy (available online at www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/35297.pdf ) that offers consumer ideas on photovoltaic (or PV) systems, and they address this question in an easy-to-understand way.
\
There are two main factors that affect the potential savings from a photovoltaic system on your home: how much your utility charges you for electricity and how much your utility will pay you for any excess electricity that your system generates. Also important, of course, is how much electricity you use every month.
\
It's easy to calculate how much the utility will pay you if you live in one of the states that have net metering programs (see www.dsireusa.org/summarytables/reg1.cfm?&CurrentPageID=7&EE=0&RE=1) for a complete list of all such state programs) since this means that the utility must pay you the full retail price for excess electricity. In other words, they will pay you the exact same kWh price that you pay them for the grid-provided electricity you use.
\
If you don't have net metering, you'll need to talk to your utility company to find out the rates they are using.
\
The publication includes a chart to help you calculate potential savings based on the system size you install. It shows, for example, that a 2-kW PV system on a home in Denver, with a current utility rate of 7 cents per kWh, will save about $266 per year.
\
Keep on mind that any figures you get like this are estimates, and are best used for comparison purposes rather than counting on them for actual savings. Actual system energy production can vary considerably depending on your geographical location, the quality of the system and the quality of the installation.
\
When estimating the payback of this system, keep in mind that the availability of federal tax credits and the many state and utility rebates offered around the country will help reduce the system cost dramatically. And be sure to consider the benefits of energy independence as well as the impact these systems have in helping our environment by cutting down on the burning of fossil fuels.
\
Note that a number of states have written similar consumer guides to solar electric systems on their Web sites, and checking for your state may give you more specific information to your climate along with state-specific examples for your area.
\
There's one other side benefit to add to the equation. Surveys of photo-voltaic system owners have found that many of them use more efficient appliances and practice a more energy-efficient lifestyle when they get a system, making their savings even greater.
\
I'm thinking of putting heavily tinted window screens on my windows to block the strong afternoon sun. This is primarily because of sun damage on my furniture, but I've been told by two companies that the films will also drop the temperature in my home by about 10 degrees. Do you know if this is true?
\
I've talked with some energy experts about this and find that it's not necessarily correct. Yes, the solar heat gain through windows does affect the indoor temperature, and your screens should reduce this somewhat. But the actual temperature inside a building is a function of several forces, including conductive heat gains from the outside air to the interior in summer through windows and walls and roofs, internal loads like stoves, computers, lights and people, and the effect of the heating and cooling systems. In addition, the places in the house where the heat is absorbed will be generally warmer than rooms that are in shade. It's therefore not a simple matter of determining exactly how much cooler a house will be if there are tinted window screens.
\
While I can't necessarily agree with a fixed number of degrees the indoor temperature will drop in hot weather, I need to emphasize that I do like the idea of these screens since they will help block some of the heat before it gets inside, a major tactic in keeping a home more comfortable. However, it is very difficult to measure the effect on temperature unless you use some extensive computer modeling to cover all of the factors that account for the temperature in a building. Yes, the screen should cut down on the sun's effects on your furniture, and yes, it should help keep some of the house cooler. But how much cooler? It's really hard to say.

381,"GOVERNOR\LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR\DEMOCRATS\Brown/Ulman\Both the development of wind energy and the continued strength of Patuxent River Naval Air Station are critical to the future of our state.\As chairman of the governor's Base Realignment And Closure subcabinet, I worked closely with the Navy and the Pentagon, building strong relationships with military leadership.\As governor, I'll work with all parties to find a solution that ensures Pax River's vitality and advances clean energy technologies such as wind farms that create jobs and power our state into the future.\Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown\www.anthonybrown.com\Gansler/Ivey\The Somerset County wind energy project is a perfect example of why a record of effective leadership and a commitment to bringing jobs and strengthening our economy is so important to have in our next governor.\I am a strong supporter of the state's renewable energy goals, and as governor I will work to exceed them. The Eastern Shore wind energy project has been in development for four years and the developer has already reportedly invested $4 million.\It holds the promise of boosting renewable energy jobs on the Eastern Shore. At the same time, the Patuxent River Naval Air Station is an integral part of the state's economy, and we need to ensure that its work is not affected.\The area has provided one of the few bright spots in increasing job growth in this state, employing 22,000 people and contributing $7.5 million to Maryland's economy each year.\Any project that endangers the important work at the Patuxent River Naval Air Staton and risks losing the base's ability for future radar research simply cannot go forward. The General Assembly overwhelmingly passed the bill to put the project on hold and the Maryland congressional delegation opposes the project as well.\At the same time, scuttling the project after years of planning and millions of dollars of investment in needed renewable energy sends a message to both the business and environmental communities that Maryland is not a reliable partner for renewable energy.\We can and must do better.\As governor, I will make sure everyone is at the table before moving forward with major projects like this. In the event the wind project as currently proposed cannot move forward, upon my election I will immediately convene a working group to address the economic needs of the Lower Shore.\Doug Gansler\http://douggansler.com\Mizeur/Coates\I support the project and voted against legislation to halt the turbines. The state and federal governments should work together to ensure that the wind turbines do not interfere with the radar system at Patuxent River. We value our partnership with the naval base and are honored to have them in Maryland, but also pride ourselves on our alternative energy innovation. I am confident that these projects can work in harmony.\Heather Mizeur\www.heathermizeur.com\Walsh/Wingate -Pennacchia\I wish the citizens of Somerset County knew what corporations are involved in this project. I am a passionate environmentalist, so wind and alternate energy is great.\We all know global corporations could care less about the environment or creating good jobs that support a family. That is why my administration would have made this a public utility, hiring local businesses to develop and operate these wind farms.\It could be done this way. Rather, a Texas energy corporation was given the job of developing this project, and that Texas firm handed operations of the wind farm to a global corporation in Europe. Now what is the likelihood that workers are going to be brought from Texas or overseas to do most of this work?\Just look to Baltimore and central Maryland to see most contracting goes to national corporations bringing people into the area to work for cheap. I don't know this will happen in Somerset, but I know it happens all the time across Maryland.\The problem with wind farms in Maryland is that the areas fit for wind are so small, the energy produced really doesn't justify the expense of building and running these wind farms.\As an environmentalist wanting alternative energy, I think this is not necessarily the type of green energy Maryland needs. Solar is much better and can be installed everywhere with immediate benefit to consumers. Wind farms, I think, do better in the Midwest and Southwest, where there is wide-open land.\I may consider a wind farm grid up the East Coast as an aggregate producer of energy as useful, but for now this is my feeling. I do not think it will provide jobs for Somerset and having a global corporation in your community means it will take control of public policy.\Cindy A. Walsh\www.citizenoversightmaryland.com\GOVERNOR\LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR\REPUBLICANS\Craig/Haddaway\This project should only move forward once the economic impact to neighboring Wallop's Island and Patuxent Naval Air Station (in Calvert County) can be mitigated.\At Wallop's and ""Pax River,"" thousands of existing jobs are on the line if this situation is not resolved.\We must stop the practice of enacting environmental policies that put people's jobs in jeopardy.\David Craig\www.davidcraig.com\George/Aloi\My Energy Net Metering bills passed the house unanimously and were folded into the Energy Net Metering portfolio. It is precisely because of my bill that Crisfield and Somerset County were able to get credits to put toward renewable energy.\Unlike Gov. O'Malley's offshore wind project, this energy will decrease your high energy bills because it close to its usage, whereas the offshore project cannot sufficiently send or store the energy and ends up costing much more than it saves.\While Crisfield is outside the radius of the concern for PAX River, the other project in Somerset County was not.\I would like to see these projects move, as long as they lower bills by supplementing the grid. Renewable energy should not raise your energy bill; it should do the opposite, and it should be a job-producer.\My plan was for that sole purpose. Clean energy is an added bonus.\Ron George\www.voteron george.com\Lollar/Timmerman\There is much debate over the economic feasibility and environmental benefits of the Somerset wind farm. As we understand it, this project will benefit Wall Street investors and a few local property owners, and would not be economically viable without subsidies from taxpayers across our state.\A Lollar-Timmerman administration will examine all state-backed projects to ensure they stand on their own two feet economically, and we will put an end to the pay-to-play culture that has permeated Annapolis in recent years.\Charles Lollar\www.lollar4governor. com\Charles U. Smith, Democrat, and Larry Hogan, Republican, are listed by the State Board of Elections website as active candidates; neither provided responses.\STATE SENATE\DISTRICT 37\REPUBLICAN\Richard Colburn\I did not support Gov. Martin O'Malley's renewable energy legislation with respect to wind energy because I did not believe electric ratepayers should subsidize it. However, the legislation passed and I believe we should follow the law of the land.\With the governor's offshore wind legislation and overall wind energy plan, it's important to work together to ensure the issue is handled in a responsible manner. What we really did not need was the passage of what I called the ""Southern Maryland Legislators Re-Election Act"" (HB 1168) which was a bill that was supposedly beneficial to the Patuxent Naval Base.\In Somerset County, this wind farm project would be a major economic boon to a very poor county with a high unemployment rate. The developer estimated the project will generate $40 million in tax revenue and support hundreds of construction jobs.\Sen. Richard Colburn\www.colburnashoresenator.com\Delegate Addie Eckardt\The project has been in process for several years without any issues, and I voted against the bill to modify the project. I think the project should move forward, but it has been modified and it will be up to the developer and the county. The jobs to be established and all the related business activity will certainly help the economy.\Delegate Addie Eckardt\www.addieeckardt.com"
382,"Farming has always played an important part in Maryland's economy, and in the Brown-Ulman administration, farmers have my commitment that we will work with them to keep it that way. Promoting the economic vitality of Mayland farm businesses is key to building a better Maryland for more Marylanders. The agricultural sector accounts for approximately $4.7 billion in direct economic output and more than 22,000 jobs here in Maryland. Indirect and induced impacts of the agricultural sector also contribute more than $2 billion to the economy each year.\We all have a stake in preserving our natural resources, whether it is the beauty of our mountains, the health of the Chesapeake Bay or the safety of groundwater. As we work to create a cleaner, safer environment, we must also be mindful of the impacts our actions have on the agriculture industry and family farms.\We will advance our goals while maintaining the competitiveness of Maryland's poultry industry. the Brown-Ulman administration will always have an open door to the agricultural community and we look forward to a dialogue with local farmers about what we can do to strike the balance that promotes the health of the bay and improves our economy.\Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown\www.anthonybrown.com\Gansler/Ivey\I would say to these farmers that I know they are among our state's finest environmental stewards, and that our governor should be finding ways to work with them to protect the bay. That's why I have been working so hard to bring a chicken litter-to-energy plant to the Shore. This plant will improve the lives of poultry farmers and improve the health of the bay. It will improve their lives because the plant will pay them for their chicken litter and the plant will require tremendous quantities of litter to operate. It will improve the bay by keeping this nitrogen-rich litter out of the bay, reducing 230,000 pounds of nitrogen runoff into the bay annually.\I have also proposed a series of other measures to promote purchase of Maryland agricultural products. These include ""buy local"" state procurement practices to bring fresh, locally grown produce into state government offices and facilities.\We should be supporting Maryland farmers by purchasing their produce and meats to be consumed in our schools, medical facilities and prisons, as well as state offices, rather than purchasing it from out-of-state vendors. They also include a series of proposals to save farmers energy costs and encourage other Marylanders to invest in their success.\For example, I have proposed promotion of aggregate net metering tied to manure-to-energy projects, which enables groups of poultry farmers to pay only the net of what they take out of the grid minus the renewable energy they put in (by participating in manure-to-energy processes),a model that has worked for Vermont dairy farmers.\I have also proposed use of long-term power purchase agreements for community-based litter-to-energy projects to help prevent uneven income flows that result from the unpredictable nature of the poultry business. The state has already done a version of this with its Eastern Correctional Institution contract with Eco Corp., which is a 20-year agreement.\Lastly, I have proposed a voluntary ""farm power"" green pricing program that enables Marylanders who love their farmers to choose to pay a small premium to fuel part of their homes and businesses with energy sources like litter-to-energy and cow manure-to-energy, which helps Maryland farmers thrive and fight bay pollution in the process. This is known as green pricing, and many Marylanders already do it. More than 12,000 Maryland households and businesses have volunteered to sign up for green pricing programs for other types of energy.\Doug Gansler\http://dougansler.com\Mizeur/Coates\My spouse and I own a 34-acre farm on the Eastern Shore; I come from a farming family. I understand the difficult balance we need to make between protecting our natural resources and sustaining our agricultural businesses.\For too long, issues like this have been spoken about in a way that pits one interest versus another. We don't have to choose between them; we can support policies that help both goals succeed.\Protecting the health of the Chesapeake Bay will always be a priority to me. We cannot have a vibrant economy on the Eastern Shore without a healthy bay. But we also know we cannot have a healthy bay without a vibrant Eastern Shore. These issues are complementary, not at odds.\I will always be transparent about why I propose certain policies to protect the Chesapeake -- and I will work tirelessly to have diverse voices around the table to determine ways to mitigate any potential harm to small family farms on the Eastern Shore.\A clean bay starts with what flows into it, and I am committed to cleaning up our streams and waterways. It is going to be a long, difficult road, but it is not impossible to bring the bay back to a healthier place. By boosting oyster populations, we will improve the local economy for watermen, while also benefiting from oyster water filtration.\My administration will ensure more land conservation around the bay to minimize the impervious surfaces that contribute to pollution runoff. We will incentivize the creation of green infrastructure to mimic the natural water and ecological cycle, to reduce and recycle stormwater pollution.\The Sierra Club and its 12,000 members statewide trust me to get the job done -- largely because of the same legislative record that led to The Baltimore Sun calling me ""one of the leading environmental advocates in the General Assembly."" Cleaning up the bay and its tributary system has to be our top environmental priority.\Heather Mizeur\www.heathermizeur.com\Walsh/Wingate-Pennacchia\The reason poultry has made the news for pollution and federal oversight is because industrial meat has super--sized the environmental damage and harms community health.\Small farmers know how to keep the land healthy and produce quality food. My grandfather was a waterman and farmer with a farm right on the Chesapeake Bay. I know he did not use or produce large amounts of chemicals and contaminants. He simply produced what he needed and sold to surrounding areas.\Contract farmers with industrial chicken corporations are forced to take and use chicken waste for example to mitigate costs for this industrial corporation, then are held responsible for the added distress on the environment. This is not good public policy.\If we base our economy on domestic businesses producing locally then the environmental problems go away.\Maryland and the federal government are not wrong to try to stop this environmental problem; they are not regulating the big guys and coming after the smaller businesses, that is the problem.\Cindy A.

385,"
Here in Annapolis, sea-level rise fueled by climate change is a big threat to our local economy.
\
Fortunately, our state legislators can directly address climate change's rising costs - and in the process expand business opportunities that create high-paying Maryland jobs - by passing the Maryland Clean Energy Advancement Act this year.
\
Moving forward with this legislation would increase our state's clean electricity requirement, also known as a Renewable Portfolio Standard, or RPS. Increasing the standard to 25 percent by 2020, then to 40 percent by 2025, would grow our economy by sending a clear market signal to the private sector that Maryland wants to seize clean energy leadership in the region.
\
This competitive advantage would attract more innovative, job-creating energy efficiency and renewable energy companies. These companies would crank up more clean, homegrown electricity from abundant renewable resources like wind and sunshine. In the process, they'd also create more jobs.
\
Maryland's current RPS was signed into law a decade ago by Republican Gov. Bob Ehrlich. By stipulating that our state generate a fifth of our electricity from renewables by 2022, the RPS currently on the books has helped Maryland's clean energy industry get off the ground. Maryland's solar industry, for example, already employs about 2,000 workers at more than 130 companies, according to The Solar Foundation.
\
If we continue to enact common-sense energy policies like the Maryland Clean Energy Advancement Act, this would just be the beginning of our job growth.
\
According to Environmental Entrepreneurs, the national nonpartisan business group where I work, nearly a quarter-million clean energy jobs have been announced across the country the last three years alone. Doubling Maryland's RPS could create 18,000 direct new jobs in the region's wind energy supply chain, and this is on top of the 1,700 solar jobs that would be added to Maryland's economy annually.
\
Meanwhile, choosing to increase our investments in energy efficiency would save us all money and create thousands of additional middle-income jobs.
\
So what do clean energy and energy efficiency jobs look like?
\
They're construction jobs weatherizing school districts so tightly that superintendents use energy savings to hire additional teachers.
\
They're jobs manufacturing metal racks for solar panels, trucking them cross-country, and installing them on homes sheltering families who live on military bases throughout the Mid-Atlantic.
\
They're jobs in Cambridge, where OneEnergy Renewables CEO Bryce Smith, a Seattle-based E2 member and Maryland native, worked with a farmer to lease 20 acres of his least productive land to develop a commercial-scale solar project.
\
The farmer had experimented with other ways to profit off the 20 acres, including a nine-hole golf course. Solar made the most sense.
\
Through a 25-year agreement with Constellation Energy, this project will generate income for the farmer, create dozens of Eastern Shore construction jobs, and sell predictably priced electricity to Baltimore's National Aquarium for decades to come.
\
Setting the region's highest clean energy goals would establish Maryland as the Mid-Atlantic's premier hub for clean energy jobs and investments. It would prove we're acting on climate-related economic warnings sounded by business leaders like former Bechtel President George Schultz and former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson in their ""Risky Business"" report.
\
Acting on climate empowers us to grow and protect our economy. While no policy on its own turns back the Chesapeake's rising tide, we must call upon our legislators - right now - to do all they can.
\
For the good of Maryland's economy, our lawmakers must pass the Maryland Clean Energy Advancement Act.

386," GIVEN THE great budget crisis in Annapolis and new potential for partisan disagreement, it's good to know there's one bill almost everyone can support in this General Assembly.\ The legislation would bring more than $500 million worth of economic development to Maryland's poorest counties. It would simultaneously help foster energy security, clean our air, combat global warming and lead to significant potential savings to millions of Maryland electricity users.\ Best of all, this bill wouldn't cost taxpayers a penny, which is partly why it has strong support from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Annapolis and from nearly 70 percent of likely voters across the state, according to independent polling.\ What is this legislation? It's a clean energy bill, called the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) law. Simply put, the RPS bill would require that Maryland utilities obtain a modest 7.5 percent of their electricity from clean renewable sources such as wind, solar and geothermal by 2013. Fourteen states, including nearby New Jersey and New York, already have such laws.\ By guaranteeing demand for clean, home-grown energy, the RPS bill helps the renewable energy industry grow stronger and lower its prices. This, in turn, makes America more energy independent just as global oil and natural gas supplies are shrinking and becoming more prone to terrorist attack.\ This bill also would stimulate lots of economic investment right where Maryland needs it most.\ The most cost-effective and fastest-growing renewable energy source is wind power, and the economically depressed counties of Western Maryland hold most of the state's wind resources. A wind farm planned for mountainous Garrett County would create 174 construction jobs and, by itself, become one of the biggest single taxpayers in the county, providing millions of dollars for hospitals, schools and roads.\ For these reasons, the delegation of senators and delegates from western-most Maryland - most of them Republicans - strongly support this bill.\ Simply put, this is a pro-business piece of legislation. Even oil giant Texas passed an RPS bill under then-Gov. George W. Bush in 1999. The result? Well over $1 billion worth of wind farm development in Texas in three years.\ Despite these benefits, some electric utilities have opposed RPS legislation in the past, fearing it would raise electricity rates. But in the 14 states with RPS laws now, there's no evidence that the legislation has led to a single rate hike. Indeed, a growing number of utilities across the nation strongly support such laws, and utilities in Texas that once fought the law now buy more wind power than required by the legislation.\ Of course, wind power is still slightly more expensive than natural gas-fired electricity (the source of most new electricity generation). But the price of natural gas is extremely volatile and is projected to rise dramatically in coming years. Wind is free, meaning wind farms can simply factor in the cost of wind mill construction and maintenance, and then offer utilities gloriously fixed 15-year contracts. This makes wind a valuable hedge against large future spikes in natural gas prices, thus protecting customers.\ Finally, let's not forget that renewable energy is good for the environment. With enough growth, clean power would help reduce acid rain, skyrocketing asthma rates, and emissions of greenhouse gases. And it would help preserve our wondrous Chesapeake Bay.\ Wind farms and other renewable energy facilities, of course, must be properly sited to prevent impacts on bird populations and mountain ecosystems, and this bill contains language guaranteeing proper protection.\ It's rare, especially in a period of fiscal austerity, that a bill comes along with something for everyone: environmentalists and industry, Democrats and Republicans, poor counties and general consumers.\ For the sake of all Marylanders, we encourage the House of Delegates and Senate to promptly pass the RPS bill. We will then encourage Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., like Governor Bush before him, to sign it into law.\ Kumar Barve, a Democrat from Montgomery County, is majority leader of the Maryland House of Delegates. Delores Kelley is a Democrat who represents Baltimore in the Maryland Senate. Neither of them is a sponsor of the RPS bill."
387,"For more than two years, environmentalists and community groups have been loudly fighting TransCanada's plan to build a natural gas pipeline from Bedford, Pa. to Berkeley Springs, W. Va. by way of Hancock in Western Maryland and underneath the Potomac River. They argued that Maryland had nothing to gain from the project and much to lose - particularly if the water supply was threatened by a potential leak - and that, fundamentally, the pipeline promoted Marcellus Shale fracking, which the state had banned in 2017 because of the damage it can do to the environment. Yet the Hogan administration seemed, at best, noncommittal on the subject.\All that changed last week when the Board of Public Works voted unanimously not to grant a necessary easement for the project. Opposition from Comptroller Peter Franchot and Treasurer Nancy Kopp was not a big surprise to opponents, as both had indicated concerns about the project after a recent public hearing. But Gov. Larry Hogan's vote was not so certain - and not especially well explained during the meeting either. Among his more inscrutable quotes: ""We were always to have a 3-nothing vote"" and that his opposition ""had nothing to do with any letter from the legislature."" That last remark referred to a letter from 60 legislators asking the board to reject the pipeline.\There are really just two possibilities. Either Mr. Hogan read the political tea leaves and jumped on the bandwagon rather than get run over by it, or he sincerely has concerns about the wisdom of risking so much for little to no reward. Perhaps it was a bit of both. His spokeswoman says it was a case of the governor determining that ""the economic benefits did not outweigh the environmental risks in this instance.""\Whatever the case, this is not the last time the Hogan administration will have to deal with the difficult subject of fracking or pipelines or an appropriate energy policy in light of climate change. Not only might TransCanada take the state to court over the pipeline but so might the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which approved the project last summer without the conditions the Maryland Department of the Environment had sought to place on it. And there are other related policy questions about to be explored by the Maryland General Assembly when it reconvenes today.\The most obvious is what to do about the Maryland Clean Energy Jobs Act, which would require that at least half the electricity used in the state come from renewable sources by 2030 and mandate the development of a plan for 100 percent renewable energy by 2040. It's an ambitious proposal but one that now seems inevitable given that 30 incoming state senators and 82 newly-elected members of the House of Delegates (a majority of both chambers) have indicated their support, at least according to the bill's advocates. On this subject, Mr. Hogan has also been somewhat quiet as well, expressing neither opposition nor support. In 2016, he vetoed a far more modest bill that set what is technically known as the Renewable Portfolio Standard at 25 percent, calling it a ""sunshine tax.""Lawmakers subsequently overrode the veto, and Mr. Hogan's language on the subject changed markedly - in the 2018 election Mr. Hogan didn't complain about RPS policy at all.\Yet experts say Maryland can't reduce its greenhouse gas emissions as planned (40 percent less carbon dioxide by 2030) without a 50 percent RPS. That's not just environmentalists talking; that's what the state's own consultants have concluded as well. Meanwhile, lawmakers will grapple over what to do about similar gas pipeline projects in the future. How serious is Maryland about reducing greenhouse gas emissions or preventing harmful chemicals used in fracking from entering the water supply if it enables fracking in surrounding states? Advocates want Maryland to commit to more closely regulating pipelines as neighboring Virginia has already done.\That seems reasonable - and Mr. Hogan ought to get on board early. It's one thing to sign legislation when it crosses his desk, it's another to be pushing for the measures at the committee and subcommittee level. The governor's spokeswoman says Mr. Hogan is waiting to see how the measures ""take shape and what exactly is being proposed."" But he ought to be doing more than sitting and waiting. MDE Secretary Ben Grumbles should to be in the trenches asking lawmakers to support stronger renewable energy standards and to commit to pipeline reviews under Section 401 authority of the Clean Water Act. After all, Mr. Hogan has gotten considerable notice for his opposition to President Donald Trump's climate change denials and obfuscations. He might even have higher political aspirations. How better to demonstrate that a moderate Republican can be pragmatic environmentalist than to support a sensible approach to fossil fuels that protects natural resources and promotes solar, wind and similar green energy sources?"
388," THE PARTY'S over for electric deregulation. The question is, will Maryland consumers get stuck cleaning up the mess?\ When he led the fight to pass deregulation legislation in 1999, Sen. Thomas L. Bromwell Jr., a Baltimore County Democrat, erroneously declared that the bill was a ""well-balanced blueprint for change, with carefully crafted protections for consumers, businesses, utilities and the environment."" What Maryland got was a money-making dream for utilities. But it's looking like a nightmare for the state's consumers.\ To Senator Bromwell and his corporate backers, including utility giant Baltimore Gas and Electric Co., Maryland in 1999 was about to enter an era of huge profits and taxpayer handouts for the utilities, with a few small bones thrown to consumers to keep them quiet. These bones included a minor rate cut and, more importantly, ""electric choice"" - the ability to choose an electric supplier from a variety of competing companies.\ But the deregulation bubble has burst.\ The Maryland Office of People's Counsel (OPC), an independent state agency that represents residential customers in utility issues, released a report in January that has exploded the myths of Mr. Bromwell's deregulation scheme. Titled the ""Report on Electric Choice,"" it includes some very unsettling findings, one of which is that deregulation has failed to provide consumers with the benefits that Mr. Bromwell and BGE touted.\ ""Thus far, Maryland's deregulation experience has not produced the expected results ... [consumers] have seen no real savings from competitive retail electric markets and have no real opportunities to switch between electricity suppliers,"" the report said.\ Worse, in the next two to four years, Maryland consumers will lose the one thing standing between them and out-of-control, California- style electric rates - a state-imposed price cap. The OPC, understanding the implications of this, recommends that lawmakers extend the price caps until such time as the energy market is ""mature"" enough to prevent power companies from artificially jacking up prices.\ For example, last summer, the spot price for electricity went up to 25 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) at times, but consumers paid just 5 cents per kWh because of price caps. If our legislators don't take action quickly, a ""California crisis,"" with its 500 percent electric bill increases, is just around the corner.\ Senator Bromwell was wrong about deregulation having benefits for consumers, and he's wrong about its effects on the environment. Many of the states that adopted deregulation also adopted a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), a requirement for electricity providers to get a specified percentage of electricity from clean, renewable resources such as wind and the sun. This was done to offset potential environmental harm and ensure a diversity of energy sources.\ But Mr. Bromwell and his corporate backers shot down every effort to adopt an RPS. He blocked an effort in 2000, claiming that deregulation needed time to work, and he did the same thing again last year. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency is telling Maryland that its air and water can't take further pollution. But because of Mr. Bromwell's deregulation, out-of-state power companies are free to build polluting power plants in Maryland.\ Price caps should be kept on electricity.\ Gary Skulnik campaigns for clean energy solutions to global warming problems and works for Greenpeace. He lives in Silver Spring."
389,"
The District's record heatwave, with temperatures lingering around the 100-degree mark, has spurred D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) to sign legislation requiring Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) to procure 50 percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2032 for its customers in the city, and 5 percent of its electricity from solar cells.
\
""This week's extreme heat and our volatile weather, including last week's hail storm and this winter's blizzard, are examples of the impacts climate change will continue to have on our city and the planet,"" said Department of Energy and Environment Director Tommy Wells in a press release. ""The Renewable Portfolio Standard bill expands the set of tools we need to address and mitigate the effects of climate change in the District and will help keep us on track to meet our Sustainable DC goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent and to ensure renewables make up at least 50 percent of the District's energy supply by 2032.""
\
City officials estimate that the plans for low-income solar will create at least 100 jobs in the first year alone, and this follows an agreement between the city and non-profit GRID Alternatives to provide young residents of D.C. with paid training in solar panel installation, energy efficiency, and safety and construction skills.
\
This is a substantial increase on the city's previous target of 20 percent by 2020, and gives Washington D.C. the fifth-strongest renewable portfolio standard (RPS) policy in the United States, after Hawaii (100 percent by 2045), Vermont (75 percent by 2032), California and New York (both 50 percent by 2030). It positions the city ahead of Oregon, which increased its RPS to 50 percent by 2040 for large investor-owned utilities last year.
\
As part of the program, the city plans to install solar panels on 6,000 low-income homes annually, and reach over 100,000 low-income homes by 2032.
\
The new law also raises new penalties should PEPCO not comply with the mandate in any given year. According to current legislation, Bill 21-650: ""If an electricity supplier fails to comply with the renewable energy portfolio standard for the applicable year, the electricity supplier must pay a compliance fee of fifty cents 2011-2016,35 cents in 2017, 30 cents in 2018, and 20 cents in 2019-2020 for each kilowatt-hour of shortfall from required solar energy sources. This would be increased to fifty cents per kilowatt-hour 2016-2023, and 40 cents per kilowatt-hour between 2024-2028 .""

390,"Md. is making bad choices for the environment\Thanks to Tim Wheeler for his article, ""Turbines in the Wind"" (Jan 28). \The wind industry in Western Maryland is just the latest in the litany of industries despoiling their natural resources and landscapes. First, the timber industry denuded the forests, resulting in massive sedimentation of streams. Next came deep coal mines that even today require lime dosers to neutralize the acid drainage. Next, strip mining of coal from the surfaces of land, requiring revegetation that often dies from the acidic soil. \Now we have the wind industry working its will with promises of taxes to help fund schools (not unlike the gambling industry). In the case of wind, the destruction is to a scarce commodity, mountaintop interior forests that provide necessary habitats for a number of rare and endangered species. \In the case of Wayne Rogers' first project at Roth Rock, several of the proposed sites failed environmental review. He then got the legislature to change the rules, reapplied and secured the project without the review. He expects to do so again at Four-Mile Ridge. \What is driving this industry madness toward such destructive projects, aside from greed and tax subsidies? In the case of wind, it is Maryland's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) law that stipulates that by 2022, Maryland must produce 20 percent of its energy from renewables or the industry must pay a fine. It is doubtful that the goal will be met. \In New Hampshire, there is a move to repeal their RPS law because the utilities can't meet the goal and instead are paying the fines. Subsequently, they are charging their customers the amount of the fines without producing any energy. Several other states have either already repealed or are about to repeal their RPS bills. \Maryland take heed! \Ajax Eastman, Baltimore \VA woes: Where were Md.'s elected officials? \It almost makes you laugh. Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger says that the situation at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in Baltimore ""is and has been unacceptable for years"" (""Officials demand answers from VA,"" Jan 29). \Well, if it has been that way, then where has he, and U.S. Sens. Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin been? They claim to be so concerned but have apparently paid little interest in the complaints by the veterans. \The situation could be fixed by firing everyone in that office and replacing them with serious, concerned individuals who obviously care about our vets. See what happens. \F. Cordell \Vegan diet not so risky as the status quo \Over dinner the other day with a new acquaintance, the topic of food and ethics (and thus vegetarianism) came up. My new acquaintance, Mr. W., is about 60 pounds overweight and was enjoying an oversized cheeseburger on a white bun with a side of fries. He informed me, in all seriousness, that vegetarian diets are risky due to the likelihood of nutrient deficiency. Had Mr. W. read the recent article in The Sun (""Tips on switching to a vegan diet,"" Jan. 24), he may have cited it as evidence to support his claim. \I appreciate the intention of the article but I'm afraid readers may feel defeated from the start. They might conclude that switching to a vegan diet takes too much planning and too much work and that, by not making the change, they needn't worry about proper nutrition. The article fails to point out that most Americans are already nutritionally compromised eating the Standard American Diet (SAD), a diet that actually includes excessive meat and protein, not to mention a lot of processed foods. On the contrary, the article seems to paint the picture that most diet change candidates are moving from a nutritionally sound diet that happens to include some animal products to a potentially inadequate plant-based diet. This is likely not the reality. Most of those contemplating a switch are probably already eating a nutrient-poor diet and, regardless of whether or not they move toward plant-based eating, they most likely need to make significant changes in order to ensure proper nutrition. Just as it is a mistake to assume that a vegan diet is always a healthy diet, there is no reason to assume that an omnivorous diet is a healthy diet. \Many who believe they should switch to a plant-based diet don't really want to -- not because they fear health consequences but because they fear feeling deprived. People in this situation are likely to seize any available excuse for avoiding the change and may find all the ingredients for confirmation bias right here in this article. Many will likely decide that they don't have the time or the energy to plan a vegan diet safely and can therefore continue to enjoy their current eating habits while feeling like they made a rational choice. \Jennifer Haga, Prince Frederick\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
391,"LUKE, Md. \The paper mill hulks over a bend in the Potomac River Valley, a castle of pale blue metal between steep green slopes. Clouds of steam billow from its towers.\The Luke Mill, the largest employer in this tiny town, has powered the economy in this corner of Appalachia for generations, producing paper for countless Campbell's soup labels and glossy covers for National Geographic and Playboy.\Even as other factories in this stretch of Western Maryland have closed down, this mill has managed to survive.\That's in part because the 10-story-high boiler deep inside the mill burns a sludge known as black liquor.\The substance, a mix of caustic chemicals and wood waste left over from the paper-making process, was once pollution, a byproduct that fouled the rocky banks of the Potomac.\Now Maryland calls it green energy.\It's not a particularly clean form of energy. Burning black liquor releases carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that causes climate change.\But because it's a waste product being used to generate power, state legislators declared it a renewable energy source. So the paper mill gets millions of ratepayer dollars from a state program created to promote the greening of Maryland.\The subsidies were established in 2004 to help wind turbines, solar panels and other clean technologies compete with fossil fuels, which emit pollution that blankets the planet, melting polar ice, raising sea levels and making extreme weather more likely. The idea was to give a financial boost to alternative energy sources that are both clean and renewable, but expensive to develop.\But many of the facilities that receive the subsidies - trash incinerators, wood-burning ""biomass"" plants, and the paper mill in Luke - spew millions of pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year, plus toxins that are harmful to people and the environment. The subsidies earmarked for clean energy come from a fast-growing portion of Maryland electricity ratepayers' bills. The payouts to carbon-emitting energy producers such as the Luke mill have totaled more than $100 million through 2015.\Black liquor - its formal name in the paper-making industry - is Maryland's largest source of renewable power. Paper factories across the Eastern United States supply a quarter of Maryland's renewable energy supply. Such wood-derived fuels make up the nation's third-largest source of renewable energy.\To Mike Ewall, who has spent years trying to convince lawmakers in Maryland and elsewhere to stop subsidizing carbon emissions, it's a shocking contradiction. ""That's money that could and should have gone to wind power,"" says Ewall, director of the Energy Justice Network, a nonprofit advocacy group.\But Todd Downey, manager of the Luke mill, says black liquor ""is clearly aligned"" with Maryland's goals to both recognize and develop a diverse portfolio of renewable energy. He says the mill ""is helping to shape a cleaner energy future for all Marylanders.""\And Greg Harvey, who ran the black liquor machine in Luke for a decade, takes it personally when mill workers are maligned as polluters - as if he's being accused of valuing a paycheck above his community.\""You're questioning my integrity,"" says Harvey, the president of the union that represents most of the mill's 700 workers.\The battle over black liquor demonstrates the complicated struggle beneath efforts to shift to cleaner forms of energy.\The waste-to-energy industry has also fought to win and maintain environmental incentives that were created to promote green power sources. The Wheelabrator trash incinerator on the Middle Branch in Baltimore is the city's largest source of air pollution. Yet, it has received close to $10 million in renewable energy subsidies since 2011.\Such investments have meant there is much less money available to support cleaner forms of energy, such as wind and solar farms. At the same time, clean projects are running into resistance in their communities, where people who might support a green future in theory don't necessarily want wind turbines or a solar array next door.\State lawmakers have long wrestled with the question of what sort of energy should be considered renewable.\Some argue: Certainly not black liquor.\A company town \Luke is a survivor of an era when blue-collar jobs were plentiful in rural America. The mill told workers where to live and provided the steam that heated their homes. For years, employees were paid in marks they could use at the company store.\Audrey Nolan, 104, immigrated with her parents from Spain and settled in Luke in 1921. ""We belonged to the mill,"" she says.\In its heyday, which lasted into the 1950s, the mill employed more than 2,000 people. Most of them lived in what are known as the Tri-Towns - Luke and Westernport in Maryland and Piedmont just over the river in West Virginia. Some were descendants of Hessians, the mercenaries who fought for the British in the Revolutionary War. Others were recent immigrants from Italy or Spain.\Families assumed that sons would join their fathers in the paper-making business. Fazenbaker was one of the early family names in the mill, local historian Patrick McCarty is proud to say - it's his mother's maiden name. He would have joined the three generations before him had his father not insisted he go to college and work in a profession other than making paper.\The mill community was like a family, McCarty said, making the Tri-Towns a cross between a company town and Mayberry. It was a place where McCarty could wander from the top of Westernport Hill across a bridge over the rocky Potomac to the top of Piedmont Hill by himself at age 6. ""It was the most wonderful place in the world to grow up,"" the retired school principal says.\But longtime residents of the Tri-Towns also remember when their surroundings weren't so beautiful. They remember how the steep slope across the Potomac from the mill was barren, stripped for lumber and too choked by pollution to recover. The river itself was opaque.\""You could not see the water,"" McCarty remembers of the 1940s and '50s. The floes of black liquor and other waste from the mill ""looked like icebergs,"" he says - icebergs that reeked of the rotten-egg, cooked-cabbage scent for which the mill is still known.\It was an uncomfortable part of life in a mill town, Nolan recalls. When black liquor would spill into the Potomac, she says, you didn't talk about it at the pulp mill.\A boost for clean energy\Generations later, mill waste would become the renewable resource that helps keep the machines running.\In 2004, to give clean power generation a head start, Maryland offered financial incentives to the renewable energy industry. The policy, known as a Renewable Portfolio Standard, was spreading across the country as a way for states to create high-paying jobs in high-tech industries and to advance a green energy agenda.\The idea was to create a bonus revenue source for companies that generate power from renewable energy, such as wind and solar, to reward them for their environmental benefits. For each megawatt of electricity they produce and sell, they can sell a certificate.\The state law requires utilities and retail electric companies such as Baltimore Gas and Electric, Direct Energy and Pepco to buy those certificates from power producers within the PJM energy grid, which serves the Mid-Atlantic and part of the Midwest. Some of those producers are in Maryland, but most of the certificates bought by Maryland utilities come from producers in other states.\The utilities pass the cost on to residents and businesses in the rates they charge for electricity. Proponents say it's a reasonable way of attaching a value to the support many residents have for green energy.\The amount residential ratepayers pay for the renewable energy certificates is at most a few dollars a month, but it adds up. Proceeds for all types of renewable energy in Maryland's portfolio have grown to $127 million in 2015, the most recent year for which totals are available.\For the largest energy producers, the incentives can reach millions of dollars.\By 2020, Maryland utilities will need to buy enough of the credits to equal one-fourth of the state's energy supply. By then, state legislative analysts predict, the cost to the average household will peak at somewhere between 77 cents and $3 per month.\Maryland's biggest suppliers of renewable energy - the generators that get the most money from the ratepayer subsidies - include paper mills in Covington, Va., and Kingsport, Tenn.; a biomass facility that burns logging waste in South Boston, Va.; and two trash incinerators in Maryland: the Wheelabrator Baltimore facility near Russell Street and Covanta Montgomery in Dickerson.\More than three-quarters of the renewable energy subsidized by Maryland ratepayers is generated outside the state.\To Ewall of the Energy Justice Network, that statistic undermines arguments that the renewable energy incentives can grow jobs in the state. What, he asks, do Marylanders owe to a paper mill in Tennessee?\""Why should all this Maryland ratepayer money flow to them?"" he asks.\Black liquor\Of equal concern to some is that the renewable energy credits are going to dirty sources such as black liquor.\It was part of the program from the beginning, thanks to nearly a dozen amendments that MeadWestvaco Corp., then the Luke mill's owner, persuaded lawmakers to adopt during the legislative process in 2004, General Assembly documents show.\The paper industry argues that black liquor earns the ""renewable"" designation because it's burned as part of an efficient process: As power is generated, the harsh chemicals used to create paper pulp are also being recovered from the sludge. They are reused in the next paper-making cycle.\And as trees are consumed to make the paper, more can be planted. Richard Watro, the Luke mill's manager from 2011 to 2015, likens it to harvesting and replanting corn to create ethanol.\Verso Corp., which assumed ownership of the mill in 2015, says the carbon stored inside trees always makes its way into the atmosphere, whether through natural decomposition or forest fires. Burning black liquor is no different from the natural carbon cycle, company officials say, and the energy it generates means the mill can rely less on its other energy sources, coal or natural gas.\Mill workers say the fuel's main problem is its name. ""If you called it 'dandelion liquor,' no one would care,"" Harvey says.\Paper mills generate less energy than power plants, and emit less pollution. But they still give off millions of pounds of carbon dioxide every year. They also release other harmful pollutants, including smog-creating nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.\Last year, as the Luke Mill burned a combination of coal, gas and black liquor, it gave off 20 pounds of lead and 100 tons of methane. That was about the same as the Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner coal- and gas-fired power plant complex in Pasadena in 2015, according to the annual emissions inventories that power generators must file with the state. The paper mill emitted more than half as much sulfur dioxide, a pollutant that can trigger lung disease, as the power plants.\""It's better than burning coal, but it's not a renewable energy source in my mind,"" Del. Shane Robinson says. The Montgomery County Democrat has pushed legislation to stop rewarding black liquor as renewable energy.\Paper mills in Maryland and other states received about $60 million of Maryland's renewable energy subsidies through 2015 - nearly a fifth of the total. That included about $4 million for the Luke Mill, where black liquor produces about 40 percent of the mill's energy, Public Service Commission data indicates. (The PSC does not release precise figures, only the number of certificates each facility sells and the average price of all certificates.)\It was money that helped the mill amid the fluctuating demand for paper and pressure to reduce prices. Mill officials say demand for paper is declining at a rate of 5 percent each year.\Beginning in 2013, the subsidy came under threat. Environmentalists began to focus on the subsidies going to Luke and the other paper mills. They felt a program intended to spur the development of clean energy was paying to perpetuate dirty energy. They decided it was time to try to cut the paper mills off.\Mike Tidwell, director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, equated black liquor with pink slime, the maligned beef additive made from meat processing leftovers. He said black liquor seemed innocuous when lawmakers added it to the state's menu of green power, and that no one knew how much of the subsidy money it would command.\""Today we do know,"" he says. ""And it's a lot.""\In Luke, this was a new danger to the community's survival.\Luke under siege\For years, the community had weathered the combined pressures of environmental regulation, foreign competition and declining demand. The same forces had closed other blue-collar job centers around Cumberland - the Celanese textile plant in 1983 and the Kelly-Springfield tire factory in 1987.\As the population thinned and tax revenue waned, the number of public high schools in Allegany County shrank from seven to three.\Mill workers say pressure to cut pollution began in the 1950s, when a wastewater treatment plant opened just downriver from the mill. By the 1970s, a 600-foot smokestack rose from the mill to lift emissions high above the valley. Those and other investments likely improved the fortunes of the once-bare mountain opposite the river from the mill. The peak once called ""Baldy"" is now covered in thick forest.\Verso, the mill's current owner, says former and current management has invested more than $200 million since the 1950s in protecting the environment. That includes the installation of a succession of recovery boilers, which burn black liquor and capture chemicals that can be reused to make more paper.\In a 1975 ad in the Cumberland Sunday Times, the mill touted a state-of-the-art boiler installed three years earlier, said to be the tallest building between Baltimore and Pittsburgh. It said the $10 million machine was part of a ""progressive and costly effort"" to invest some $37 million in pollution controls over the previous two decades - an amount worth at least $168 million today.\The efforts helped restore the local environment. Today, groups of anglers catch trout downriver of the mill, and a bald eagle roosts near its lumber yard - wildlife that Harvey would never have expected to see when he started working at the mill in the 1980s.\""I believe they have grown into being very good stewards of the environment,"" Harvey says.\But the outlay also made it more difficult for the mill to compete, especially as paper mills began appearing around the Pacific Rim in the 1980s.\It was also the time when readership of printed magazines and newspapers began to decline. The combination of pressures wracked the Luke mill as it forced the closure of other paper mills across the country. \Dozens of mills have closed since 2000, and more than 200,000 jobs have disappeared. The industry now employs about 370,000 people.\Luke's paper-making machines were closed down one by one. From as many as seven that ran through World War II, only two remain. (With new technology, they make the mill more efficient and productive than it has ever been.) \The oldest paper machines, which press and heat wood pulp until it rolls out in massive rolls, were rendered obsolete and sold to Pakistan.\With each contraction, mill workers grew more anxious.\Gary Custer worked as an engineer and manager at the mill for some 25 years before leaving in 2014. ""Every move that happens, the whole work force feels that and starts to wonder what's going on,"" he says.\The turmoil is felt in Luke, where a town of more than a thousand people in 1930 has dwindled to 63, according to the census. For generations, steam from the mill heated Luke's homes for no more than $20 a month. But that heating supply was cut off in 2010.\New worries spring up every time the mill is sold to a new owner. In the past dozen years, it has passed from the Luke family business through two separate corporations to Verso.\Neighbors say they used to be so close with mill managers, they would know when and why the mill might temporarily suspend production. Now, they say, with Verso's corporate offices in Ohio, they find out only when the valley goes dark, and traffic disappears.\Annapolis showdown\Harvey, president of United Steelworkers Local 676, had never been to Annapolis when he and a dozen of his fellow mill workers loaded up in two vans on a chilly morning in March 2013 for the three-and-a-half-hour trek from Luke to the capital.\They were nervous. The territory was unfamiliar, and the outcome uncertain. Environmentalists were urging the state to stop sending ratepayer money to paper mills. The steelworkers union and mill management had been working with lawmakers and the administration of Gov. Martin O'Malley on a compromise. The deal would maintain the subsidies - and the jobs they support - for the Luke mill only, not paper mills outside Maryland.\But the deal fell apart. The Luke mill and its workers rejected it, saying that because the money was vital to the whole paper industry, they decided it wasn't fair to accept special treatment.\Now, Harvey and his comrades were in Annapolis to fight for the subsidy. The union and mill management thought workers' voices could be most powerful against their opposition.\At a Senate hearing on a bill to take away the subsidies, Harvey sat and waited for his turn to speak. He watched as Tidwell, of the climate action network, held up a vial of thick black liquor. Tidwell argued that the bill to cut off the subsidy to the paper mill was a rare ""no-brainer"" that should pass the General Assembly easily.\A coalition of environmental groups urged lawmakers on with a slogan: ""End the gimmicks. End the loopholes."" Administration officials suggested that the paper industry didn't need the subsidies because it would burn black liquor even without the extra money.\""They have been doing this for decades,"" said Kevin Lucas, then director of energy market strategies for the Maryland Energy Administration. ""They will continue to do it as standard operating procedure, independent of whether we are paying them.""\State Sen. Rob Garagiola, the bill's sponsor, stressed that the state Renewable Portfolio Standard should channel ratepayer money only to new and clean energy technologies. ""The RPS was not intended to be the crutch to keep a business open,"" the Montgomery County Democrat said.\The mill workers sat in the back of the hearing room. They wore matching T-shirts urging legislators to reject Senate Bill 684.\Richard Watro, then the Luke mill's manager, responded by expressing frustration at hearing the mill called ""old"" and ""dirty"" when he had seen hundreds of millions of dollars invested into new technology over three decades.\Jim Strong, the steelworkers' Maryland director, said the legislation threatened thousands of jobs in the paper business. ""Once you lose an industry to another country, that industry doesn't come back,"" he said.\Harvey was the last person to testify. His nerves were frayed. He practically shouted into the microphone. ""I'm the guy who burns the black liquor,"" he announced. He pleaded for lawmakers to spare his members another setback. The union had already fought through the foreign competition, the corporate mergers, the contract negotiations.\""The last thing I want to do,"" he said, ""is go to my 617 union members and tell them, 'By the way, you're the next victim.'""\The group left for the long drive home not knowing whether to be satisfied or relieved. \Within weeks, lawmakers came up with an offer similar to a proposal they'd floated before the hearing: The paper mills would lose the subsidies, but the governor would grant the Luke mill cash from state coffers each year to offset the loss. It was a win for environmentalists and for the workers of Western Maryland, or so it seemed.\The mill balked again. They couldn't be sure future governors would honor the deal. And they rejected the special treatment.\The attempts at compromise by the Democratic governor and environmental allies in the General Assembly had failed. And the legislation was defeated.\Momentum shifts\For the workers in Luke, it was a victory. But there was still a sense that Annapolis did not understand the town or the mill. ""This is Appalachia,"" says McCarty, the local historian. ""The words for stranger and enemy are the same thing.""\For three years, bills returned, and environmentalists repeated their arguments: Black liquor is dirty, and ratepayer subsidies should be reserved for new technologies.\Harvey returned to Annapolis, begrudgingly.\""We battle foreign competition and industry competitors,"" he told legislators in 2014. ""Now we have to fight changes in government regulation.""\But then the winds changed.\The Obama administration's Environmental Protection Agency issued a draft report in which it affirmed that burning black liquor adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere - but said that with sustainable replanting, the cycle could be made carbon-neutral. The paper mill seized on it like a shield.\Last year, the mill's workers made their case in the form of a four-and-a-half minute video they delivered to Annapolis. To the soundtrack of a strumming banjo, lawmakers saw views of the lush forests and bubbling Potomac, all alongside the steaming smokestacks.\Harry Stafford, a safety advocate at the mill, explains that the mill raised him and put his three daughters through college.\""If this mill wasn't here, there would be a giant void,"" he says in the video. ""Everything about it touches an awful lot of people.""\The momentum shifted. Lawmakers said they had revived the issue at the behest of environmentalists, but they no longer believed that a bill ending the black liquor subsidy could pass.\Del. Jeff Waldstreicher offered several bills over the years that would have ended the paper mills' subsidies. It became obvious to the Montgomery County Democrat that the issue was stoking a conflict between key Democratic constituencies: environmentalists and labor. Dividing them would never allow enough votes to pass a black liquor measure.\""Bills are about counting to a certain number in committee,"" Waldstreicher says. ""A frontal assault on this issue will not be successful.""\And so environmentalists have largely given up the fight in Maryland. They have chosen to focus instead on expanding the state's renewable energy supply to cover half or even all of Maryland's energy needs, up from the current 25 percent goal for 2020.\Groups including the Maryland Clean Energy Jobs Initiative and the Maryland League of Conservation Voters are campaigning to take the ""renewable"" label away from household trash, but not black liquor.\Years after comparing black liquor to pink slime, Tidwell says, there is reluctance to antagonize the Luke mill any further.\""The General Assembly came very close to closing the black liquor loophole in 2013,"" he says. But he doesn't think that could happen today - there is no longer the political will.\sdance@baltsun.com\twitter.com/ssdance\About the series\This project was supported with a grant from the Society of Environmental Journalists, a professional organization dedicated to increasing and improving coverage of environmental issues.\Coming soon\The Greenwashing of Trash: A trash incinerator in Southwest Baltimore has received millions of dollars in subsidies since state lawmakers declared it ""green"" in 2011, but residents who have endured a legacy of pollution hope to shut it down.\Going Green: One wind farm project in Western Maryland is 16 years in the making but still battling community opposition, an example of the challenges that can arise as the green economy of the future becomes a reality.\Credit: By Scott Dance - The Baltimore Sun - sdance@baltsun.com;twitter.com/ssdance\Caption: The 228-acre Verso paper mill dwarfs the town of Luke on the banks of the Potomac River in Western Maryland.

392,"What would you do, if the job that you had was gone in an instant? Without savings or a safety net, and with no degree or technical job training, it can be hard to bounce back.\That's what happened to my colleague, Steven Vernon. He lost everything after the recession. But he pulled himself back up with the help of his friends and community.\He enrolled in a solar installation job training program in the District of Columbia, Solar Works DC, led by GRID Alternatives Mid-Atlantic, the Department of Employment Services, and the Department of Energy and Environment.\He now works full-time as part of our solar installation team and has been active in advocating for better solar policy in his old stomping grounds, and my home state, Maryland. Earlier this month he testified before Maryland's General Assembly in support of the Clean Energy Jobs Act.\Maryland, once a leader in solar opportunities, needs to catch back up. Last month, the Solar Foundation reported that in 2018 there was a loss of 800 solar jobs in Maryland, the largest drop in the country. It's time to get things back on track and policy like CEJA is needed immediately.\If passed, CEJA's 50 percent renewable portfolio standard (RPS) would create an estimated 20,000 new Maryland jobs through 2028. Additionally, good clean energy policy attracts investment dollars as more large corporations such as Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Google are committing to using 100 percent renewable energy. Opportunities like these would benefit communities like mine in Annapolis and Anne Arundel County, which are struggling to retain a younger workforce.\When GRID Alternatives Mid-Atlantic started in 2014, Maryland's Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) market helped us and our community partners to install solar energy systems at no up-front cost on ten homes in the CARE Community of East Baltimore and on thirty-one homes in the Morgan Community Mile in Northeast Baltimore, while also providing training in the solar industry to local residents.\Since the state's SREC markets fell in 2016, however, Maryland has not been a viable market for us to continue our workforce development programs and solar projects for low-income clients. Maryland's lower SREC prices leave a larger gap for GRID Mid-Atlantic to fill with philanthropy or other sources. CEJA would solve the SREC market problem.\We urge the Maryland General Assembly to pass CEJA this year because we don't want to be shut out of Maryland for another year and make potential job trainees in the state also wait indefinitely for those opportunities.\Additionally, if CEJA is delayed by even just a year, the state would lose about $250 million of the Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit, which begins phasing out in 2020.\Steven's story is just one of many examples of strong solar policy creating well-paid career opportunities. A successful transition to clean energy will require a strong, skilled workforce and today's solar economy is creating real opportunity for people experiencing employment barriers and individuals in economically disadvantaged communities.\The average wage for a mid-level solar installation position is higher than the national average, and companies report that a bachelor's degree was required for only about 20 percent of new hires.\Creating pathways to good solar careers for young people in disadvantaged communities, for individuals impacted by the criminal justice system, and for those underrepresented in today's solar industry will develop the workforce that Maryland companies need to grow while creating economic opportunity for all communities to thrive.\The future of solar is looking bright, but it's going to take passing the Clean Energy Jobs Act this year and building on that with a deliberate focus on workforce development to realize the industry's full potential in Maryland. \Chris Sewell is the Finance and Operations Director at GRID Alternatives Mid-Atlantic.

393,"Voter ID laws don't target minorities\All this talk of voter ID laws targeting minorities makes me sick (""Messing with voting rights in Texas,"" Oct. 20). \Your editorial mentions the millions of people who lack an official government ID. The question is what those millions of people can actually do without an official ID, because here are some things they cannot do: \Get a job; apply for unemployment, welfare, food stamps or Medicaid; rent or buy a residence or a cell phone; drive a car; buy alcohol or cigarettes; get a prescription or buy cold medicine; receive Social Security. \Considering that your editorial claimed most of these millions are poor, elderly and minorities, that would mean there's virtually no government assistance for them. Not true. \On the other hand, government IDs in Texas are just $16 unless you are over the age of 60, in which case they're only $6 -- and the state often will waive the fee in hardship cases. \Your editorial also fails to mention is that these ID laws have already been used in some Texas elections and that there has been no drop-off in the number of minorities who showed up at the polls. In fact there was a higher-than-expected turnout among minority voters during the Democratic gubernatorial primary earlier this year. \As a member of a minority group myself, I hate it when others try and tell me what is and is not racist, discriminatory or disenfranchising. People who have actually suffered through it know what that looks like, and voter ID laws don't remotely qualify as such. \C. Ramirez, Dallas, Texas \Boost Maryland's renewable energy capacity \Current power generation in Maryland is 52 percent carbon (coal, oil, gas) and 8 percent renewable (wind, water, solar). \The Renewable Portfolio Standard of 20 percent more renewable by 2022 is a step in the right direction, but it doesn't go enough. Our polluting ways are cumulative and if we are to avoid rather than merely postpone environmental catastrophe, we need a higher RPS now. \A 40 percent increase in renewable energy sources by 2025 is a realistic goal, considering that the rate at which technological advances continue to make wind and solar power more efficient and affordable. The prospect becomes more realistic by the day. \Individual generators plug into a larger, national grid so local change in demand is not always directly proportional to local change in production (cleaning air locally would be simpler if it did). \Therefore, our over-reliance on coal must be fixed in both directions: Top down (increased restrictions) and bottom up (less demand). \A big step in the first direction was taken when the Air Quality Control Advisory Council approved the Maryland Department of the Environment's new regulations for coal plants. \Now it's our turn to urge schools, businesses, etc., to install solar panels. Help Maryland take the lead by making a higher Renewable Portfolio Standard possible. \Kevin Kriescher, Baltimore \Balt. Co. bond bills a mystery \A few days ago, I received a sample ballot from the Baltimore County Board of Elections. I am a recently arrived resident of Maryland and consider this a worthwhile public service. Other states I have lived in did not provide such a guide. \The ballot did bring something to light that has been completely ignored in the run up to this election. I refer to the nine proposals on the ballot for Baltimore County spending. They total and the enormous sum of $277,699,000! There has not been a word of explanation about this spending by the County Council or County Executive Kevin Kamenetz. I suspect they are keeping mum about these proposals hoping that the voting public will blindly mark ""For Bond Issue"" and trust the county to spend it wisely. \Not so fast, is what I say. Explanation is needed. Not just meaningless phrases from the ballot language such as for ""operations and projects, preservation and greenway projects and community improvement projects."" Projects? Not good enough for me. What effect will this have on taxes? Where, how, when will this money be spent? These politicians love to talk about ""transparency,"" but where is the transparency in these huge spending proposals? I intend to vote against every one of them. I'll reconsider on another ballot when more information is given. We deserve more from the council and county executive. \Jerry Fore, Timonium \On guns, Hogan must have something to hide \It doesn't take much to recognize that a politician who refuses to release his answers to a questionnaire from an organization that lobbies the legislature may be suspected of having something to hide (""What did Hogan tell the NRA?"" Oct. 21). \There is now no hope of me ever voting for Larry Hogan for governor. \David Fischel, Columbia\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
394,"State lawmakers are drafting at least two bills for the coming General Assembly session aimed at cleaning up Maryland's renewable energy supply, which includes polluting fuels such as household garbage and a paper-making byproduct known as black liquor.\Proponents who have backed similar legislation in previous years hope concerns about climate change improve their chances. They say recent hurricanes, President Donald J. Trump's support for fossil fuel industries and a recent series of articles in The Baltimore Sun could motivate politicians to act. The Sun reported that a state program sends millions of dollars from electricity ratepayers to paper mills and trash incinerators, one of which is Baltimore's largest single source of air pollution.\But environmentalists nonetheless expect an uphill battle.\The same politics and economics that helped classify the paper and waste-to-energy industries as green energy producers - making them eligible for the subsidies - will be at work when the assembly convenes in January, they said. And there will be a simultaneous push to increase the total amount of money available in renewable energy subsidies, potentially complicating the issue, they said.\The 2018 elections, however, could change political dynamics.\""We hope that this is something that people want to run on,"" said Kristen Harbeson, political director for the Maryland League of Conservation Voters. ""We want to be incentivizing the energy of the future.""\Del. Dereck E. Davis, chairman of the House of Delegates committee that will consider the legislation, said he expects a complex debate over what the state should consider renewable energy.\""It's getting tougher to predict overall where the committee will land on that,"" the Prince George's County Democrat said.\Maryland has allowed generators of renewable energy to collect a slice of ratepayers' electricity bills since 2004. The program was intended to give clean energy a boost, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and emission of climate-change-inducing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.\State lawmakers decide what is deemed renewable energy, and the list of green sources includes not just solar and wind power but combustion of carbon-emitting fuels like black liquor, trash and landfill gas.\Those fuels have collected about $100 million in subsidies over the past dozen years. In 2015, they accounted for about half of Maryland's renewable energy.\There are at least two factions of lawmakers and advocates who plan to push legislation during the 90-day session that begins Jan. 10 to address what they see as a contradiction. They argue that including energy sources besides solar, wind and a few other exceptions amounts to subsidizing pollution.\A coalition of hundreds of environmental and community groups that calls itself the Maryland Clean Energy Jobs Initiative is already campaigning for legislation that would mandate that half of the state's energy supply come from renewable sources by 2030. Under law adopted earlier this year, the goal is 25 percent.\The legislation would also stop sending subsidies to trash incinerators, including the Wheelabrator Baltimore facility along Interstate 95. The Baltimore City Council recently passed a resolution pressing state regulators to reduce the incinerator's pollution, and lawmakers in Montgomery County, where the state's other large trash incinerator is located, recently called for an end to trash incineration subsidies.\""We're not out to shut trash incinerators down, at least my organization's not,"" said Mike Tidwell, director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network. ""We want to stop the improper subsidizing of trash incineration from ratepayer money and calling it renewable energy.""\Del. A. Shane Robinson is pushing a more aggressive approach that would set the renewable energy mandate at 100 percent of the state's power supply - that is, subsidizing enough renewable energy to supply all of the state's needs, even if other sources are still used. His bill would also deny the ratepayer subsidies to anything but wind and solar power and other clean technologies that are still being developed.\The Montgomery County Democrat said he does not see any good in less sweeping legislation if environmentalists all agree their ultimate goal is full reliance on renewable energy.\""Why ask for something that is less than what you want?"" he said.\Discussions on both bills are expected to start in the House of Delegates. While lawmakers are awaiting the results of a study of the state's renewable energy supply and subsidies, which was ordered this year and is due at the end of 2018, they said they are open to hearing the proposals.\Del. Sally Y. Jameson, a Charles County Democrat who sponsored the bill ordering the study, said she is wary of making major changes without a holistic look at a program that has been updated nearly three dozen times, by her count.\Davis said most of the members of his committee, House Economic Matters, were not in office or on the panel when many of those changes were considered, so that could also make it harder to pass legislation.\Much of the discussion is expected to center on the level of the renewable energy mandate and what it could mean for the economics of renewable energy investment and the cost to ratepayers. But advocates say the types of energy characterized as renewable, under what is known as the Renewable Portfolio Standard, are an important element of that debate.\""We can't expand the RPS as it stands with all of the dirty energy,"" Harbeson said.\There is sure to be some reluctance to change the policy because of concerns about jobs and economic development. The paper industry, including a mill in the Allegany County town of Luke, has for years fought to keep its subsidies - and won those battles. The debate over subsidies to black liquor has repeatedly ended in a stalemate between labor unions and environmentalists, both key constituencies for the Democrats who lead the General Assembly.\Lawmakers said they don't expect that conflict to resolve easily in 2018.\Del. John F. Mautz IV, an Eastern Shore Republican, questioned why environmentalists keep targeting the paper mill subsidies when they seem to get no closer to cutting them off.\""Are they really serious about improving the environment, or are they just pushing a political issue?""\But supporters of the legislation say they think the time is right, given increasing fears about climate change and election-year politics.\The Trump administration is considering new tariffs on foreign-made solar panels in 2018 that some say could stunt or reverse the industry's growth, and action on that or other energy issues could spur Maryland lawmakers into action.\""The way the Trump administration is undermining renewable energy, it emphasizes that states have to act now,"" said Vincent DeMarco, chairman of the clean energy jobs group. ""States like Maryland have to take the lead to protect the planet.""\sdance@baltsun.com\twitter.com/ssdance\Credit: By Scott Dance - The Baltimore Sun - sdance@baltsun.com"
